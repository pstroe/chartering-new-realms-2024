"History of the Kings of Britain, Book 1 Chapter 13
Aaron Thompson";Ad haec verba illius revertitur quidam consul nomine Subardus cum trecentis militibus, et impetum fecit in eum: cujus ictum Corineus praetenso clypeo excipiens, non est oblitus bipennis quam tenebat, sed erecta illa percussit cum in summitate galeae, percussumque, a summo usque ad imum in ambas partes dissecuit. Sed et confestim irruens in caeteros, bipennem rotans, stragem acerrimam facit, et nunc hac nunc illac discurrens ictus recipere diffugit, nec hostes prosternere quiescit: huic brachium cum manu amputat: illi scapulas a corpore separat: alii caput uno ictu truncat: alteri crura a summo dissecat. Omnes in illum solum, et ipse solus in omnes irruebat. Quod Brutus aspiciens, motus amore viri, accurrit cum una turma ut ei auxilium subvectaret. Tunc oritur clamor inter diversas gentes, tunc crebri ictus inferuntur, tunc in utraque parte fit caedes durissima. Nec mora, victoria potiuntur Troes, et regem Goffarium cum Pictavensibus suis in fugam propellunt. Qui vix evadens, partes Galliarum adivit, ut a cognatis et notis succursum haberet. Erant tunc temporis duodecim reges in Gallia, quorum regimine tota regio pari dignitate regebatur. Qui benigne suscipientes eum, promittunt sese unanimiter expulsuros ex finibus Aquitaniae externam gentem quae advenerat.;"At these words one of them, named Subardus, who was a consul, returns with three hundred men to assault him; but Corineus with his shield wards off the blow, and lifting up his battle-axe gave him such a stroke upon the top of his helmet, that at once he clave him down to the waist; and then rushing upon the rest he made terrible slaughter by wheeling about his battle-axe among them, and, running to and fro, seemed more anxious to inflict blows on the enemy than careful to avoid those which they aimed at him. Some had their hands and arms, some their very shoulders, some again their heads, and others their legs cut off by him. All fought with him only, and he alone seemed to fight with all. Brutus seeing him thus beset, out of regard to him, runs with a band of men to his assistance: at which the battle is again renewed with vigour and with loud shouts, and great numbers slain on both sides. But now the Trojans presently gain the victory, and put Goffarius with his Pictavians to flight. The king after a narrow escape went to several parts of Gaul, to procure succours among such princes as were related or known to him. At that time Gaul was subject to twelve princes, who with equal authority possessed the whole country. These receive him courteously, and promise with one consent to expel the foreigners from Aquitaine.";"At these words, a certain consul named Subardus returns with three hundred soldiers and charges at him. Corineus, blocking the blow with his shield, did not forget the axe he was holding; instead, raising it, he struck him at the top of the helmet, slicing his opponent from top to bottom in two. Then, swiftly rushing at the others and whirling his axe, he makes a fierce slaughter. Dodging blows now here, now there, he does not cease to strike down his enemies: to one he severs the arm with the hand, to another he removes the shoulders from the body, to a third he decapitates with a single blow, to another he cuts the legs from the top. Everyone charges at him alone, and he alone charges at all.

Seeing this, Brutus, moved by his affection for the man, hastens with a company to bring him assistance. Then an outcry arises among the different peoples, then frequent blows are struck, then on both sides the slaughter is most intense. Soon enough, the Trojans gain victory, driving King Goffarius and his Poitevins to flee. Barely escaping, he reaches the parts of Gaul to seek support from his relatives and acquaintances. There were, at that time, twelve kings in Gaul, governing the entire region with equal authority. Welcoming him kindly, they all promise unanimously to expel the foreign nation that had arrived within the borders of Aquitaine.";"At these words of his, a certain consul named Subardus returned with three hundred soldiers, and made an attack upon him; He dissected both parts. But immediately he rushes upon the others, swinging his bipene, and makes the most severe destruction, and now running this way and that, he flees to receive the blows, and does not pause to prostrate his enemies: he cuts off the arm of one with his hand: he separates the shoulders from the body; dissects the top All rushed upon him alone, and he alone upon all. When Brutus saw this, moved with love for the man, he ran with a company to help him. Then there arose a cry among the different nations, then frequent blows were inflicted, then the most severe slaughter took place on both sides. Without delay, the Trojans were victorious, and King Goffarius and his Pictavens were put to flight. He, scarcely escaping, went to the parts of Gaul, that he might be helped by his relatives and acquaintances. There were at that time twelve kings in Gaul, under whose rule the whole country was governed with equal dignity. Those who kindly received him promised to expel with one accord from the borders of Aquitaine the foreign nation that had arrived.";A consul named Subardus, accompanied by 300 soldiers, responded to these words and attacked. Corineus, parrying the blow with his shield, remembered the double-axe he carried. Raising it high, he struck the helmet, cleaving the enemy from crown to base. Charging into the throng, he whirled his axe, creating a bloody massacre. Dodging blows, he tirelessly felled his foes. One lost an arm, another his shoulder blades. Some were decapitated, others had their legs severed. All attacked him, and he attacked all.Witnessing this, Brutus, moved by admiration, charged with his cavalry to aid Corineus. A great shout arose as the two forces clashed. A fierce battle ensued, with heavy losses on both sides. Ultimately, the Trojans prevailed, routing King Goffarius and his Pictavi. Barely escaping, Goffarius sought aid from his kinsmen in Gaul. At that time, twelve kings ruled Gaul with equal authority. They welcomed Goffarius and pledged to unite against the invading foreigners.;"Then the king returned To The house of isaac, A consul named Subardus, with three hundred soldiers, and attacked Him, Whose impact Corineus pretended to be welcoming the shield, not forgetting the two-legged man he was holding, but alert she struck when he was on the top of the helmet and tapped it from top to bottom in both directions. But immediately, rushing onto the rest, rotating the two-year-old, causing a very sharp havoc, and now running back and forth on this moment, he scatters back and forth, and does not stop the enemy from squeezing: he cuts off this arm with his hand: to him he separates his shoulders from his body: to others he stunts his head with one stroke; to another he dissects his legs from the top. All in him alone, and he rushed all alone. What Brutus was looking at, a man's emotional love, ran out with one team to help him transport him. Then a cry arises between different nations, then frequent blows are inflicted, then the slaughter takes place on both sides very hard. No delay, victoria and The Troes take over The King Of Goffario with Their Tattoos on their flight. Who was barely dodging, attended the French parties to get help from relatives and acquaintances. There were at that time twelve kings in France, whose government ruled the entire area with equal dignity. Those who welcomed him kindly promise to retire unanimously to expel the foreign nation that had arrived from The border With Aquitaine."

"De Legibus, Book 1 Section 40
Cicero";Nam etiam sine illius suffimentis expiati sumus. At uero scelerum in homines atque in deos inpietatum nulla expiatio est. Itaque poenas luunt, non tam iudiciis—quae quondam nusquam erant, hodie multifariam nulla sunt, ubi sunt tamen, persaepe falsa sunt—at eos agitant insectanturque furiae, non ardentibus taedis sicut in fabulis, sed angore conscientiae fraudisque cruciatu. Quodsi homines ab iniuria poena, non natura arcere deberet, quaenam sollicitudo uexaret impios sublato suppliciorum metu? Quorum tamen nemo tam audax umquam fuit, quin aut abnueret a se commissum esse facinus, aut iusti sui doloris causam aliquam fingeret, defensionemque facinoris a naturae iure aliquo quaereret. Quae si appellare audent impii, quo tandem studio colentur a bonis? Quodsi poena, si metus supplicii, non ipsa turpitudo deterret ab iniuriosa facinerosaque uita, nemo est iniustus, at incauti potius habendi sunt inprobi.;But if the penalty, not nature, ought to keep human beings from wrong, tell me what torment would harass the impious when the fear of punishments has been eliminated? Nevertheless, none of them was ever so daring that he did not either deny that he was guilty of a crime or fabricate some reason for his own just indignation and seek a defense of the crime in some right of nature. If the impious dare to call it this, with what enthusiasm will good men worship such a thing, I ask!;For we have been cleansed even without his purification. But truly, for crimes against humans and the gods, there is no purification. And so, they pay the penalty, not so much by legal judgments—which once were nonexistent, and today are in many places absent, and when they do exist, are often false—but rather, furies pursue and hound them, not with blazing torches as in stories, but with the anguish of conscience and the torture of deceit. But if humans were to refrain from wrongdoing due to punishment, and not by nature, what concern would torment the wicked if the fear of punishment were removed? Yet none of them has ever been so bold as not to deny that a crime was committed by them, or to invent some cause of just grievance for themselves, or to seek a defense for their crime from some right of nature. But if the impious dare to call upon these things, with what enthusiasm, then, will they be respected by the good? But if punishment, if fear of penalty, and not shame itself, deters one from a life of wrongdoing and crime, then no one is unjust, but rather the wicked are to be considered merely incautious.;For we have been atoned for even without his perfumes. But truly there is no atonement for crimes committed against men and against gods. And so they play out punishments, not so much by judgments—which once were nowhere, today they are often non-existent, but where they are, they are often false—but they drive them and are driven by fury, not with burning fatigue as in fables, but with the anguish of conscience and the torture of fraud. But if punishment, not nature, ought to deter men from wrongdoing, what care should the wicked have by removing the fear of executions? None of them, however, was ever so bold as not to deny that the deed had been committed by him, or to invent some reason for his just pain, and to seek the defense of the criminal by some law of nature. What, if the wicked dare to appeal, with what earnestness are they finally worshiped by the good? But if punishment, if the fear of execution, does not itself deter ignominy from an injurious and criminal life, no one is unjust, but rather the impudent are to be thought unwary.;"For we have already been purified, even without those sacrificial offerings. But truly, there is no purification for crimes against humanity or impiety against the gods. Therefore, they pay the penalty, not so much through legal judgments—which were once nonexistent and are now often flawed or nonexistent—but rather through the torments of their own conscience. And if humans are not deterred from wrongdoing by punishment but by their own nature, what would be the point of punishment? Yet no criminal has ever been so bold as to deny their crimes or to seek some natural justification for them. If the wicked dare to appeal to such justifications, how can the good possibly respect them? And if punishment and the fear of punishment cannot deter people from wrongdoing, then no one is truly unjust; rather, it is those who are careless who are truly wicked";In fact, we are also purified without the incense of that. I swear to god that men are not exasperated. So there are no punishments for such trials—which once were nowhere, nowadays there are no multifarious ones where they are, however, very often they are false—but they are disturbed by furies, not by burning torch as in myths, but by anguish, conscience, and torture and fraud. What if people should not ward off punishment from injury by nature, what concern would vex the wicked by raising the fear of punishment? However, no one of whom has ever been so courageous, without being committed to or abusing and committing a crime, or just pretending some cause of his suffering, and seeking the defense of the perpetrators by some natural right. What if you dare to call the wicked, what kind of studio will be worshiped by the good? If, in the years of punishment, no offense deters itself from wrongful crimes, no one is unjust, but the unsuspecting ones are rather unapproved.

King James Version";"Homo natus de muliere, brevi vivens tempore,
repletur multis miseriis.

He comes forth like a flower and is crushed, and flees like a shadow, and never remains in the same state. And do you deem it worthy to open your eyes upon such a one as this and bring him with you into judgment?;"A man born of a woman, living a short time,
he is filled with many miseries.
Who comes out like a flower and is crushed

Do you think it just to judge such a creature, frail and fleeting?;A man was born of a woman, living a short time, lots of misery. He that goeth forth as a flower, and is broken., he fled like a shadow, and never remains in the same state. And worthy of such a leader to open your eyes, will you bring him to court?

Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

"Deuteronomy 19: 15-17
ESV";Non stabit testis unus contra aliquem, quidquid illud peccati, et facinoris fuerit: sed in ore duorum aut trium testium stabit omne verbum.

Aaron Thompson";Brutus vero potitus victoria, oppidum sexcentis militibus munivit: petivitque nemorum abdita: ubi Trojana plebs praesidium illius expectabat. At Pandrasus ob fugam suam fratrisque captionem anxiatus: nocte illa populum dilapsum resociare vacavit. Et cum postera lux rediisset, obsidere oppidum cum resociato populo progressus est. Arbitrabatur enim Brutum se immisisse intra ipsum cum Antigono ceterisque captivis quos ceperat. Ut ergo ad moenia accessit, explorato castelli situ, distribuit exercitum suum per turmas: diversisque locis in circuitu locavit. Indixit etiam ut alii egressum inclusis abnegarent, alii cursus fluminum averterent, alii crebris arietibus ceterisque machinis murorum compagem dissolverent. Qui praecepta effectibus exequentes, omni nisu contendebant quibus modis obsessos crudelius infestarent. Superveniente autem nocte, audaciores eligebant, qui dum ceteri labori fessi quietem soporis caperent, castra et tentoria ab hostium furtiva incursione tuerentur.;"Brutus, after the victory, reinforced the town with six hundred men, and then retired to the woods, where the Trojan people were expecting his protection. In the meantime Pandrasus, grieving at his own flight and his brotherÕs captivity, endeavoured that night to re-assemble his broken forces, and the next morning went with a body of his people which he had got together, to besiege the town, into which he supposed Brutus had put himself with Antigonus and the rest of the prisoners that he had taken. As soon as he was arrived at the walls, and had viewed the situation of the castle, he divided his army into several bodies, and placed them round it in different stations. One party was charged not to suffer any of the besieged to go out; another to turn the courses of the rivers; and a third to beat down the walls with battering rams and other engines. In obedience to those commands, they laboured with their utmost force to distress the besieged; and night coming on, made choice of their bravest men to defend their camp and tents from the incursions of the enemy, while the rest, who were fatigued with labour, refreshed themselves with sleep.";Brutus, having gained victory, fortified the town with six hundred soldiers and sought out the hidden areas of the woods, where the Trojan people awaited his protection. Meanwhile, Pandrasus, distressed by his own flight and the capture of his brother, used that night to gather his scattered forces. And when dawn returned, he advanced with his regrouped people to besiege the town. For he thought Brutus had confined himself within it, along with Antigonus and the other captives he had taken. So, as he approached the walls, after scouting the position of the fortress, he divided his army into companies and stationed them around in different places. He also ordered some to block the exits for those enclosed, others to divert the courses of the rivers, and others to use frequent battering rams and other machines to break apart the structure of the walls. Following these commands in action, they strove with all their might to attack the besieged more fiercely. As night approached, bolder men were chosen to protect the camps and tents from any secret assault by the enemy, while the rest, worn out by labor, took the quiet of sleep.;But Brutus, having obtained the victory, fortified the town with six hundred soldiers, and sought refuge in the woods, where the Trojan people awaited his protection. But Pandrasus was anxious about his flight and the capture of his brothers: that night he spent the night recuperating the fallen people. And when the light had returned, he proceeded to besiege the town with the rest of the people. For it was judged that Brutus had thrown himself into it with Antigonus and the other prisoners whom he had taken. When, therefore, he came to the walls, having examined the situation of the castle, he distributed his army by companies, and stationed them in different places round about. He also commanded that some should deny the exit, others should divert the course of the rivers, and others should break down the framework of the walls with frequent battering rams and other devices. Those who carried out the precepts with effect, endeavored with every effort to find ways to attack the besieged more cruelly. And when the night came on, they chose the bravest, who, while the rest, exhausted by their labors, took rest and sleep, protected the camp and the tents from the stealthy attack of the enemy.;Having secured victory, Brutus fortified the town with 600 soldiers and retreated to the hidden depths of the forest where the Trojan people awaited his protection. However, Pandrasus, distressed by his escape and his brother's capture, spent that night rallying the scattered populace. With the dawn, he led his reunited forces to besiege the town, believing Brutus had entered it with Antigonus and the other captives. Once at the walls, he surveyed the fortress and divided his army, stationing them at various points around the perimeter. He ordered some to prevent anyone from leaving the town, others to divert the rivers, and still others to batter the walls with rams and other siege engines. His troops worked tirelessly to harass the besieged. As night fell, he selected his bravest soldiers to guard the camp against any surprise attacks while the others rested.;Brutus, however, gained victory, fortified the town with six hundred soldiers, and asked for hidden treasures: where the trojan population waited for his protection. But Pandrasus was worried because of his flight and his brother's seizure: that night he had spent time to resocate to the people who had broken apart. And when the light is returned, investment is a town with rejected people development. It was a very Dumb decision to enter into it with Antigon and the rest of the prisoners they captured. So as he approached the walls, exploring the situation of the fortress, he distributed his army through the troops, and rented the surrounding areas in different directions. He also indicated that some would deny the exit including, some would divert the running streams, others would break the framework of the frequent bucks and other machines of the walls. Those who executed the rules with effects struggled with all efforts in which they were obsessed in ways that were cruelly attacked. But when the night was come, they chose more courageous ones who, while others were weary of hard work to take a quiet nap, would protect the camp and tents from the enemy's stolen invasion.

For indeed he had commanded him from the prison that he should submit himself and the kingdom of Dacia to him, and should give tribute every year, if he were allowed to depart freely with his beloved. He commanded also that he should confirm his agreement with a treaty of oath and hostages. Therefore, with the nobles having been called together, when this had been declared, all gave their assent that Belinus should agree to the request of Guichthlacus with the aforesaid condition. And so he himself agreed. And Guichthlacus, released from prison with his beloved, returned to Dacia;So When The Belino victoria had ceased, He convened all the chiefs of The Kingdom within The York council to discuss what their dacian king should do.

Aaron Thompson";Britannia insularum optima, in occidentali Oceano inter Galliam est et Hiberniam sita: octingenta millia in longum: ducenta vero in latum continens: quicquid mortalium usui congruit, indeficienti fertilitate ministrat.

Porro lacubus atque piscosis fluviis irrigua est: et praeter meridianae plagae fretum quo ad Gallias navigatur, tria nobilia flumina, Tamesis videlicet et Sabrinae, necnon et Humbrae, velut tria brachia extendit: quibus transmarina commercia ex universis nationibus ejusdem navigio feruntur. Bis denis etiam bisque quaternis civitatibus olim decorata erat: quarum quaedam dirutis moenibus in desertis locis squalescunt: quaedam vero adhuc integrae templa sanctorum cum turribus perpulcra proceritate erecta continent, in quibus religiosi coetus virorum ac mulierum obsequium Deo juxta Christianam traditionem praestant. Postremo quinque inhabitatur populis: Romanis videlicet atque Britannis, Saxonibus, Pictis, et Scotis. Ex quibus Britones olim ante ceteros a mari usque ad mare insederunt: donec ultione divina ob ipsorum superbiam superveniente, Pictis et Saxonibus cesserunt. Qualiter vero et unde applicuerint, restat nunc praelibare, ut in sequentibus latius explicabitur.;"Britain, the best of islands, is situated in the Western Ocean, between France and Ireland, being eight hundred miles long, and two hundred broad. It produces every thing that is useful to man, with a plenty that never fails. It abounds with all kinds of metal, and has plains of large extent, and hills fit for the finest tillage, the richness of whose soil affords variety of fruits in their proper seasons. It has also forests well stored with all kinds of wild beasts; in its lawns cattle find good change of pasture, and bees variety of flowers for honey. Under its lofty mountains lie green meadows pleasantly situated, in which the gentle murmurs of crystal springs gliding along clear channels, give those that pass an agreeable invitation to lie down on their banks and slumber. It is likewise well watered with lakes and rivers abounding with fish; and besides the narrow sea which is on the Southern coast towards France, there are three noble rivers, stretching out like three arms, namely, the Thames, the Severn, and the Humber; by which foreign commodities from all countries are brought into it. It was formerly adorned with eight and twenty cities, of which some are in ruins and desolate, others are still standing, beautified with lofty church-towers, wherein religious worship is performed according to the Christian institution. It is lastly inhabited by five different nations, the Britons, Romans, Saxons, Picts, and Scots; whereof the Britons before the rest did formerly possess the whole island from sea to sea, till divine vengeance, punishing them for their pride, made them give way to the Picts and Saxons. But in what manner, and from whence, they first arrived here, remains now to be related in what follows.";Britain, the best of islands, is situated in the western Ocean, lying between Gaul and Ireland: it extends eight hundred miles in length and contains two hundred miles in width. It provides, with unfailing abundance, all that is suited to the needs of humankind. For it is rich in every type of metal, possessing broad plains and hills well-suited to superior cultivation, where various crops flourish in their seasons due to the fertility of the soil. It also has forests filled with every kind of wild animal, with grasses that serve alternately as pastures for grazing animals, and flowers of different colors that produce honey for the bees that come to them. There are also green meadows in pleasant locations under airy mountains, with the clearest springs flowing gently in shining streams, whose soft murmurs lull those who rest on the banks. Furthermore, it is irrigated by lakes and fish-laden rivers, and, aside from the strait to the south by which one sails to Gaul, it extends three famous rivers, namely the Thames, Severn, and Humber, like three arms: through these rivers, goods from overseas nations are brought in by ship. In ancient times, it was adorned with twenty-eight cities, of which some now stand deserted with ruined walls, while others still intact hold temples of saints, their towers standing beautifully tall, where religious communities of men and women render service to God according to Christian tradition. Finally, it is inhabited by five peoples: namely, Romans, Britons, Saxons, Picts, and Scots. Of these, the Britons once occupied the land from sea to sea before all others, until, as divine vengeance overtook them for their pride, they yielded to the Picts and Saxons. Now it remains to give a brief account of how and from where they came, which will be further explained in what follows.;Britannia, the best of the islands, is situated in the western ocean between Gaul and Ireland: eight hundred miles in length, but two hundred in breadth. For it is fertile in every kind of metal, it has broad plains, and hills suitable for a rich culture, in which the varieties of crops produce the abundance of the clod in their seasons. It also has forests full of all kinds of wild animals: in the forests and in the alternate pastures of the animals they meet on the grass, and the flying bees distribute honey from the flowers of different colors. It has green meadows under the airy mountains in a pleasant situation, in which the clearest springs, flowing with a gentle murmur through the shining streams, irritate the sweet slumbers lying on the banks. Moreover, it is watered by lakes and fish-bearing rivers: and beyond the coast of the southern coast by which it sails to Gaul, three noble rivers, namely the Thames and the Sabrina, as well as the Humbra, stretch out like three arms: by which overseas commerce is carried from all nations by the same ship. It was once decorated with two dens and two four states: some of which are ruined by ruined walls in desolate places, while others still contain intact temples of saints with towers erected in beautiful height, in which religious groups of men and women render obedience to God according to the Christian tradition. Finally, it is inhabited by five peoples: namely, the Romans and the Britons, the Saxons, the Picts, and the Scots. Of whom the Britons formerly dwelt before the rest, from sea to sea: until divine vengeance came upon them for their pride, they yielded to the Picts and Saxons. However, how and from where they applied, now remains to be pre-selected, as will be explained in greater detail in what follows.;Britain, the finest of islands, lies in the western ocean between Gaul and Ireland. It stretches eight hundred miles long and two hundred miles wide, and is abundantly fertile in everything that humans need. Rich in all kinds of metals, it boasts vast plains and hills well-suited for cultivation, where a variety of crops thrive in their respective seasons. Its forests are teeming with wildlife, its glades and pastures provide abundant grazing for animals, and its flowers produce honey for bees. The island is graced with lush meadows beneath its mountains, where crystal-clear springs flow gently through sparkling streams, inviting peaceful slumber. It is also crisscrossed by lakes and rivers teeming with fish. In addition to the southern strait that connects it to Gaul, Britain is traversed by three great rivers—the Thames, the Severn, and the Humber—which serve as lifelines for its maritime trade. Once adorned with forty-four cities, Britain now sees many of its former settlements in ruins. However, some cities still stand, their magnificent temples and towering churches serving as places of worship for Christians. The island is inhabited by five peoples: Romans, Britons, Saxons, Picts, and Scots. The Britons were the first to settle the entire island, but due to divine retribution for their pride, they were eventually conquered by the Picts and Saxons. How and from where these invaders came will be discussed in greater detail in the following chapters.;"Britain is one of The best islands, located in The western Ocean between France and Ireland: eight hundred thousand in length, and two hundred in width on the continent: whatever matches the use of mortals, it serves unprofitable fertility. For every type of metal fertilizer, it has wide pansy plains, and hills suitable for intriguing cultivation, in which cereals of different fertility clumps come at their own times. It has woodlands filled with all kinds of wild animals: the owners resort to lawn feeding on lawns and alternating animals, and the flying bees distribute the flowers to honeydew of different colors. It has meadows under the rims of the mountains with a pleasant position of vegetation, in which bright springs emanating through glossy waterways with gentle rumble, irritating pleasant lulls lying on the banks. Moreover, it is irrigated by lakes and fishy rivers, and in addition to the southern border with which it is sailed to France, the three noble rivers, The Thames and The Sabrina, as well as The Shadows, stretched out like three arms: those overseas trade focused on the same boat from all countries. Twice, denis was also once decorated with four bisque cities: some of which are coated by demolishing walls in abandoned areas; while others still contain entire temples of saints erected with towers of perpetual tallness, in Which religious groups of men and women guarantee Service to God according to Christian tradition. Finally, five peoples were inhabited: The Romans, The British, The Saxons, The Scots and The Saxons. The British formerly settled before the Rest from sea To sea, until divine vengeance came because Of their pride, The Painted and Saxons ceased. Truth and where it applies, it remains to lubricate now, as will be explained in the following broader terms."

King James Version";"Scriptura Ezechiae, regis Iuda, cum aegrotasset et convaluisset de infirmitate sua.
Ego dixi in dimidio dierum meorum:
Vadam ad portas inferi;
quaesivi residuum annorum meorum.
Dixi: Non videbo Dominum Deum
in terra viventium;
non aspiciam hominem ultra,
et habitatorem quietis.
Generatio mea ablata est, et convoluta est a me,
quasi tabernaculum pastorum.
Praecisa est velut a texente vita mea;
dum adhuc ordirer, succidit me:
de mane usque ad vesperam finies me.
Sperabam usque ad mane;
quasi leo, sic contrivit omnia ossa mea:
de mane usque ad vesperam finies me.
Sicut pullus hirundinis, sic clamabo;
meditabor ut columba.

cum ipse fecerit?
Recogitabo tibi omnes annos meos

corripies me, et vivificabis me.
Ecce in pace amaritudo mea amarissima.
Tu autem eruisti animam meam
ut non periret;
proiecisti post tergum tuum
omnia peccata mea.

neque mors laudabit te:
non exspectabunt qui descendunt in lacum
veritatem tuam.
Vivens, vivens ipse confitebitur tibi,

I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

I will go to the gates of the underworld;

in the land of the living;
I will no longer look upon mankind,
or the inhabitant of rest.

like a lion, he has broken all my bones:
from morning until evening, you finish me.
Like the young of a swallow, so I will cry out;
I will reflect like a dove.
My eyes are weakened, looking to the heavens.
Lord, I suffer violence: answer on my behalf.
What shall I say, or what will he answer to me,
since he himself has acted?
I will recall to you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Lord, if thus one lives,
and in these things is the life of my spirit,
you will correct me, and you will give me life.
Behold, in peace was my bitterness most bitter.
But you have delivered my soul
so that it did not perish;
you have cast all my sins
behind your back.
For the underworld will not confess to you,
nor will death praise you:
those who go down into the pit
will not wait for your truth.

I will rethink you all my years

Sir, if you live like this,
and in such things my spiritual life,
you will correct me and give me life.
I am in the midst of my deep bitterness.
You have rescued my soul
out of nowhere;
you threw it behind your back

And it is worthy of you to open your eyes upon such a thing,
and bring him to judgment with you?";A man, born of woman, brief of days and full of sorrow, Is like a flower that blooms and fades, a shadow that swiftly passes. Do you think it just to judge such a creature, frail and fleeting?;A man was born of a woman, living a short time, lots of misery. He that goeth forth as a flower, and is broken., he fled like a shadow, and never remains in the same state. And worthy of such a leader to open your eyes, will you bring him to court?

And so, I not only do not rush to hear your thoughts on civil law, but I am happy to let you spend this entire day on this broader discussion. For these matters, which you perhaps include for the sake of a higher purpose, are greater than the specific legal issues we initially intended to address.;The immortals, how far back do you begin? and so that i am not just going to do things that i expected from you regarding civil rights, but i will easily allow you to spend this day or the whole thing in this sermon.

ESV";"Scriptura Ezechiae, regis Iuda, cum aegrotasset et convaluisset de infirmitate sua.
Ego dixi in dimidio dierum meorum:
Vadam ad portas inferi;
quaesivi residuum annorum meorum.
Dixi: Non videbo Dominum Deum
in terra viventium;
non aspiciam hominem ultra,
et habitatorem quietis.
Generatio mea ablata est, et convoluta est a me,
quasi tabernaculum pastorum.
Praecisa est velut a texente vita mea;
dum adhuc ordirer, succidit me:
de mane usque ad vesperam finies me.
Sperabam usque ad mane;
quasi leo, sic contrivit omnia ossa mea:
de mane usque ad vesperam finies me.
Sicut pullus hirundinis, sic clamabo;
meditabor ut columba.
Attenuati sunt oculi mei, suspicientes in excelsum.
Domine, vim patior: responde pro me.
Quid dicam, aut quid respondebit mihi,
cum ipse fecerit?
Recogitabo tibi omnes annos meos
in amaritudine animae meae.
Domine, si sic vivitur,
et in talibus vita spiritus mei,
corripies me, et vivificabis me.
Ecce in pace amaritudo mea amarissima.
Tu autem eruisti animam meam
ut non periret;
proiecisti post tergum tuum
omnia peccata mea.
Quia non infernus confitebitur tibi,
neque mors laudabit te:
non exspectabunt qui descendunt in lacum
veritatem tuam.
Vivens, vivens ipse confitebitur tibi,
sicut et ego hodie;
pater filiis notam faciet
veritatem tuam.
Domine, salvum me fac!

I said, In the middle[a] of my days
I must depart;
I am consigned to the gates of Sheol
for the rest of my years.
I said, I shall not see the Lord,
the Lord in the land of the living;
I shall look on man no more
among the inhabitants of the world.

from day to night you bring me to an end;
I calmed myself[b] until morning;
like a lion he breaks all my bones;
from day to night you bring me to an end.
Like a swallow or a crane I chirp;
I moan like a dove.
My eyes are weary with looking upward.
O Lord, I am oppressed; be my pledge of safety!
What shall I say? For he has spoken to me,
and he himself has done it.
I walk slowly all my years
because of the bitterness of my soul.
O Lord, by these things men live,
and in all these is the life of my spirit.
Oh restore me to health and make me live!
Behold, it was for my welfare
that I had great bitterness;
but in love you have delivered my life
from the pit of destruction,
for you have cast all my sins
behind your back.
For Sheol does not thank you;
death does not praise you;
those who go down to the pit do not hope
for your faithfulness.
The living, the living, he thanks you,
as I do this day;
the father makes known to the children
your faithfulness.

and we will play my music on stringed instruments
all the days of our lives,

I will go to the gates of the underworld;
I have sought the remainder of my years.

in the land of the living;
I will no longer look upon mankind,
or the inhabitant of rest.
My generation has been taken away, and rolled up from me,
like the tent of shepherds.

while I was beginning, he cut me down:
from morning until evening, you finish me.

like a lion, he has broken all my bones:
from morning until evening, you finish me.
Like the young of a swallow, so I will cry out;
I will reflect like a dove.
My eyes are weakened, looking to the heavens.
Lord, I suffer violence: answer on my behalf.
What shall I say, or what will he answer to me,
since he himself has acted?
I will recall to you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Lord, if thus one lives,
and in these things is the life of my spirit,
you will correct me, and you will give me life.
Behold, in peace was my bitterness most bitter.
But you have delivered my soul
so that it did not perish;
you have cast all my sins
behind your back.
For the underworld will not confess to you,
nor will death praise you:
those who go down into the pit
will not wait for your truth.
The living, the living, he himself will confess to you,

I will meditate like a dove.

Behold, my bitterest bitterness is in peace.
But thou hast saved my soul
that it should not perish;
You threw it behind your back
all my sins

nor shall death praise thee:
they will not wait for those who go down into the lake
your truth

What do you mean, how do you respond to me,
how did he do it?
I will rethink you all my years

Sir, if you live like this,
and in such things my spiritual life,
you will correct me and give me life.
I am in the midst of my deep bitterness.
You have rescued my soul
out of nowhere;
you threw it behind your back

not looking forward to going down the lake
your truth.

For I see that your dear, famous Plato did so, at whom you marvel, whom you rank ahead of all [others], whom you greatly cherish.;But, if you ask what I am waiting for, since it has been written by you about the best state of the republic, it seems fitting that you should also write about laws: for I see that your Plato, whom you admire, whom you place above all others, whom you love the most, did the same.;And if you ask me what I expect, since it is written by you about the best state of the state, it will be seen that it follows that you write the same about the laws: for I see that your Plato, whom you admire, whom you put before all, whom you love most, has done so.;"However, if you ask what I expect, since you have written about the ideal state, it seems fitting that you would write similarly about laws; for thus I see that your Plato did, whom you admire, whom you place above all others, whom you love most";And if you ask me what i expect, because it is written by you about the best state, it would seem that, consequently, you write the same thing about the laws: for I have done so, i see That Your Plato, whom you admire, whom you prefer over all, whom you love the most.
"De Legibus, Book 1 Section 58
Cicero";Est huius uero disputationis, Quinte, proprium, id quod expectas, atque utinam esset etiam facultatis meae! Sed profecto ita se res habet, ut quoniam uitiorum emendatricem legem esse oportet commendatricemque uirtutum, ab eadem uiuendi doctrina ducatur. Ita fit ut mater omnium bonarum rerum sit sapientia, a quoius amore Graeco uerbo philosophia nomen inuenit, qua nihil a dis immortalibus uberius, nihil florentius, nihil praestabilius hominum uitae datum est. Haec enim una nos cum ceteras res omnes, tum, quod est difficillimum, docuit, ut nosmet ipsos nosceremus, cuius praecepti tanta uis et tanta sententia est, ut ea non homini quoipiam, sed Delphico deo tribueretur.;But surely the matter is such that since it is proper for the law to be the corrector of vices and the recommender of virtues, education about living is drawn from it. It so happens that [text missing] the mother of all good things, wisdom (from the love of which philosophy found its name in a Greek word). Nothing given to human life by the immortal gods is richer, nothing is more illustrious, nothing is preferable. This alone has taught us, along with all the other things it has taught us, what is most difficult: we should know ourselves. There are such force and thought behind this precept that it was credited not to a human being but to the Delphic god.;It is indeed the particular task of this discussion, Quintus, that which you are anticipating—and if only it were also within my power! But in truth, things stand in such a way that, since the law ought to be a corrector of faults and a promoter of virtues, it is led by the same doctrine of living. Thus it happens that wisdom is the mother of all good things, and from love of it, philosophy, a name derived from a Greek word, has been born, which nothing richer, nothing more flourishing, nothing more excellent for human life has been given by the immortal gods. For this alone has taught us not only all other things, but, which is most difficult, to know ourselves, of which teaching the power and meaning are so great that it has been attributed not to any mere mortal but to the Delphic god.;Fifth, it is proper to this discussion, that which you expect, and would that it were also within my power! But surely the matter is such that, since there must be a law correcting vices and recommending virtue, it is derived from the same doctrine of living. Thus it is that the mother of all good things is wisdom, from whose love the Greek word philosophy found its name, by which nothing more abundant, nothing more flourishing, nothing more precious than the life of men has been given by the immortals. For this, together with all the other things, he taught us, which is the most difficult thing, to know ourselves, whose precepts are of such force and opinion, that they should be attributed not to any man, but to the Delphic god.;Indeed, Quintus, the very essence of this discussion, as you anticipate, is something I wish were within my own capacity. But the truth is this: since law must be a corrector of vices and a promoter of virtues, it is from law that the doctrine of life is derived.Thus, wisdom is the mother of all good things. From love of wisdom, the Greek word 'philosophy' was coined. Nothing more abundant, more flourishing, or more beneficial has been given to human life by the immortal gods.For it alone has taught us, along with all other things, and most importantly, to know ourselves. The power and significance of this precept is such that it was not attributed to any human, but to the Delphic god.;There is a contentious, Quintus, peculiar, what you expect, and i wish it was even my ability! But surely this is the case, that since the amendment of the vices must be the law and the commendation of the virtues, we must draw from it a practical doctrine. It so happens that the mother of all good things is wisdom, from whose Greek word love philosophy has found its name, whereby nothing is given more abundantly by the immortal gods, nothing more flourishing, nothing more than man's life. For this one has taught us, together with all other things, as well as that which is very difficult, that we should know ourselves, whose commandment is so great and whose sentence is so, that it should not be attributed to Man as anything, but To The Delphic god.

Praeposuit itaque eis magistros operum, ut affligerent eos oneribus: aedificaveruntque urbes tabernaculorum Pharaoni, Phithom et Ramesses.
Quantoque opprimebant eos, tanto magis multiplicabantur, et crescebant:
oderantque filios Israel Aegyptii, et affligebant illudentes eis,

And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

So he set over them taskmasters to burden them with labor; and they built cities of storehouses for Pharaoh, Pithom and Ramesses.
But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and grew;
and the Egyptians hated the sons of Israel and afflicted them with mockery,

And they built for Pharaoh the supply cities of Pithom and Raamses. The more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread. The Egyptians hated the Israelites and made their lives bitter, subjecting them to harsh slavery, making their lives bitter by harsh labor under the burning sun, making bricks and working in the fields; in all their forced labor they were ruthless.";Now there arose a new king over Egypt, Who did Not know Joseph.

Vivens, vivens ipse confitebitur tibi,
sicut et ego hodie;
pater filiis notam faciet
veritatem tuam.
Domine, salvum me fac!
et psalmos nostros cantabimus
cunctis diebus vitae nostrae
in domo Domini.";"The writing of Ezechias king of Juda, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
I said: In the midst of my days I shall go to the gates of hell: I sought for the residue of my years.
I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more, nor the inhabitant of rest.
My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, as a shepherd's tent. My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he out me off: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.
I hoped till morning, as a lion so hath he broken all my bones: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.
I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove: my eyes are weakened looking upward: Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me.
What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it? I will recount to thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
O Lord, if man's life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live.
Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter: but thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.
The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: the father shall make thy truth known to the children.
O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.";"The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had fallen ill and recovered from his illness.

I said in the middle of my days:
I will go to the gates of the underworld;
I have sought the remainder of my years.
I said: I will not see the Lord God
in the land of the living;
I will no longer look upon mankind,
or the inhabitant of rest.
My generation has been taken away, and rolled up from me,
like the tent of shepherds.
My life has been cut off like from a weaver;
while I was beginning, he cut me down:
from morning until evening, you finish me.
I hoped until morning;
like a lion, he has broken all my bones:
from morning until evening, you finish me.
Like the young of a swallow, so I will cry out;
I will reflect like a dove.
My eyes are weakened, looking to the heavens.
Lord, I suffer violence: answer on my behalf.
What shall I say, or what will he answer to me,
since he himself has acted?
I will recall to you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Lord, if thus one lives,
and in these things is the life of my spirit,
you will correct me, and you will give me life.
Behold, in peace was my bitterness most bitter.
But you have delivered my soul
so that it did not perish;
you have cast all my sins
behind your back.
For the underworld will not confess to you,
nor will death praise you:
those who go down into the pit
will not wait for your truth.
The living, the living, he himself will confess to you,
as I do today;
a father will make known to children
your truth.
Lord, save me!
and we will sing our psalms
all the days of our life
in the house of the Lord.";"The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he was sick and recovered from his illness.
I said in half of my days:
I will go to the gates of hell;
I sought the remainder of my years.
I said: I will not see the Lord God
in the land of the living;
I will not look at man anymore
and the inhabitant of rest.
My generation is taken away, and it is rolled up from me.
like a shepherd's tent.
My life is cut out as if by a weaver;
while I was still rising, he cut me down.
from morning till evening you will finish me.
I hoped until the morning;
Like a lion, he broke all my bones.
from morning till evening you will finish me.
Like a swallow's chick, so will I cry;
I will meditate like a dove.
My eyes are narrowed, looking up on high.
Lord, I suffer violence: answer for me.
What shall I say, or what shall he answer me?
when did he himself?
I will think of you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Lord, if he lives like this
and in such the life of my spirit
You will correct me and revive me.
Behold, my bitterest bitterness is in peace.
But thou hast saved my soul
that it should not perish;
You threw it behind your back
all my sins
Because hell will not confess to you
nor shall death praise thee:
they will not wait for those who go down into the lake
your truth
Living, living, he will confess to you,
just as I am today;
the father will make a mark on the children
your truth
Lord, save me!
and we will sing our psalms
all the days of our life
in the house of the Lord";"Writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had fallen sick and recovered from his sickness.
I said in the half of my days:
I shall go to the gates of Sheol;
I sought the remnant of my years.
I said: I shall not see the Lord God
in the land of the living;
I shall not see man anymore,
and the inhabitant of quiet.
My generation has been taken away, and rolled up from me,
like the tent of shepherds.
My life has been cut off as by a weaver;
while I was still weaving, he cut me off:
from morning until evening you will finish me.
I hoped until morning;
like a lion, so he has crushed all my bones:
from morning until evening you will finish me.
Like the young of a swallow, so I will cry out;
I will meditate like a dove.
My eyes have grown dim, looking up on high.
Lord, I suffer violence: answer for me.
What shall I say, or what shall he answer me,
when he himself has done it?
I will recount to you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Lord, if one lives thus,
and in such things the life of my spirit,
you will chasten me, and you will give me life.
Behold, in peace my bitterness is most bitter.
But you have rescued my soul
so that it would not perish;
you have cast behind your back
all my sins.
For Sheol will not confess to you,
nor will death praise you:
those who descend into the pit
will not await your truth.
The living, the living himself will confess to you,
as I do today;
a father will make known to his sons
your truth.
Lord, save me!
and we will sing our psalms
all the days of our life
in the house of the Lord.";"The scripture of hezekiah, King Of Judah, when he was sick and recovered from his infirmity.
I've said it in half of my days:
Go to the gates of hell;
i searched for the remainder of my years.
I said, I will not see The Lord God
the land of the living;
don't look like a man anymore,
the quiet residents.
My generation is taken away, and it is turned away from me,
like a shepherd's tabernacle.
My life is cut down like a weaver;
while i'm still praying, it has cut me down:
the night ends with me.
I was hoping to stay;
like a lion, it crushed all my bones:
the night ends with me.
Like a swallow chicken, so i cry;
meditate on columbia.
My eyes are thin, my eyes are high.
Lord, i have come to suffer: answer me.
What do you mean, how do you respond to me,
how did he do it?
I will rethink you all my years
in the bitterness of my soul.
Sir, if you live like this,
and in such things my spiritual life,
you will correct me and give me life.
I am in the midst of my deep bitterness.
You have rescued my soul
out of nowhere;
you threw it behind your back
all my sins.
You don't have to confess hell to yourself,
death will not praise you:
not looking forward to going down the lake
your truth.
Alive, alive he will confess to you,
as i am today;
the father will make a mark on the children
your truth.
Lord, save me!
we sing our psalms
all the days of our lives

non timebo mala, quoniam tu mecum es.
Virga tua, et baculus tuus,
ipsa me consolata sunt.
Parasti in conspectu meo mensam
adversus eos qui tribulant me;
impinguasti in oleo caput meum:
et calix meus inebrians, quam praeclarus est!
Et misericordia tua subsequetur me
omnibus diebus vitae meae;

in longitudinem dierum";"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

"Exodus 7: 20-24
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition";"Feceruntque Moyses et Aaron sicut praeceperat Dominus: et elevans virgam percussit aquam fluminis coram Pharaone et servis eius: quae versa est in sanguinem.
Et pisces, qui erant in flumine, mortui sunt: computruitque fluvius, et non poterant Aegyptii bibere aquam fluminis, et fuit sanguis in tota terra Aegypti.
Feceruntque similiter malefici Aegyptiorum incantationibus suis: et induratum est cor Pharaonis, nec audivit eos, sicut praeceperat Dominus.
Avertitque se, et ingressus est domum suam, nec apposuit cor etiam hac vice.
Foderunt autem omnes Aegyptii per circuitum fluminis aquam ut biberent: non enim poterant bibere de aqua fluminis.";" And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: and lifting up the rod he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants: and it was turned into blood.
And the fishes that were in the river died: and the river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in like manner: and Pharao's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had commanded.
And he turned himself away and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to it this time also.
And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the river.";"And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded: and raising the rod, he struck the water of the river before Pharaoh and his servants, which was turned into blood.
And the fish that were in the river died, and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians of Egypt did likewise with their enchantments, and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the Lord had commanded.
And he turned away and went into his house, and even at this time, he did not set his heart on it.
And all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the river.";"And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: and lifting up the staff, he struck the water of the river before Pharaoh and his servants, which turned into blood.
And the fish that were in the river died: and the river rotted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.
And the sorcerers of the Egyptians did likewise with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.
And he turned away, and went into his house, and did not set his heart even this time.
And all the Egyptians dug water all round the river to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the river.";And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded. Moses lifted up his staff and struck the river in front of Pharaoh and his servants, and it turned into blood. The fish in the river died, and the river became foul so that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. The magicians of Egypt tried to do the same with their spells, but Pharaoh’s heart was hardened. He would not listen, just as the Lord had said. He turned and went into his house, and even then he would not listen. So all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink, since they could not drink from the river.;"Moses and aaron did as The Lord had commanded: and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters of The river before Pharaoh and his servants, and it turned into blood. And the fish that were in the river died: and the River was compelled, and The Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood throughout All The land Of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto Them, as The Lord had commanded. And he turned away, and went into his house, and set not his heart this time also. All The Egyptians dug around the river to drink water; for they could not drink of the water of the river."
