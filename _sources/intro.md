# Welcome to "Chartering New Realms: AI as a Catalyst in Digital Humanities"

This book (currently in the making) is (and at the moment rather "will be") the result of the BA seminar [Chartering New Realms: AI as a Catalyst in Digital Humanities](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/?sap-language=DE&sap-ui-language=DE#/details/2024/003/P/01144878) taught in the Autumn Semester 2024 at the University of Zurich. It's contents will thus be regularly updated until the final submission on **January 12, 2025**. If you want to dive right in, start with the [Preface](preface.md) or the [Introduction](introduction.md).

The aim of this course was to design it as a book writing process. Students needed to team up and contribute one chapter to this volume, where each chapter should be related to one of the ten seminar topics. As such, each student team contributed to the bigger project. Since we used [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) for the writing and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for publishing, the students learn how to write structured text in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and the basics of `git` functions. The reasoning for using Jupyter Book was that the students are supposed to write understandable, presentable, and executable code for the projects they describe in their chapters, so that others can directly use them. Hence, reproducibility is a side learning of the whole seminar. Since another focus lay on the writing process, we also worked on how to write good scientific texts, where the manual by Stephan Porombka [Wie man ein verdammt gutes Sachbuch schreibt](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/18452/6145/10.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) came in handy.

Overarching aims of the course are the following:
- Students should learn about the Digital Humanities (DH). What are the Digital Humanities? Where did they come from? What methods can we use in the Digital Humanities?
  - In the course of the seminar and the writing of their chapter, they should also find a definition of the DH that is directly linked to their interests.
- Students should become acquainted to some basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- Students should get to know tools that enable you to conduct research in the DH.
- Students should get insights about scientific publishing, including (peer) review processes. As such, every student had to do a peer review of another teams chapter.

If you are an interested researcher wanting to know more about either the DH or the teaching format, please do not hesitate to contact me (<phillip.stroebel@uzh.ch>).

Should you spot any typos or methdological flaws and issues, please contact me (or the authors) as well!

We hope you enjoy the result.
