<seg xml:lang="en">like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee. The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?</seg>

<note type="speaker">The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:</note>
<u xml:id="u_142020-02-25" who="#MINISTEROFHIGHEREDUCATION,SCIENCEANDTECHNOLOGY">
<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone. Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports. IsiZulu: Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni senza ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje. English: There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations. The main reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from the membership of such boards. The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities. The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs. In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance. IsiZulu: Sethemba ukuthi amalungu ahloniphekile aleNdlu azoweseka awuphasise loMthethosivivinyo ukuze siqubeke nalo msebenzi omuhle esiwenzayo wokusebenzisa ubuchwepheshe ukuze senze izimpilo zabantu bakithi zibe ngcono. Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] Mr M P MAPULANE: House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018. The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November 2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub- rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill. The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019. However, because the Bill focuses exclusively on the operational and administrative governance procedures of the entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation, no submissions were received from the public. The process to consider the amendment proposed by the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill was done in collaboration with the Parliament’s Legal Services, the Office of the State Law Advisor and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation exempted the department from the application of the socioeconomic impact assessment in respect of the Bill since it did not directly affect the public. The department briefed the committee on the Bill on 20 February 2019, two of the committee meetings on 27 and 6 March were dedicated to the clause by clause consideration and the adoption of the clause by clause amendments and the committee’s report on the Bill, which the committee’s report on the Bill and the allies were published on 11 March 2019. However, the committee’s report was not considered by the NA due to the conclusion of the of the Fifth Parliament’s term. The Bill was subsequently revived by this August House of the Sixth Parliament last year on 29 October and referred to the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education Science and Technology. Following the briefing by the department on 20 November, the committee considered the Bill and the amendments effected by the previous portfolio committee and we are satisfied that the substance and the processes followed are in order and therefore are confident that this House can adopt the Science and Technology Amendment Bill as adopted. The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. In doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have their own principle acts. The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council. It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees. The so called harmonisation has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014. The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South African National Space Agency Act; and the Technology Innovation Act. The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the termination of the membership of the boards or council, clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons of membership of council and provide for the appointment of external persons to committees. It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of the boards and council and their allowance. The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country. The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth. Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth. Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development. I thank you Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing. The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation. Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance. On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify the requirements for disqualification of persons from membership of boards and to provide for the appointment of external persons to committees of the boards. Considering the recent flawed processes of public entity boards as highlighted in the state capture reports, these amendments are crucial to ensure that the Minister and chairpersons do not have autonomy over the boards and to ensure that any amendment holds constitutional muster. The Western Cape government in its submission of the Bill expressed the importance of fit for purpose when appointed to the boards, the inclusion of an appeals committee and the chief executive officer, CEO’s term of office. Clause 22 interpretation of being convicted of fraud, corruption or any other crime involving dishonesty, within a period of 10 years preceding the date of nomination can be left open for abuse. The time period should have been realistically considered. Also placing the responsibility of determining fit for purpose in the domain of the court of law is limiting and should have been added an additional insertion of “or a competent tribunal”. The DA was in favour of deleting any clauses that were contrary to the Public Finance Management Act and the insertion of the disclosure of conflict of interest clause. All inputs from various stakeholders were brought into fruition in this Bill. A lethargic process to ensure enactment should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament regarding this Bill. Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress. I thank you. [Applause.] Mr M N PAULSEN: Hon House Chairperson, the role of science and technology, in particular research and development is the industrialisation and betterment of society. Highly industrialised countries have used science and technology to drive industry in addressing the country’s challenges. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socioeconomic development of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, academic publishing, patents and commercial applications and is now in some areas and by some measures a world leader. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. Cuba, despite continued sanctions is able to function almost independently because of the proper use of science and technology, but more importantly their leadership within science and technology. We have brother Blade and brother Buti. However, let us look at South Africa. Failure by the ruling party to reconfigure research institutions post1994, has resulted in these institutions continuing to operate in silos and playing no role in the reduction of unemployment and inequality. However also, science and technology is deemed as elitist with very little accountability to the ruling party. If it was not elitist, our focus would have been on issues which affects the poor masses in this country, the provision of decent water and sanitation, the harnessing of renewable energy where implementation would be driven by a capable and capacitated state. Minister Nzimande spoke of the Square Kilometre Array. Yes, it is in the Northern Cape, but the global headquarters are in the UK. These headquarters will ultimately be the owners of any intellectual property emanating from the Square Kilometre Array. However, I am not surprised by the Minister’s lack of understanding of things that really matter. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is burning and there are serious allegations that a security service provider is responsible for the problems at the KwaZulu-Natal campuses. It is poor students who are given the blame and Minister you are here sitting and speaking about the Square Kilometre Array. The purpose of this Bill focuses on the need to harmonise the entities within science and technology, but the Bill and these institutions are operating within a policy framework that prioritises research for selfish interest and greed. Harmonisation was already recommended in the Fourth Parliament and this House considered the First Amendment Bill in 2011. In April 2014, the Second Amendment Bill was considered. Essentially the Second Amendment Bill proposed the harmonisation of processes which included the appointment of chairpersons and members of boards of science and technology entities, the qualifications of board members and the dissolution of boards. However, what is laughable is the amendment of section 5 of Act 26 of 2008. Paragraph 8 says and I quote, “The board must be constituted in a manner that is broadly representatives of the demographics of the country.” South Africa is the only country where the government must make laws to empower the majority group of its citizens. Black people. In other countries the government makes laws to empower minority groups. That is how weak we are as a democracy and a country. The current Bill was proposed in the Fifth Parliament, but Parliament rose before the Bill could be considered. The current committee constitutes none of the ANC members of the Fifth Parliament. You have just replaced all of them, no continuity. The research and development budget has declined and there has been a loss of critical scientific skills. This department does not have a plan to ensure that Industry 4,0 does not lead to greater inequality between the working class and those who continue to enjoy their historical advantages. Although an aspect in the Bill is a step in the right direction, much more is required before the real benefit of science and technology will be realised. The EFF rejects this Bill. Thank you very much. [Applause.] Mr S L NGCOBO: Hon House Chair, this bill seeks to promote accountability and transparency of boards and councils regarding science and technology. We note the many technical amendments of this Bill in providing sufficient powers to ensure accountability and transparency in the boards and councils. The boards and councils oversee the work of various entities in this department and act as a strategic mechanism ensuring functionality. The IFP believes in making amendments that speak to appointing those who are fit and proper. We are glad to see the board and the Minister being compelled to engage each other in this regard as a first step in appointing people who are fit and proper, through this Amendment Bill. The consultation between both parties will reduce the potential for an individual to abuse the power. In a democracy, checks and balances are important in order to ensure that the people govern through elected individuals. Checks and balances work to promote accountability and transparency which must be the tool that people use to assess their levels of satisfaction with government. The public confidence in this department and some of its entities is currently low and these amendments seek to redress the lost confidence. We saw the clear indications of the lack of confidence during the portfolio committee’s oversight and presentations made to it. Public confidence must be built by showing that these entities are free from corruption, nepotism and patronage. These entities are seemingly run as if they are just a tuck shop. Currently, South Africa has been left in the wake of grand corruption by the former administration. We witness through many commissions and the Zondo Commission, of a clear lack of attention paid to checks and balances, accountability and transparency. We maintain that only people who show excellence and who are suitably qualified should be appointed in boards, councils or official positions. In doing so, we will start to realise a professionally skilled public service. However, these amendments alone won’t ensure the fully skilled public service that our nation deserves. We must guard against partisan relationships at board and council levels to ensure that jobs are given to those who are equal to the tasks required and not because they are friends of the Ministers or other people. The IFP supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.] Afrikaans: Dr W J BOSHOFF: Agb Voorsitter, dit is so dat wetenskap, tegnologie en innovasie een van daardie dryfkragte agter enige ekonomie is. In ’n ekonomie waar daar nie aandag aan die drie aspekte gegee word nie, kom so ’n ekonomie eintlik tot stilstand. Dit is dus goed dat hierdie en vorige regerings nogal aandag gegee het aan die totstandkoming van ’n hele aantal wetenskaplike instellings, waarvan nie almal in hierdie Ministerie saamgevat is nie, maar wel agt belangrikes. Hierdie agt het elkeen ’n ander agtergrond soos die RGN, die Raad vir Geesteswetenskaplike Navorsing, maar ook al die ander, wat op die menslike aspek van die ekonomie en die samelewing fokus. Elkeen het op sy eie manier tot stand gekom en daarom is dit ’n goeie idee om ’n bietjie belyning in die organisasie van hierdie instellings te bring. Dit is belangrik dat daar deur hierdie wetsontwerp erken word dat daar ’n geweldige skaarsheid - en die komitee het die woord “dearth” [skaarsheid] gebruik - aan vaardighede en kennis op die terrein van wetenskap, tegnologie en innovasie is. As ’n mens kan sien dat daar wel so ’n skaarsheid is, dan is dit eintlik onverstaanbaar dat ’n mens daardie skaarsheid kunsmatig vergroot deur middel van transformasieteikens en swart ekonomiese bemagtiging, deur te sê dat soveel persent van die kundiges uit ’n bepaalde seksie van die demografie moet kom. Dit verslaan eintlik die doelwit, want ons het reeds te min vaardighede. Ons moet elke persoon wat die kennis, die vaardighede of die ervaring het om in hierdie terrein te dien, betrek en verwelkom. Ons moet niemand onwelkom laat voel nie. Daar is baie keer ’n opvatting aan die regterkant van die Huis, maar partykeer ook aan die ander kant dat, as die VF Plus homself teen swart ekonomiese bemagtiging as ’n ekonomiese maatreël uitspreek, dit is asof die VF Plus sê dat swart mense nie in staat is om die werk te doen nie. Dit is baie ver van die waarheid af. Dit is nie die kwessie nie. Dit gaan daaroor dat enige mens, ongeag afkoms, nasionaliteit, opvoeding, ensovoorts, in ’n posisie gestel word, nie op grond van sy vaardighede, kennis of ervaring nie, maar op grond van ’n demografiese profiel. Verder, as daardie persoon, as gevolg van sy demografiese profiel, ook nie uit die pos vewyder kan word nie, dan is so ’n persoon geneig om nie juis te presteer nie. Verder, ’n ander persoon wat wel oor die kennis, vaardighede en ervaring beskik, maar demografies verkeerd geplaas is, gaan doodgewoon land uit na waar daar ’n behoefte is aan dit wat hy weet. Wat meer is, van die talle en talle en talle swart persone wat in oorvloed oor die kennis, ervaring en vaardighede beskik om hierdie poste te beklee, is so gesog, want elke staatsonderneming, elke privaatonderneming en elkeen wat sake in hierdie land van ons doen, wil daardie mense hê om hul bemagtigingspunte op te stapel en te kan sê dat hulle aan die wetlike vereistes voldoen. Dit beteken dat hierdie mense nooit lank genoeg in een pos bly om die ding werklik onder die knie te kry en dit tot sy reg te laat kom nie. As die VF Plus sê dat ons hierdie wetsontwerp ondersteun, maar dat ons dink dit moes verder gegaan het en ook gesê het dat swart ekonomiese bemagtigingsteikens uit die terrein van wetenskap en tegnologie gehaal moet word, dan is dit nie omdat ons sê dat dit mense is wat nie oor die vaardighede beskik nie. Inteendeel, dit is om erkenning te gee aan almal wat oor hierdie kennis en vaardighede beskik en die vermoë het om Suid-Afrika verder te neem. Mr W M THRING: Hon House Chair, the ACDP is cognisant of the fact that this Bill which deals with the amendment of the Scientific Research Council Act of 1988, the Academy of Science of South Africa Act of 2001, the Human Sciences Research Council Act of 2008, the Technology Innovation Agency Act of 2008, and the South African National Space Agency Act of 2008, essentially seeks to achieve the following: the harmonisation of the process for the terminisation of the membership of boards or councils, clarification of the requirements for the disqualification of persons from membership of boards or councils, as well as providing for circumstances where members of boards or councils are prohibited from participating or voting in the boards or councils meetings, amongst other things. Hon House Chair, if South Africa is to meaningfully compete in the science and technology space, then it must have the administrative capacity and strength to do so, because any organisation is only as strong as its internal ability to plan, strategise, envision and then implement. There can be no external growth if the internal capacity or core of an organisation has rotted or become weak. The ACDP is aware that this Bill seeks to strengthen the core within the science and technology sector. It is our view that if this is done properly, efficiently and transparently, the external knock on effect of preparing our students to become global players and contributors to the science and technology space can indeed become a reality. We, within the African Christian Democratic Party, believe that there is no lack of intelligence, ability and potential among the students of South Africa. To a large extent, however, there has been a mismatch with respect to the skills required by industry, and the skills produced within the education, science and technology sector. This is a recipe for disaster, and will continue to be a drain on our industrial and economic recovery, which is so desperately needed. In conclusion, as this Bill has the noble intention of harmonising termination processes and, in general, strengthening the administration processes in the boards and councils of the relevant entities, the ACDP is cautiously optimistic that this internal administrative strengthening process will have the positive leveraging effect of strengthening our skills capacity, and thereby unlocking the enormous potential of our students who will be able to do us proud in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The ACDP supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.] Mr S N AUGUST: Thank you, House Chair. Good notes the December 2019 recommendations from the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology that the National Assembly passes the Bill. We thank the multiparty committee for their work and welcome the amendments that aim to ensure that all public entities comply with the Public Finance Management Act. I also appreciate the submission received that anyone with a criminal record must be disqualified. However, from my own experience working in the justice sector, I know that, sometimes, criminals are able to be reformed. The amendment to disqualify any person convicted for fraud, corruption or any other crime involving dishonesty from being considered for a board position for at least a decade is accepted. However, we all know even without a criminal record, the wrong people can still be appointed. We have seen how corruption and maladministration results in the waste or theft of taxpayers’ money. To protect the poor and our country’s finances, Good welcomes the stronger measures to ensure compliance with the Public Finance Management Act and the Bill’s measures to clamp down on cadre deployment board appointments by requiring the disclosure of any conflicts of interests. Cadre deployment must be stopped. There are many qualified skilled people with no party affiliation that can do the job. It is a fact that cadre deployment has destroyed the independence, and often functionality, of government institutions. Good welcomes all efforts to stop corruption and cadre deployment and supports the amendments. Thank you. Ms J S MANANISO: Chairperson, Deputy President, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, hon members and fellow South Africans, I want you to note that during our deliberations members of the opposition party didn’t have a say. At least they have consulted and now we know that they are adopting the Bill. The ANC as the governing party remains committed to our people’s contract of better life for all. The ANC supports the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill. The current amendments are in response to the gaps identified in the previous Bill. Furthermore, it deals with codes of ethics and organisational culture. It has been a practice that most of the departments with common interest have been working in silos using minimum resources. The Bill is about harmonising the six public entities reporting to the department in working together, collaborating and sharing best practices. The ANC wants to assure the people of South Africa that the Bill has went through formal legal processes. The Bill is technical, administrative and is an enabling legislation that addresses and promotes the following: good governance, transparency`, accountability, professionalism - skill-based, knowledge-based and experience- based – skills retention, fair representation per demographics. Most of us normally talk about institutional memory. Colleagues, here we are not speaking about female and males, but we are speaking about gender demographics in terms of religion, sex, age, people with disability, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, gender queer, queer, intersexes, gender, asexual, and ally, LGBTQIA+, and everybody who is part of the society. Hon members, note that when we speak about science, technology and innovation we don’t speak human disruption, but disruptive solutions. Understand what I am talking about. Don’t disrupt us. We are speaking about disruptive solutions, information technology, IT, innovations. This amendment Bill speaks to uniformity and it has clear terms of references and time frames, which is five periods. It seeks to strengthen collaborations and intergovernmental relations and international relations. It is clear in terms of clarifications of powers and functions between Ministers and board council members and it speaks about value for money. The current amendments will ensure that as a developmental state, our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, play an important role in growing our economy in addressing societal problems through scientific research and technological innovation as recognised by the National Development Plan, NDP. It has been proven that the following entities work together in terms of knowledge production and innovation and the country is able to compete globally in science, technology and innovation: Academy of Science, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Human Sciences Research Council, National Research Foundation, SA National Space Agency and Technology Innovation Agency. The Bill is about redressing and transforming the system as it is constitutional mandate and we cannot negotiate the plight of our people. Scientific research and technological innovation in our life time is an enabling and necessary platform to fast-track our services to develop and grow South Africa together. It is important to note that we cannot speak boldly about economic freedom in our lifetime without investing in research and development and the advancement of science, technology and innovation. As we normally say young minds are innovative minds and investment therein is an investment into the future. Hon members, I would like to call on this august House to join the community of Mohlakeng in the West Rand in celebrating one of their own who has been appointed as first black female Geologist lecturer at the University of Pretoria, ms Mampho Maoyi. [Applause.] This shows that it is true when we say that South Africa is alive with possibilities. With this piece of legislation we must firmly place our nation at the centre of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in order to address our triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. There is nothing wrong with continuous planning. As the ANC we pride ourselves with the NDP. If we fail to plan, we plan to fail. Let's keep working local and think globally. As I conclude, Deputy President, hon Ramaphosa, His Excellency the President, in his 2019 in his state of the nation address debate emphasised on the significance of an activist parliament. In the same breath with the same matter of social compact, we would want to commit ourselves that we will, indeed, soldier on “thuma thina.” [send us]. Lastly, I would like to speak about the issue of hon Boshof. Thank you as well for giving the lecture to the FF Plus about us, black people, of being capable. I thank you. [Applause.] Mr M G E HENDRICKS: Hon Chair, thank you very much for the opportunity. It was very encouraging to listen to the Minister saying that the amendments are catalyst for economic growth. And I am very excited about the opportunities that the Minister highlighted for smart agriculture, and also that he is very keen that his Ministry will now drive the skills knowledge that we need. However, investment in research and innovation is still a Cinderella when it comes to building a modern South Africa for the 21st and 22nd centuries. All we seem to have is just a telescope. Our nuclear know how before apartheid has not been harnessed. It could have assisted us today with our electricity calamity, a calamity brought in by five parliaments. It looks like we have no hope of sending a space mission to the moon. So there is no ambition amongst our brilliant young scientists to aim for the skies. We do agree that the Minister must at least be consulted in the appointed of CEOs in state-owned entities, SOEs, so that he can take the blame if they mess up as it has happened over the past five parliaments. The Sixth Parliament must not be in the same boat. Science and technology opportunities, especially at the most senior levels, should have no racial discrimination. For once I agree with the hon members of the FF Plus. It is very important that South Africa takes advantage of the brilliance and the innovation of its citizens and no one should be left out to take South Africa to the 21st and 22nd centuries. Al Jama’ah supports amendments to the Bill.</seg>
