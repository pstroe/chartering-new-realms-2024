Here's the formatted text according to the provided example:

```xml
<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note> 
<who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty"> 
<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</seg>
</who>
```

**Explanation of the Formatting:**

* **`<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>`:** This line creates a note that identifies the speaker. 
* **`<who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">`:** This line assigns an identifier (in this case, `#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty`) to the speaker. This can be used for cross-referencing or indexing.
* **`<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</seg>`:** This line contains the actual spoken text, enclosed within `<seg>` tags. The `xml:lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the text (in this case, English).

This format can be applied consistently to the rest of the provided text to create a structured and machine-readable representation of the parliamentary proceedings.
