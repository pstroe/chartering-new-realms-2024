<seg xml:lang="en">Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do ministerial statements but there are not any Ministers in the House to hear them.</seg> 
<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto)</note> 
<seg xml:lang="en">I’m looking around the House and I can say that I see a Minister and two Deputy Ministers ... [Interjections.] ... and I believe ... Oh, I’m sorry, mama De Lille. I’m very sorry. I always look this side. My apologies. Mama De Lille is there. Let’s hope that as we continue they will arrive because these are the rules that we all adopted. Yes, hon Mente?</seg> 
<note type="speaker">Ms N V MENTE</note> 
<seg xml:lang="en">House Chair, to say we must proceed ... they will arrive ... how will they respond to something they did not hear?</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">Hon House Chairperson, I want to support the move that ... let’s start with the next item.
