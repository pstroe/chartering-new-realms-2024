  <speaker type="speaker">reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for thedetermination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities. The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs. In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.

[Ihlombe.] UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 9 Mr M P MAPULANE: House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018. The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November 2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub- rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill. The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019. However, because the Bill focuses exclusively on the operational and administrative governance procedures of the entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation, no submissions were received from the public. The process to consider the amendment proposed by the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill was done in collaboration with the Parliament’s Legal Services, the Office of the State Law Advisor and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 10 Evaluation exempted the department from the application of the socioeconomic impact assessment in respect of the Bill since it did not directly affect the public. The department briefed the committee on the Bill on 20 February 2019, two of the committee meetings on 27 and 6 March were dedicated to the clause by clause consideration and the adoption of the clause by clause amendments and the committee’s report on the Bill, which the committee’s report on the Bill and the allies were published on 11 March 2019. However, the committee’s report was not considered by the NA due to the conclusion of the of the Fifth Parliament’s term. The Bill was subsequently revived by this August House of the Sixth Parliament last year on 29 October and referred to the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education Science and Technology. Following the briefing by the department on 20 November, the committee considered the Bill and the amendments effected by the previous portfolio committee and we are satisfied that the substance and the processes followed are in order and therefore are confident that this House can adopt the Science and Technology Amendment Bill as adopted. UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 11 The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. In doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have their own principle acts. The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council. It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees. The so called harmonisation has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014. The current Science UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 12 and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South African National Space Agency Act; and the termination of the membership of the boards or council, clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons of membership of council and provide for the appointment of external persons to committees. It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of the boards and council and</speaker>

This XML structure attempts to address the speaker issue by:

1. **Using `<speech>` tag:** Encloses the entire speech within a `<speech>` tag. 
2. **`type="speaker"` attribute:**  Includes a `type="speaker"` attribute within the `<speaker>` tag, which could be replaced with more specific speaker information (e.g., `type="member"`, `type="chair"`, `type="minister"`) if available.

**Note:**

* This is a simplified approach. A more robust solution might involve separate `<speaker>` tags for each speaker in the text, with their names or identifiers.
* This structure assumes that the entire provided text belongs to a single speaker. If multiple speakers are involved, the text would need to be further divided and each speaker's portion enclosed within its own `<speaker>` tag. 

I hope this revised version is more helpful!
