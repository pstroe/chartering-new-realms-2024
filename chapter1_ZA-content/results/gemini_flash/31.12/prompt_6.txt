E $ help me format some text 

G $  can help you format text in a few different ways. I can:

    Change the font and size of the text.
    Make the text bold, italic, or underlined.
    Add bullet points or numbered lists to the text.
    Indent the text.
    Align the text to the left, right, or center.

To help me format your text, please provide me with the following information:

    The text you want to format.
    The specific formatting you want to apply.

For example, you could say:

    "Please format the following text:

    This is an example of some text.

    I want to make the text bold and italic."

Once you provide me with this information, I will be able to format your text for you.
