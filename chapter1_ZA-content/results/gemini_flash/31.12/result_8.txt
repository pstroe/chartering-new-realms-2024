<seg xml:lang="en">Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes.</seg>
<seg xml:lang="en">With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">Yes, what’s your point of order?</seg>
<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION:</note>
<who="#ChiefWhipOfOpposition">
<seg xml:lang="en">I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do ministerial statements but there are not any Ministers in the House to hear them.</seg>
<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
<who="#HouseChairperson">
<seg xml:lang="en">I’m looking around the House and I can say that I see a Minister and two Deputy Ministers ... [Interjections.] ... and I believe ... Oh, I’m sorry, mama De Lille. I’m very sorry. I always look this side. My apologies. Mama De Lille is there. Let’s hope that as we continue they will arrive because these are the rules that we all adopted. Yes, hon Mente?</seg>
<note type="speaker">Ms N V MENTE:</note>
<who="#MsNMente">
<seg xml:lang="en">House Chair, to say we must proceed ... they will arrive ... how will they respond to something they did not hear?</seg>
<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
<who="#HouseChairperson">
<seg xml:lang="en">We have others that will respond ... [Inaudible.] ... in the House.</seg>
<note type="speaker">Ms N V MENTE:</note>
<who="#MsNMente">
<seg xml:lang="en">No, no, no, no, no, no, the rule does not say that.</seg>
<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
<who="#HouseChairperson">
<seg xml:lang="en">The rule says seven ... yes, opportunities.</seg>
<note type="speaker">Ms N V MENTE:</note>
<who="#MsNMente">
<seg xml:lang="en">Yes, they are three now. They are currently three.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">Hon Mahlangu, how do we resolve this? We will resolve it together. Let’s resolve it together.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">After having adopted the rules I have to get advice because I can’t just flout the rules that we have adopted. Hon Chief Whip?</seg>
<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
<seg xml:lang="en">Hon House Chairperson, I want to support the move that ... let’s start with the next item. However, I must say it is uncalled for that we don’t have Ministers and Deputy Ministers in the House when they knew that Statements was going to be the first item. Thank you. [Applause.]</seg>
<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
<who="#HouseChairperson">
<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you. I think that is the wish of the members in the House. As the Chief Whip has spoken and supports what you are saying, and I am advised by Mr Mahlangu that it is okay, I will proceed that way.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">(Second Reading debate)</seg>
<note type="speaker">The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:</note>
<who="#MinisterOfHigherEducationScienceAndTechnology">
<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country.</seg>
<seg xml:lang="en">This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.</seg>
<seg xml:lang="en">Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.</seg>
