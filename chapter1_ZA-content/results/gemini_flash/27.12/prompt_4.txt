PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
____
The House met at 14:00.
House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested
members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or
meditation.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would
like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted
the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of
amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the
sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate
sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’
Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so
that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the
proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming
committee.

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of
Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that
time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two
minutes to three minutes.
With that background, I will now take the first item on the
Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of
the ANC wish to make a statement?
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of
order.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat.
Yes, what’s your point of order?
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the
hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just
look around this House and I think we need to note that there
is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do
ministerial statements but there are not any Ministers in the
House to hear them.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): I’m looking around the
House and I can say that I see a Minister and two Deputy

My apologies. Mama De Lille is there. Let’s hope that as we
continue they will arrive because these are the rules that we
all adopted. Yes, hon Mente?
Ms N V MENTE: House Chair, to say we must proceed ... they
will arrive ... how will they respond to something they did
not hear?
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): We have others that
will respond ... [Inaudible.] ... in the House.
Ms N V MENTE: No, no, no, no, no, no, the rule does not say
that.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): The rule says seven ...
yes, opportunities.
Ms N V MENTE: Yes, they are three now. They are currently
three.

resolve this? We will resolve it together. Let’s resolve it
together.
Ms N V MENTE: Go to the next item on the Order Paper and then
we can come back to statements.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): After having adopted
the rules I have to get advice because I can’t just flout the
rules that we have adopted. Hon Chief Whip?
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Hon House Chairperson, I
want to support the move that ... let’s start with the next
item. However, I must say it is uncalled for that we don’t
have Ministers and Deputy Ministers in the House when they
knew that Statements was going to be the first item. Thank
you. [Applause.]
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Thank you. I think that
is the wish of the members in the House. As the Chief Whip has
spoken and supports what you are saying, and I am advised by
Mr Mahlangu that it is okay, I will proceed that way.

members, as a department we committed ourselves to position
Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic
growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges
facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there
are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to
the challenges of our country.
This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to
harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through
the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT
project has been completed on time and within the budget of
R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include
a 75% local content component and direct investment of more
than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio
Astronomy Observatory alone.
Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to
harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this
regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and
agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and
products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on
agricultural imports.

English:
There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management
of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different
requirements that regulate their operations.
The main reason for this Bill before you today is not to
simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost
containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive
the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives
more decisively.
An important dimension towards the realisation of our
objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions
which regulate the operations of all public entities falling
under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others,
harmonise the processes for the determination of the
remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of
boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the
termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well
as the disqualification of members or potential members from
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 8
the membership of such boards. The Bill also seeks to
harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive
officers, CEOs, of the entities.
The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where
the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of
some of our entities and would thus make provision for
consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such
CEOs.
In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and
affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill
was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in
November 2017.
In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the
nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is
grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.

Mr M P MAPULANE: House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon
members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives
great pleasure to present the committee report and to
participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws
Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.
The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s
Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November
2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub-
rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and
Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill.
The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and
Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019.
However, because the Bill focuses exclusively on the
operational and administrative governance procedures of the
entities that report to the Department of Science and
Innovation, no submissions were received from the public.
The process to consider the amendment proposed by the Science
and Technology Laws Amendment Bill was done in collaboration
with the Parliament’s Legal Services, the Office of the State
Law Advisor and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 10
Evaluation exempted the department from the application of the
socioeconomic impact assessment in respect of the Bill since
it did not directly affect the public.
The department briefed the committee on the Bill on 20
February 2019, two of the committee meetings on 27 and 6 March
were dedicated to the clause by clause consideration and the
adoption of the clause by clause amendments and the
committee’s report on the Bill, which the committee’s report
on the Bill and the allies were published on 11 March 2019.
However, the committee’s report was not considered by the NA
due to the conclusion of the of the Fifth Parliament’s term.
The Bill was subsequently revived by this August House of the
Sixth Parliament last year on 29 October and referred to the
Portfolio Committee on Higher Education Science and
Technology.
Following the briefing by the department on 20 November, the
committee considered the Bill and the amendments effected by
the previous portfolio committee and we are satisfied that the
substance and the processes followed are in order and
therefore are confident that this House can adopt the Science
and Technology Amendment Bill as adopted.
UNREVISED HANSARD

The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment
Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and
operational procedures are applied across the public entities
that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. In
doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and
uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have
their own principle acts. The standardisation of governance
and operational procedures of the public entities that report
to the department allows the department to efficiently manage
its administrative relationship with entities as well as more
effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and
council.
It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in
the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and
ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the
remuneration and allowance of board and council members and
their committees.
The so called harmonisation has started by the department
during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted
in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and
Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and
Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014. The current Science
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 12
and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the
following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of
Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research
Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South
African National Space Agency Act; and the Technology
Innovation Act.
The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the
termination of the membership of the boards or council,
clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons
of membership of council and provide for the appointment of
external persons to committees.
It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and
innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of
the boards and council and their allowance.
The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a
concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as
a network of institutions, organisations and policies that
work together to achieve a common set of social and economic
goals and objectives for the development of science and
technology in our country.
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020

The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and
managing the system of innovation together with the eight
entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996
White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number
of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996
White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new
White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March
2019, the various reviews of the National System of
Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite
significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal
in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet
fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and
Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the
livelihoods of its citizens.
Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the
inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda
sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak
partnership and so forth.
Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and
experimental development survey show that higher education
sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in
the gross expenditure on research and development of
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 14
R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education
sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in
research and development. The research and development in the
business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned
enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is
calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that
is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in
research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.
The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science
sector showed a marginal growth.
Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector
that they need to up their games and increase the investment
in research and development so that the country is able to
attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product,
GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws
Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that
increase in research and development. I thank you
Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective
of the world, especially the living world, inexorably
impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and
structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in
process without ceasing.

The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature
which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the
science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and
governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science
and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction
at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on
discussion and consultation.
Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in
inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of
public entities with different requirements regulating the
operations and governance.
On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for
termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify
the requirements for disqualification of persons from
membership of boards and to provide for the appointment of
external persons to committees of the boards.
Considering the recent flawed processes of public entity
boards as highlighted in the state capture reports, these
amendments are crucial to ensure that the Minister and
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

Page: 16
chairpersons do not have autonomy over the boards and to
ensure that any amendment holds constitutional muster.
The Western Cape government in its submission of the Bill
expressed the importance of fit for purpose when appointed to
the boards, the inclusion of an appeals committee and the
chief executive officer, CEO’s term of office. Clause 22
interpretation of being convicted of fraud, corruption or any
other crime involving dishonesty, within a period of 10 years
preceding the date of nomination can be left open for abuse.
The time period should have been realistically considered.
Also placing the responsibility of determining fit for purpose
in the domain of the court of law is limiting and should have
been added an additional insertion of “or a competent
tribunal”.
The DA was in favour of deleting any clauses that were
contrary to the Public Finance Management Act and the
insertion of the disclosure of conflict of interest clause.
All inputs from various stakeholders were brought into
fruition in this Bill. A lethargic process to ensure enactment
should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament
regarding this Bill.

Mr M N PAULSEN: Hon House Chairperson, the role of science and
technology, in particular research and development is the
industrialisation and betterment of society. Highly
industrialised countries have used science and technology to
drive industry in addressing the country’s challenges.
The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding,
reform and societal status on science and technology as a
fundamental part of the socioeconomic development of the
country as well as for national prestige.
China has made rapid advances in areas such as education,
infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, academic publishing,
patents and commercial applications and is now in some areas
and by some measures a world leader. China is now increasingly
targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining
weaknesses.

Cuba, despite continued sanctions is able to function almost
independently because of the proper use of science and
technology, but more importantly their leadership within
science and technology. We have brother Blade and brother
Buti.
However, let us look at South Africa. Failure by the ruling
party to reconfigure research institutions post1994, has
resulted in these institutions continuing to operate in silos
and playing no role in the reduction of unemployment and
inequality. However also, science and technology is deemed as
elitist with very little accountability to the ruling party.
If it was not elitist, our focus would have been on issues
which affects the poor masses in this country, the provision
of decent water and sanitation, the harnessing of renewable
energy where implementation would be driven by a capable and
capacitated state.
Minister Nzimande spoke of the Square Kilometre Array. Yes, it
is in the Northern Cape, but the global headquarters are in

any intellectual property emanating from the Square Kilometre
Array.

However, I am not surprised by the Minister’s lack of
understanding of things that really matter. The University of
KwaZulu-Natal is burning and there are serious allegations
that a security service provider is responsible for the
problems at the KwaZulu-Natal campuses. It is poor students
who are given the blame and Minister you are here sitting and
speaking about the Square Kilometre Array.
The purpose of this Bill focuses on the need to harmonise the
entities within science and technology, but the Bill and these
institutions are operating within a policy framework that
prioritises research for selfish interest and greed.
Harmonisation was already recommended in the Fourth Parliament
and this House considered the First Amendment Bill in 2011.
In April 2014, the Second Amendment Bill was considered.
Essentially the Second Amendment Bill proposed the
harmonisation of processes which included the appointment of
chairpersons and members of boards of science and technology
entities, the qualifications of board members and the
dissolution of boards.

However, what is laughable is the amendment of section 5 of
Act 26 of 2008. Paragraph 8 says and I quote, “The board must
be constituted in a manner that is broadly representatives of
the demographics of the country.”
South Africa is the only country where the government must
make laws to empower the majority group of its citizens. Black
people. In other countries the government makes laws to
empower minority groups. That is how weak we are as a
democracy and a country.
The current Bill was proposed in the Fifth Parliament, but
Parliament rose before the Bill could be considered. The
current committee constitutes none of the ANC members of the
Fifth Parliament. You have just replaced all of them, no
continuity.
The research and development budget has declined and there has
been a loss of critical scientific skills.
This department does not have a plan to ensure that Industry
4,0 does not lead to greater inequality between the working
class and those who continue to enjoy their historical
advantages.

Although an aspect in the Bill is a step in the right
direction, much more is required before the real benefit of
science and technology will be realised. The EFF rejects this
Bill. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
Mr S L NGCOBO: Hon House Chair, this bill seeks to promote
accountability and transparency of boards and councils
regarding science and technology. We note the many technical
amendments of this Bill in providing sufficient powers to
ensure accountability and transparency in the boards and
councils. The boards and councils oversee the work of various
entities in this department and act as a strategic mechanism
ensuring functionality.
The IFP believes in making amendments that speak to appointing
those who are fit and proper. We are glad to see the board and
the Minister being compelled to engage each other in this
regard as a first step in appointing people who are fit and
proper, through this Amendment Bill. The consultation between
both parties will reduce the potential for an individual to
abuse the power.
In a democracy, checks and balances are important in order to
ensure that the people govern through elected individuals.
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 22
Checks and balances work to promote accountability and
transparency which must be the tool that people use to assess
their levels of satisfaction with government.
The public confidence in this department and some of its
entities is currently low and these amendments seek to redress
the lost confidence. We saw the clear indications of the lack
of confidence during the portfolio committee’s oversight and
presentations made to it.
Public confidence must be built by showing that these entities
are free from corruption, nepotism and patronage. These
entities are seemingly run as if they are just a tuck shop.
Currently, South Africa has been left in the wake of grand
corruption by the former administration. We witness through
many commissions and the Zondo Commission, of a clear lack of
attention paid to checks and balances, accountability and
transparency.
We maintain that only people who show excellence and who are
suitably qualified should be appointed in boards, councils or
official positions. In doing so, we will start to realise a
professionally skilled public service. However, these
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 23
amendments alone won’t ensure the fully skilled public service
that our nation deserves. We must guard against partisan
relationships at board and council levels to ensure that jobs
are given to those who are equal to the tasks required and not
because they are friends of the Ministers or other people. The
IFP supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr W J BOSHOFF: Agb Voorsitter, dit is so dat wetenskap,
tegnologie en innovasie een van daardie dryfkragte agter enige
ekonomie is. In ’n ekonomie waar daar nie aandag aan die drie
aspekte gegee word nie, kom so ’n ekonomie eintlik tot
stilstand. Dit is dus goed dat hierdie en vorige regerings
nogal aandag gegee het aan die totstandkoming van ’n hele
aantal wetenskaplike instellings, waarvan nie almal in hierdie
Ministerie saamgevat is nie, maar wel agt belangrikes. Hierdie
agt het elkeen ’n ander agtergrond soos die RGN, die Raad vir
Geesteswetenskaplike Navorsing, maar ook al die ander, wat op
die menslike aspek van die ekonomie en die samelewing fokus.
Elkeen het op sy eie manier tot stand gekom en daarom is dit
’n goeie idee om ’n bietjie belyning in die organisasie van
hierdie instellings te bring.
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 24
Dit is belangrik dat daar deur hierdie wetsontwerp erken word
dat daar ’n geweldige skaarsheid - en die komitee het die
woord “dearth” [skaarsheid] gebruik - aan vaardighede en
kennis op die terrein van wetenskap, tegnologie en innovasie
is. As ’n mens kan sien dat daar wel so ’n skaarsheid is, dan
is dit eintlik onverstaanbaar dat ’n mens daardie skaarsheid
kunsmatig vergroot deur middel van transformasieteikens en
swart ekonomiese bemagtiging, deur te sê dat soveel persent
van die kundiges uit ’n bepaalde seksie van die demografie
moet kom.
Dit verslaan eintlik die doelwit, want ons het reeds te min
vaardighede. Ons moet elke persoon wat die kennis, die
vaardighede of die ervaring het om in hierdie terrein te dien,
betrek en verwelkom. Ons moet niemand onwelkom laat voel nie.
Daar is baie keer ’n opvatting aan die regterkant van die
Huis, maar partykeer ook aan die ander kant dat, as die VF
Plus homself teen swart ekonomiese bemagtiging as ’n
ekonomiese maatreël uitspreek, dit is asof die VF Plus sê dat
swart mense nie in staat is om die werk te doen nie. Dit is
baie ver van die waarheid af. Dit is nie die kwessie nie. Dit
gaan daaroor dat enige mens, ongeag afkoms, nasionaliteit,
opvoeding, ensovoorts, in ’n posisie gestel word, nie op grond
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 25
van sy vaardighede, kennis of ervaring nie, maar op grond van
’n demografiese profiel.
Verder, as daardie persoon, as gevolg van sy demografiese
profiel, ook nie uit die pos vewyder kan word nie, dan is so
’n persoon geneig om nie juis te presteer nie. Verder, ’n
ander persoon wat wel oor die kennis, vaardighede en ervaring
beskik, maar demografies verkeerd geplaas is, gaan doodgewoon
land uit na waar daar ’n behoefte is aan dit wat hy weet.
Wat meer is, van die talle en talle en talle swart persone wat
in oorvloed oor die kennis, ervaring en vaardighede beskik om
hierdie poste te beklee, is so gesog, want elke
staatsonderneming, elke privaatonderneming en elkeen wat sake
in hierdie land van ons doen, wil daardie mense hê om hul
bemagtigingspunte op te stapel en te kan sê dat hulle aan die
wetlike vereistes voldoen. Dit beteken dat hierdie mense nooit
lank genoeg in een pos bly om die ding werklik onder die knie
te kry en dit tot sy reg te laat kom nie.
As die VF Plus sê dat ons hierdie wetsontwerp ondersteun, maar
dat ons dink dit moes verder gegaan het en ook gesê het dat
swart ekonomiese bemagtigingsteikens uit die terrein van
wetenskap en tegnologie gehaal moet word, dan is dit nie omdat
UNREVISED HANSARD

ons sê dat dit mense is wat nie oor die vaardighede beskik

Suid-Afrika verder te neem.
Mr W M THRING: Hon House Chair, the ACDP is cognisant of the
fact that this Bill which deals with the amendment of the
Scientific Research Council Act of 1988, the Academy of
Science of South Africa Act of 2001, the Human Sciences
Research Council Act of 2008, the Technology Innovation Agency
Act of 2008, and the South African National Space Agency Act
of 2008, essentially seeks to achieve the following: the
harmonisation of the process for the terminisation of the
membership of boards or councils, clarification of the
requirements for the disqualification of persons from
membership of boards or councils, as well as providing for
circumstances where members of boards or councils are
prohibited from participating or voting in the boards or
councils meetings, amongst other things.
Hon House Chair, if South Africa is to meaningfully compete in
the science and technology space, then it must have the
administrative capacity and strength to do so, because any
organisation is only as strong as its internal ability to
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 27
plan, strategise, envision and then implement. There can be no
external growth if the internal capacity or core of an
organisation has rotted or become weak. The ACDP is aware that
this Bill seeks to strengthen the core within the science and
technology sector. It is our view that if this is done
properly, efficiently and transparently, the external knock on
effect of preparing our students to become global players and
contributors to the science and technology space can indeed
become a reality.
We, within the African Christian Democratic Party, believe
that there is no lack of intelligence, ability and potential
among the students of South Africa. To a large extent,
however, there has been a mismatch with respect to the skills
required by industry, and the skills produced within the
education, science and technology sector. This is a recipe for
disaster, and will continue to be a drain on our industrial
and economic recovery, which is so desperately needed.
In conclusion, as this Bill has the noble intention of
harmonising termination processes and, in general,
strengthening the administration processes in the boards and
councils of the relevant entities, the ACDP is cautiously
optimistic that this internal administrative strengthening
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 28
process will have the positive leveraging effect of
strengthening our skills capacity, and thereby unlocking the
enormous potential of our students who will be able to do us
proud in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The ACDP supports
this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]
Mr S N AUGUST: Thank you, House Chair. Good notes the December

I also appreciate the submission received that anyone with a
criminal record must be disqualified. However, from my own
experience working in the justice sector, I know that,
sometimes, criminals are able to be reformed.
The amendment to disqualify any person convicted for fraud,
corruption or any other crime involving dishonesty from being
considered for a board position for at least a decade is
accepted. However, we all know even without a criminal record,
the wrong people can still be appointed. We have seen how
corruption and maladministration results in the waste or theft
of taxpayers’ money. To protect the poor and our country’s

compliance with the Public Finance Management Act and the
Bill’s measures to clamp down on cadre deployment board
appointments by requiring the disclosure of any conflicts of
interests.
Cadre deployment must be stopped. There are many qualified
skilled people with no party affiliation that can do the job.
It is a fact that cadre deployment has destroyed the
independence, and often functionality, of government
institutions. Good welcomes all efforts to stop corruption and
cadre deployment and supports the amendments. Thank you.
Ms J S MANANISO: Chairperson, Deputy President, Ministers,
Deputy Ministers, hon members and fellow South Africans, I
want you to note that during our deliberations members of the
opposition party didn’t have a say. At least they have
consulted and now we know that they are adopting the Bill.
The ANC as the governing party remains committed to our
people’s contract of better life for all. The ANC supports the
Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill. The current
amendments are in response to the gaps identified in the
previous Bill. Furthermore, it deals with codes of ethics and

organisational culture. It has been a practice that most of
the departments with common interest have been working in
silos using minimum resources.
The Bill is about harmonising the six public entities
reporting to the department in working together, collaborating
and sharing best practices. The ANC wants to assure the people
of South Africa that the Bill has went through formal legal
processes. The Bill is technical, administrative and is an
enabling legislation that addresses and promotes the
following: good governance, transparency`, accountability,
professionalism - skill-based, knowledge-based and experience-
based – skills retention, fair representation per
demographics. Most of us normally talk about institutional
memory. Colleagues, here we are not speaking about female and
males, but we are speaking about gender demographics in terms
of religion, sex, age, people with disability, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, pansexual, transgender, gender queer, queer,
intersexes, gender, asexual, and ally, LGBTQIA+, and everybody
who is part of the society.
Hon members, note that when we speak about science, technology
and innovation we don’t speak human disruption, but disruptive
solutions. Understand what I am talking about. Don’t disrupt

This amendment Bill speaks to uniformity and it has clear
terms of references and time frames, which is five periods. It
seeks to strengthen collaborations and intergovernmental
relations and international relations. It is clear in terms of
clarifications of powers and functions between Ministers and
board council members and it speaks about value for money.
The current amendments will ensure that as a developmental
state, our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, play an important
role in growing our economy in addressing societal problems
through scientific research and technological innovation as
recognised by the National Development Plan, NDP.
It has been proven that the following entities work together
in terms of knowledge production and innovation and the
country is able to compete globally in science, technology and
innovation: Academy of Science, Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, Human Sciences Research Council, National
Research Foundation, SA National Space Agency and Technology
Innovation Agency.

The Bill is about redressing and transforming the system as it
is constitutional mandate and we cannot negotiate the plight
of our people. Scientific research and technological
innovation in our life time is an enabling and necessary
platform to fast-track our services to develop and grow South
Africa together. It is important to note that we cannot speak
boldly about economic freedom in our lifetime without
investing in research and development and the advancement of
science, technology and innovation. As we normally say young
minds are innovative minds and investment therein is an
investment into the future.
Hon members, I would like to call on this august House to join
the community of Mohlakeng in the West Rand in celebrating one

Geologist lecturer at the University of Pretoria, ms Mampho

electricity calamity, a calamity brought in by five

It looks like we have no hope of sending a space mission to
the moon. So there is no ambition amongst our brilliant young
scientists to aim for the skies.
We do agree that the Minister must at least be consulted in
the appointed of CEOs in state-owned entities, SOEs, so that
he can take the blame if they mess up as it has happened over
the past five parliaments. The Sixth Parliament must not be in
the same boat.
Science and technology opportunities, especially at the most
senior levels, should have no racial discrimination. For once
I agree with the hon members of the FF Plus. It is very
important that South Africa takes advantage of the brilliance

The DA supports the need to harmonise the provisions which
regulate the operations and governance of the science and
innovation public entities through the Amendment Bill in order
to strengthen accountability and enhance consistency.
It must be made clear that the DA in Parliament and the DA-led
Western Cape government have been heavily involved in the
process of strengthening this legislation because we believe
that South Africa has neglected the importance of matching its
policy commitment to improved education and skills with a
dedicated focus on innovation and design to drive job creating
economic growth.
UNREVISED HANSARD

TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020

The institutions created to promote innovation for growth have
not been appropriately co-ordinated, funded or integrated with
initiatives in the private sector.
To be a winning nation, South Africa must also be a place
where new ideas are generated. This includes ideas to improve
the way we deliver services, ideas to connect people to each
other and with the information they need to make informed
decisions about their lives. It should include ideas for new
products that can generate income, ideas to improve the
efficiency of processes in both the public and private sector;
and ideas to solve our key societal challenges, for example in
education, health, housing, social protection and job
creation.
However, in order for us to do this effectively as a
collective, we have to have a clear definition of what science
and innovation means to us as South Africans and what role it
should serve in advancing socioeconomic development. Let us
not forget, in the past, the science narrative was shaped by a
few, leaving the majority behind.
This narrative is now changing and it is at this juncture that
we must be very intentional in how we shape the conversations
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 37
around science and innovation because they influence the kind
of initiatives we take on to improve the quality of our lives.
If we do not make a concerted effort to define this narrative,
we run the risk of taking on science and innovation
initiatives that don’t address South Africa’s triple challenge
of poverty, inequality and unemployment.
We will look back and ask ourselves, what good did it yield to
shout on roof tops Fourth Industrial Revolution and yet, the
inequality gaps are still wide and the basic fundamentals are
still burning issues hindering the progress of underdeveloped
communities? [Applause.]
Therefore, there must be a coordinated effort to develop a
value chain that will see science and innovation as an enabler
of socioeconomic prosperity rather than a by-the-way elitist
space.
ANC Ministers who are out of touch with the harsh realities of
our people continually insist on building smart cities,
providing tablets to school learners, developing data and
artificial intelligence policy’s for big business and
entrepreneurs. And yet, the reality is, majority of public

schools, especially in our rural and township communities, do
not have fully functional and equipped science labs, a key
component that gives a child the opportunity to practicalise
science. [Applause.]
Time and time again, we have heard sweeping statements made
about bullet-trains and creating smart cities and yet we sit
with an energy and water crisis in our rural and peri-urban
communities.
We are talking about developing data and artificial
intelligence policies and yet we know all too well that for
our scientists, engineers, technopreneurs and student
entrepreneurs, the lack of funding remains a stumbling block
that hinders research solutions being translated to impactful
technology. We also know that access to market for our Small,
Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises, SMMEs, thereafter is
always a problem and yet the ANC-led government does not make
enough noise on these key issues.
If we are truly serious about creating a National System of
Innovation, NSI, that is inclusive and advances socioeconomic
development, we to have to find way of extending the
conversation beyond ourselves. The inability for us to
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 39
understand the real issues on the ground, on a much deeper
level, will have us shooting in the dark and adopting
technologies and systems that are not fit for context and will
only widen the gap between insiders and outsiders.
Therefore, the DA proposes the following in line with our
innovation policy: Science needs to serve us by using it for
problem-solving our societal problems such as education,
skills development, safety, service delivery, National Student
Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS, which is a failing entity with
their Information and Communications Technology, ICT, there’s
a huge certification backlog where students can’t get their
certificates, student housing and community development.
We, however, commend the good work done by the Department of
Science And Innovation even with their stringent budget;
however, we do believe that the merger of the Department of
Higher Education, Science and Innovation can use science as a
tool to solve societal problems rather than to be seen as
elitist spares.
The boy who harnessed the wind is a true reflection of how we
can contextualise science and channel it for the purpose of

Ms N T MKHATSHWA: Hon Chairperson, hon deputy president, hon

As we enter into this new decode, we must emphasize the role
of science and innovation in our society.
From 4 to 7 February 2020, the Portfolio Committee on Higher
Education, Science and Technology visited the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, CSIR, in Pretoria. This
was the first visit conducted by the committee to the CSIR.
The thirst of members to see in reality the research,
development and innovation projects that the deportment and
its entities report on in Parliament, has finally, to some
extent, been quenched.
UNREVISED HANSARD

I am tempted to say that every single member of this portfolio
committee was excited by the work being done by the CSIR. And
perhaps those that failed to see how young people are being
included in the projects that are taking place in science may
join us on our next oversight visit, hon Chairperson of the
committee.
Hon members, at the CSIR we witnessed research, development
and innovation that is aligned to the objective of having
science and innovation that contributes to on improved quality
of life for all communities in South Africa.
At the CSIR we viewed Umbiflow. The Umbiflow is a low-cost
ultrasound device used to assess fetus health. The Umbiflow
empowers nursing sisters, midwives and general practitioners
in mobile, rural and low-resourced primary health core
settings. It has gone beyond our borders to be further studied
in Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana and India. Such innovations assist
communities in ensuring successful births and therefore,
reducing infant mortality.
We also viewed the Biomanufacturing Industry Support
Initiative, BIDC, which provides technical product and process
development support to Small, Medium and Micro-sized
UNREVISED HANSARD

Enterprises with the aim of creating and expanding
biomanufacturing activity and associated job creation. Many of
the products that have been supported by the BIDC derive from
Indigenous Knowledge Systems. As I share this with members, I
cannot help but say, this is a good story to tell.
Hon members, these are but a few initiatives in only one of
the eight entities of the deportment. So, you can only imagine
the many other good projects that are taking place across all
the other entities. Notwithstanding, of course, the challenges
present. And yes, we could choose to succumb to the many
difficult protracted problems that confront us, or we can
choose to confront them with resolve, determination and
action; as said by the President.
These research, development and innovation projects are
testament to our aims as a government to increase the
wellbeing and prosperity of society through science,
technology and innovation. Science and innovation remains a
pivotal port of our democracy and requires a long term
dedicated support.
This one is for you, hon Boshoff.

increase of women in the entire composition of the department
and its entities.
The President calls on young people and students to lead the
skills revolution, and to be the champions of innovation.
Therefore, we must ensure increased inclusion of young people
from all ends of our country. It must never be that those that
are located in institutions with geographic proximity to the
campuses of entities be the only ones who gain the most
opportunities. The entities must be accessible to, in
particular those historically marginalized from such
opportunities, hon Boshoff.
We must continue to work at strengthening our strategies to

meet its obligation to citizens in the areas of economic
growth, job creation, social programmes and dealing with crime

that we start with it before the motions and finish this part
as per my discretion. Hon Dhlomo, it is your time to introduce
the Report.
Dr S M DHLOMO: Hon Chair, the National Public Health
Institutes of South Africa Bill, NAPHISA, was processed in
both Houses in the 5th Parliament. It went through the process
of revival in this House hence we are tabling it for
consideration.
In 1994, the democratic government began a process of
transforming the deep-rooted dysfunctional public health
system which manifested itself in the collusion of epidemics
of communicable and non-communicable diseases in South Africa.
The public health system has and continues to correct the
colonial policies of subjugation and apartheid disposition
which both determine inferior health care services to the
majority of the South Africans.
To this end, this Bill is imperative because it is a step
towards refinement of the public health system for the people
of South Africa. The aim of the NAPHISA Bill is to provide
integrated and co-ordinated diseases and injury surveillance
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 53
research, monitoring and evaluation of services and
interventions directed towards the major public health
problems affecting the South African population.
The International Association of National Public Health
Institutes serves as a strong advocate for countries to have a
unified credible, legal structure such as NAPHISA to improve
the protection of public health through collaboration,
research and surveillance of various diseases, as we face the
quadruple burden of disease in our country.
Accordingly, the NAPHISA BILL is envisaged to enhance health
systems effectiveness by performing some of the following
functions.
a. Co-ordinate, develop and maintain surveillance systems to
collect, analyse and interpret health data to guide
health interventions.
b. Strengthen capacity in public and occupational health
surveillance in order to reduce the burden of disease and
injury.
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 54
c. Use surveillance data and other sources of information
where appropriate to advice on the setting of health
policies priorities and planning.
d. Strengthen the cross-border regional and international
collaboration on cancer surveillance, occupational
health, non-communicable diseases, injuries and violence.
e. Use public health information for monitoring and
evaluation policy interventions.
f. Strengthen advocacy, social mobilisation and partnerships
in order to address all the other quadruple burden of
disease I have mentioned above.
The NAPHISA Bill recognises that South Africa does not have an
integrated surveillance system, but different institutions
that deal with different aspects of surveillance which leads
to duplication, fragmentation, inefficiency and wastage of
scares resources.
In correcting this challenge, the Bill states that NAPHISA
will comprise of all the following divisions. Cancer
surveillance, occupational health, environmental health,
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 55
communicable diseases, non-communicable disease, injury and
violence prevention.
The clustering of these divisions will make NAPHISA a national
strategic entity that is remarried on safeguarding the public
health system for our country.
The National Development Plan, NDP, together with the World
Health Organisation, WHO, underscores the importance of
efficient strengthening and co-ordinated national health
systems for prevention of illnesses and realisation of health
outcomes. Furthermore, the International Association of
National Public Health Institutes attributes better health
outcomes for our countries that form national public health
institutes and urge for countries to do the same.
Some of the countries that have established national public
institutions include Brazil, Finland, while others formed
theirs more recently. Some of the national public institutes
were formed in responses to public health challenges that
highlighted the need for specific capacity leadership and co-
ordination such as public health urgency of Canada which was
formed following the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome,

SARS, outbreak. Others resulted from restructuring of public
care services such as the United Kingdom and China.
The Bill is resuscitated from the 5th Parliament as I have
mentioned where there was a consultation with social cluster
departments namely, social development, education, women,
children and people with disabilities.
In conclusion, it is noted that since the outbreak novel of
corona virus from China in December 2019, South Africa has not
had any confirmed cases. Accordingly, this Bill has come at an
opportune time for it to be processed as we may face global
epidemiology of diseases, mitral valve, aorta, skeleton, and
skin, Mass, Sars, Ebola, Listeriosis and novel Coronavirus,
which all have devastating socio impact in the country. The
committee is bringing the NAPHISA Bill to the House for

is underfunded, understaffed and unable to deal with the
workload or to ensure that those who have legitimate claims
are compensated.
There is no mention of the role to be played by the Medical
Research Council, Centre of Communicable Bill diseases or the
Office of Health Standards Compliance, OHSC. They are already
well established entities who have a great track record of
research, monitoring and dealing with communicable diseases.
They need to be included in an appeaseable. We must include
them in all of our negotiations.
Finally, the scope of health professionals is vast. There are
nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, psychologists, dentists,
ophalmics, scientists, allied workers to name just a few. How
will every type of health professional be represented on the
board or in these units.
We supported the Bill from the outset and we will continue to
do so but, be assured we will monitor the establishment of
NAPHISA very carefully. There are a lot of unanswered

The Bill will not be a solution for the water crisis
experienced in hospitals in Hammanskraal, Thohoyandou, QwaQwa,

This Bill will not have us wake up with improved security
systems to protect our medication that is stolen from our

This Bill will also not be able to stop your health care

The EFF condemns the department, the Minister of Health and

prioritise primary health care, prevention, education on
health care, building of clinics in each ward and all the
aspects as per the aspirations of the Bill which don’t even
need the structure to be established for these things to be
done.
This Bill is merely stealing time from our people, and in

Ms M D HLENGWA: Hon House Chairperson, the ... [Inaudible.]
service delivery and accountability for public health
resources are essential in the public health services of this
country. In South Africa where we have unequal resources
distribution, poverty and inequality this becomes even more
necessary and urgent.
Public health care is essential but what we are witnessing in
South Africa is a public health care service which is itself
on life support. The SA Health Products Regulatory Authority,
Sahpra, is for all intents and purposes becoming hostile
towards our own doctors who have trained and qualified as
medical professionals abroad, instead of finding solutions to
fast-track and place these health care professionals in our
hospitals, Sahpra is building barriers which prevent and
frustrate their entry to practise in South Africa. Why is the
Minister not intervening in this crisis?
What we have been witnessing over the last 25 years in South
Africa is the gradual erosion of our public service. We spend
billions on health care and yet this country still suffers
from a high burden of preventable illness and premature death.

South Africa is currently affected by what is being termed the

This government has fallen short of its own promises as

exactly that.
Attention should and must be given to the concerns of Cancer
Association of South Africa, Cansa, about the cancer registry.
We all know that this registry was out of date and of limited
use, so we hope that this problem will receive attention.
The FF Plus has a few concerns with this Bill which is the
following; firstly, the institute must not become another
state entity as stated under section 2 of this Bill; secondly,
the power vested on the Minister to appoint members of the
board as stipulated in section 5 of the Bill is a bit
problematic as we believe that these powers must not be vested
in one person alone but in a broader base of stakeholders.
The question must be asked if there will be any money
available in the health budget after tomorrow’s Budget Speech
to get this institute running and begin its work. This
Portfolio Committee on Health or this Sixth Parliament must
monitor the Department of Health regarding the implementation
of this institution. Therefore, time will tell if this
institute will be a success or not. Thank you, House

Declarations of vote contd.
Ms M E SUKERS: Hon Chairperson, the ACDP recognises the
critical importance of legislation that would serve to enhance
the health and wellbeing of our nation, given the current
challenges we face locally, as well as globally, and the
impact of these challenges on our economy.
It is stated that the role of a National Health Institute is
to provide leadership and directions to programmes that are
designed to improve health and to support research in among
other things, understanding of mental addictive and physical
disorders. There is a critical need for an entity such as the
National Institute for Injury and Violence Prevention that
forms part of NAFISA. As such, we wish to highlight the
following.
The ACDP wishes to highlight the critical need for us to
research and focus on mental health as a contributor to
violence crimes against the most vulnerable people in our
society – our women and children. The Minister of Social
Development, Lindiwe Zulu, during our discussion on gender-
based violence, GBV, said the following, and I quote, “We must
get inside the heads of these people who commit such crimes.”
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 66
Reportedly, a staggering 1 000 children are murdered annually
in Cape Town alone. Our communities are suffering under
violence. It is as such that the ACDP supports this
legislation. We are asking that there needs to be critical
research into psychiatric disorders and the significant impact
that it has on our communities. We need to research
effectively what will stop these violent crimes from being
perpetrated upon our children.
It has been reported that the man that is responsible for the
death of Tasne Van Wyk was kept in his house because his
family feared what he would do to children. We have to ask
them. We need to then emphasise how important it is for the
prevention of violence against women and children - that
research be conducted. The ACDP supports this legislation.
Mr A M SHAIK-EMAM: Hon House Chair, at the very outset, please
allow me to tell you that the NFP supports the Bill tabled
here today. Let me start of by saying that I just want to
respond to the member from the EFF. She is correct when she
says that this Bill is not going to give you more doctors, but
if implemented, it simply means that you will not need as many
doctors as you need today. [Applause.] [Laughter.]
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 67
She is correct when she says it is not going to give you
medicine, but if implemented, there will be a need for less
medicine than we have at the moment. The reason for that is –
she goes on to say – that there is no research. If you read
the amendment to the Bill, it clearly talks about training and
research, if necessary, in order to address challenges in the
health sector.
So, the purpose of this is – let me give you a good example
and I hope that the department is taking cognisance of this:
This particular province has the highest incidents of
diabetes. We know the challenges of cancer we face in the
country. I had the opportunity of sitting next to somebody on
the plane recently and everyone in this House knows who she is
but I won’t mention her name. Her research shows that even
Sunlight liquid soap is one of the root causes of cancer.
So, this Bill can address these issues in terms of its
research to prevent people from picking up illnesses like
cancer and diabetes – the effects of Coca Cola and everything
else! I think we must welcome this initiative. This started
previously with the former Minister of Health. He came and
gave a detailed briefing to the committee. Let me also add
that even the members of the EFF were there, supported it and
UNREVISED HANSARD
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020
Page: 68
made input in that committee – the Portfolio Committee on
Health.
So, let us not come here and run everything down. When there
is a good initiative which is going to benefit our people, let
us support it. Equally, if there is a problem, we can address
that too. However, if you run down everything – let me tell
you that the emphasis here is on prevention, to be able to
identify certain diseases and other things before they get out
of hand. I think it is a commendable thing.
Yes, there are going to be implications in terms of cots, but
then we have to measure the value of the money that you are
spending and what returns we are getting. If you save a
hundred lives and spend R1 0000000, then you equate that, you
basically saved R100 000000 in the country. So, yes indeed,
the NFP will support this amendment. Thank you. [Applause.]
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Again, I will ask: Are
there any objections to this amending Bill being passed?

didn’t deny me my first opportunity at this podium.
[Applause.]
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): That means it is his
maiden speech. We know the Rules about that.
Mr K L JACOBS: Chair, access to health care became a basic
human right in the democratic South Africa, with a right to
health care services being provided for in three sections of
the Constitution of South Africa. Section 27 of the
Constitution of South Africa provides that every person has a
right to have access to health care services and further
places the state as a central role player in ensuring that it
takes reasonable legislative and other measures within its
available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of
these rights.
The National Development Plan, NDP, envisions a health system
that works for everyone and produces positive health outcomes.
Goal 6 of the NDP addresses the need for a complete reform in
health systems through integrating the different parts of the
health system. The NDP also emphasises the need for the
development of an information system for managing diseases – a

function which National Public Health Institute of SA,
Naphisa, will fulfil through its integrated and co-ordinated
disease and injury surveillance.
The National Public Health Institute of South Africa Bill
before us speaks to the establishment of a single national
public entity. For the co-ordination of public health services
to ensure that such services are evidence based through its
research, surveillance, training, monitoring and evaluation.
To hon Chirwa, I want to say the following: The Bill is not
intended to provide clinical services. Please go and read the
Bill and you will find that it is for the establishment of an
expert national body to the further improvement of the health
of the people of South Africa, responding to the major health
problems affecting our people. It will monitor the welfare and
health of the population on silly factors which could cause
harm and develop and promote measures to improve the
situation.
We are reminded of the leadership and support that South
Africa provided to Sierra Leon as some of the first responders
in January 2015 with the outbreak of Ebola. There, south
Africa showed that it is at the forefront and a leader in the

health care system of the world, and contributing to health in
the entire world. This institute will provide a national
capacity to drive evidence-informed preventive health policy
and programmes, as well as providing evidence on the social
determinants of health. The research should generate new
knowledge; make it easier to absorb innovations from
international science network; and the application of such
knowledge for new development.
I wish to say to the FF-Plus, the ANC will also make certain
that it is not just another state entity. In fact, if you look
at the definition of this entity, then it will say that
national Parliament thus will have oversight over this entity.
So, this puts at rest those points which he raised. As the
ANC, we remain committed to the promotion of health through
preventive measures.
The establishment of National Public Health Institute of SA
will be one such method towards achieving the intended health
goals and objective of the country. In conclusion thus, the
ANC supports the National Public Health Institute of South
Africa Bill as well as the committee report on the above
subject matter. Thank you. [Applause.]

the conditions on which Tazne’s killer was granted parole and
how was he being monitored by his department. It’s clear that

The ANC-led government is indeed incapable of creating an
economic environment that is conducive for job creation. This
affirms that young people still find themselves fighting for
their dignity, livelihoods and survival. The facts speaks for
themselves because 8,2 million of South Africa’s 20,4 million
young South Africans are without jobs. There is however one
place that is giving young people hope; that things can be
better and that is the DA-led Western Cape government.
[Applause.] It has created 24 000 jobs in the last quarter and
maintained the lowest unemployment rate in the country.
Therefore, the DA calls for this House to congratulate the
Western Cape for creating job opportunities for the many young
people in these devastating economic times. I thank you.

SOUTH AFRICA’S LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS

Mr L M NTSHAYISA (AIC): Hon House Chairperson, the Transport

Association that South Africa still lacks both the electronic

which all have been made compulsory to be fitted as standard

In countries such as ours where car accidents claim innocent
lives almost on a daily basis, these recent revelations have
come as a great shock to us. Can these departments assure
South African motorists that their vehicles are risk averse

thank you very much hon Seabi for observing a very important

languages in major universities like Wits University,
University of Cape Town, University of Johannesburg, and so
on.
Firstly, we do this because it is quite important to emphasise
the importance of mother tongue because our erstwhile
colonisers couldn’t annihilate our languages, so we should

continue to preserve them for posterity. Secondly, in Makhanda
area, we have taken a decision to change the National English
Literary Museum to be Amazwi South African Museum of
Literature so that it doesn’t only develop English, but it
also develops IsiXhosa in the Makhanda area.
The last point is a call to our compatriots - especially white
compatriots, to start learning African languages, especially
basics, as it will augur well for social cohesion. We need to
do that. We had a young lady there from Italy who was learning
African languages - IsiZulu and IsiXhosa. If foreigners can do
that, surely, South Africans can. Thank you very much.

reminded us that one of the biggest challenges we have in
South Africa is about us pointing fingers to each other when
we are supposed to deal with a very serious matter. The issue
of violence against women and children is not a matter to
politicise about; it is a matter for us to make commitment

across party political lines. It is a matter that we need to
be able to commit house to house, street to street, and family
to family, in order for us to be able to deal with it.
This is a matter that I would also like to say that the
Minister of Police, the Minister of Justice, including the
President himself, today are going to the field to visit the
families of those that have been affected. The plea from me
and the Minister of Social Development, and also from the
branches of the ANC is that we should commit to working in our
communities because this is a societal problem. It is a
societal problem that we live with. Some people see it
happening on a day-to-day basis, and they don’t lift a finger.
So, this is not an issue for us to really make jokes about it,
it is a matter that we all need to commit to do, and act in
the best way we can. I thank you.
