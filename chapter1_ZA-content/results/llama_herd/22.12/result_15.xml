<UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 1>
<TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 ____ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ____>
The House met at 14:00.
House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.

<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements.

To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes.

With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION:</note>
Sorry Chair, on a point of order.

<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION:</note>
I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for raising a point of order.

<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
What is it, hon member?

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION:</note>
I just wanted to say that we are not opposed to the Bill. We will support it.

<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
Thank you, hon member. The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology is present in the House.

<note type="speaker">The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:</note>
Thank you very much, House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development.

Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs.

For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

<note type="speaker">The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):</note>
Thank you, Minister.

<seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</seg>

**REASON FOR THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY**

<seg xml:lang="en">The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.</seg>

**HARMONISING STATUTORY PROVISIONS**

<seg xml:lang="en">An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry.</seg>

**OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL**

<seg xml:lang="en">This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils.</seg>

**TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP AND DISQUALIFICATION**

<seg xml:lang="en">The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 8 the membership of such boards.</seg>

**APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**

<seg xml:lang="en">The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities.</seg>

**CORRECTING ANOMALIES**

<seg xml:lang="en">The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs.</seg>

**CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS**

<seg xml:lang="en">In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017.</seg>

**ISIZULU TRANSLATION**

<seg xml:lang="is">Sethemba ukuthi amalungu ahloniphekile aleNdlu azoweseka awuphasise loMthethosivivinyo ukuze siqubeke nalo msebenzi omuhle esiwenzayo wokusebenzisa ubuchwepheshe ukuze senze izimpilo zabantu bakithi zibe ngcono.</seg>

**VOICE IN APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**

<seg xml:lang="en">It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees.</seg>

**HARMONISATION OF REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES**

<seg xml:lang="en">The so called harmonisation has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014.</seg>

**CURRENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL**

<seg xml:lang="en">The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are:</seg>

**The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.

**THEIR ALLOWANCE.**

**The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.**

**UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14**

**The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.**

**Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth. Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.**

**The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth. Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.**

**We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development. I thank you Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of change. Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress.**

**I thank you. [Applause.] Mr M N PAULSEN: Hon House Chairperson, the role of science and technology, in particular research and development is the industrialisation and betterment of society. Highly industrialised countries have used science and technology to drive industry in addressing the country’s challenges. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socioeconomic development of the country as well as for national prestige.**

**China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, academic publishing, patents and commercial applications and is now in some areas and by some measures a world leader. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. Cuba, despite continued sanctions is able to function into the same xml format.**

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.

almost independently because of the proper use of science and technology, but more importantly their leadership within science and technology. We have brother Blade and brother Buti. However, let us look at South Africa. Failure by the ruling party to reconfigure research institutions post1994, has resulted in these institutions continuing to operate in silos and playing no role in the reduction of unemployment and inequality. However also, science and technology is deemed as elitist with very little accountability to the ruling party. If it was not elitist, our focus would have been on issues which affects the poor masses in this country, the provision of decent water and sanitation, the harnessing of renewable energy where implementation would be driven by a capable and capacitated state. Minister Nzimande spoke of the Square Kilometre Array. Yes, it is in the Northern Cape, but the global headquarters are in the UK. These headquarters will ultimately be the owners of any intellectual property emanating from the Square Kilometre Array.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** However, I am not surprised by the Minister’s lack of understanding of things that really matter. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is burning and there are serious allegations that a security service provider is responsible for the problems at the KwaZulu-Natal campuses. It is poor students who are given the blame and Minister you are here sitting and speaking about the Square Kilometre Array.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** The purpose of this Bill focuses on the need to harmonise the entities within science and technology, but the Bill and these institutions are operating within a policy framework that prioritises research for selfish interest and greed. Harmonisation was already recommended in the Fourth Parliament and this House considered the First Amendment Bill in 2011. In April 2014, the Second Amendment Bill was considered. Essentially the Second Amendment Bill proposed the harmonisation of processes which included the appointment of chairpersons and members of boards of science and technology entities, the qualifications of board members and the dissolution of boards.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** However, what is laughable is the amendment of section 5 of Act 26 of 2008. Paragraph 8 says and I quote, “The board must be constituted in a manner that is broadly representatives of the demographics of the country.” South Africa is the only country where the government must make laws to empower the majority group of its citizens. Black people. In other countries the government makes laws to empower minority groups. That is how weak we are as a democracy and a country.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** The current Bill was proposed in the Fifth Parliament, but Parliament rose before the Bill could be considered. The current committee constitutes none of the ANC members. We maintain that only people who show excellence and who are suitably qualified should be appointed in boards, councils or official positions.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** In doing so, we will start to realise a professionally skilled public service. However, these amendments alone won’t ensure the fully skilled public service that our nation deserves. We must guard against partisan relationships at board and council levels to ensure that jobs are given to those who are equal to the tasks required and not because they are friends of the Ministers or other people.

**THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:** The IFP supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dit is belangrik dat daar deur hierdie wetsontwerp erken word dat daar ’n geweldige skaarsheid - en die komitee het die woord “dearth” [skaarsheid] gebruik - aan vaardighede en kennis op die terrein van wetenskap, tegnologie en innovasie is. As ’n mens kan sien dat daar wel so ’n skaarsheid is, dan is dit eintlik onverstaanbaar dat ’n mens daardie skaarsheid kunsmatig vergroot deur middel van transformasieteikens en swart ekonomiese bemagtiging, deur te sê dat soveel persent van die kundiges uit ’n bepaalde seksie van die demografie moet kom. Dit verslaan eintlik die doelwit, want ons het reeds te min vaardighede. Ons moet elke persoon wat die kennis, die vaardighede of die ervaring het om in hierdie terrein te werk, erken en ondersteun.

Mr W M THRING:
Hon House Chair, the ACDP is cognisant of the fact that this Bill which deals with the amendment of the Scientific Research Council Act of 1988, the Academy of Science of South Africa Act of 2001, the Human Sciences Research Council Act of 2008, the Technology Innovation Agency Act of 2008, and the South African National Space Agency Act of 2008, essentially seeks to achieve the following: the harmonisation of the process for the terminisation of the membership of boards or councils, clarification of the requirements for the disqualification of persons from membership of boards or councils, as well as providing for circumstances where members of boards or councils are prohibited from participating or voting in the boards or councils meetings, amongst other things.

Hon House Chair, if South Africa is to meaningfully compete in the science and technology space, then it must have the administrative capacity and strength to do so, because any organisation is only as strong as its internal ability to plan, strategise, envision and then implement. There can be no external growth if the internal capacity or core of an organisation has rotted or become weak. The ACDP is aware that this Bill seeks to strengthen the core within the science and technology sector.

It is our view that if this is done properly, efficiently and transparently, the external knock on effect of preparing our students to become global players and contributors to the science and technology space can indeed become a reality. We, within the African Christian Democratic Party, believe that there is no lack of intelligence, ability and potential among the students of South Africa. To a large extent, however, there has been a mismatch with respect to the skills required by industry, and the skills produced within the education, science and technology sector.

This is a recipe for disaster, and will continue to be a drain on our industrial and economic recovery, which is so desperately needed. In conclusion, as this Bill has the noble intention of harmonising termination processes and, in general, strengthening the administration processes in the boards and councils of the relevant entities, the ACDP is cautiously optimistic that this internal administrative strengthening will indeed have a positive impact on our science and technology sector.

process will have the positive leveraging effect of strengthening our skills capacity, and thereby unlocking the enormous potential of our students who will be able to do us proud in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The ACDP supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

<note type="speaker">Mr S N AUGUST:</note>
<who="#SNAugust">
Thank you, House Chair. Good notes the December 2019 recommendations from the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology that the National Assembly passes the Bill. We thank the multiparty committee for their work and welcome the amendments that aim to ensure that all public entities comply with the Public Finance Management Act. I also appreciate the submission received that anyone with a criminal record must be disqualified. However, from my own experience working in the justice sector, I know that, sometimes, criminals are able to be reformed. The amendment to disqualify any person convicted for fraud, corruption or any other crime involving dishonesty from being considered for a board position for at least a decade is accepted. However, we all know even without a criminal record, the wrong people can still be appointed. We have seen how corruption and maladministration results in the waste or theft of taxpayers’ money. To protect the poor and our country’s UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 29 finances, Good welcomes the stronger measures to ensure compliance with the Public Finance Management Act and the Bill’s measures to clamp down on cadre deployment board appointments by requiring the disclosure of any conflicts of interests. Cadre deployment must be stopped. There are many qualified skilled people with no party affiliation that can do the job. It is a fact that cadre deployment has destroyed the independence, and often functionality, of government institutions. Good welcomes all efforts to stop corruption and cadre deployment and supports the amendments. Thank you.

Chairperson, Deputy President, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, hon members and fellow South Africans, I want you to note that during our deliberations members of the opposition party didn’t have a say. At least they have consulted and now we know that they are adopting the Bill. The ANC as the governing party remains committed to our people’s contract of better life for all. The ANC supports the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill. The current amendments are in response to the gaps identified in the previous Bill. Furthermore, it deals with codes of ethics and UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 30 organisational culture. It has been a practice that most of the departments with common interest have been working in silos using minimum resources. The Bill is about harmonising the six public entities reporting to the department in order to improve coordination and collaboration. The Bill is also about redressing and transforming the system as it is constitutional mandate and we cannot negotiate the plight of our people.

Scientific research and technological innovation in our life time is an enabling and necessary platform to fast-track our services to develop and grow South Africa together. It is important to note that we cannot speak boldly about economic freedom in our lifetime without investing in research and development and the advancement of science, technology and innovation.

<note type="speaker">Mr M G E HENDRICKS:</note>
Hon Chair, thank you very much for the opportunity. It was very encouraging to listen to the Minister saying that the amendments are catalyst for economic growth. And I am very excited about the opportunities that the Minister highlighted for smart agriculture, and also that he is very keen that his Ministry will now drive the skills knowledge that we need.

**Page: 37**

However, investment in research and innovation is still a Cinderella when it comes to building a modern South Africa for UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 34 the 21st and 22nd centuries. All we seem to have is just a telescope. Our nuclear know how before apartheid has not been harnessed. It could have assisted us today with our electricity calamity, a calamity brought in by five parliaments. It looks like we have no hope of sending a space mission to the moon. So there is no ambition amongst our brilliant young scientists to aim for the skies.

**Page: 38**

We do agree that the Minister must at least be consulted in the appointed of CEOs in state-owned entities, SOEs, so that he can take the blame if they mess up as it has happened over the past five parliaments. The Sixth Parliament must not be in the same boat. Science and technology opportunities, especially at the most senior levels, should have no racial discrimination.

**Page: 39**

For once I agree with the hon members of the FF Plus. It is very important that South Africa takes advantage of the brilliance and the innovation of its citizens and no one should be left out to take South Africa to the 21st and 22nd centuries.

Al Jama’ah supports amendments to the Bill.

**Page: 41**

<note type="speaker">The DA:</note>
The DA supports the need to harmonise the provisions which regulate the operations and governance of the science and innovation public entities through the Amendment Bill in order to strengthen accountability and enhance consistency. It must be made clear that the DA in Parliament and the DA-led Western Cape government have been heavily involved in the process of strengthening this legislation because we believe that South Africa has neglected the importance of matching its policy commitment to improved education and skills with a dedicated focus on innovation and design to drive economic growth.

**Page: 42**

Therefore, there must be a coordinated effort to develop a value chain that will see science and innovation as an enabler of socioeconomic prosperity rather than a by-the-way elitist space. ANC Ministers who are out of touch with the harsh realities of our people continually insist on building smart cities, providing tablets to school learners, developing data and artificial intelligence policy’s for big business and entrepreneurs.

**Page: 43**

And yet, the reality is, majority of public schools, especially in our rural and township communities, do not have fully functional and equipped science labs, a key component that gives a child the opportunity to practicalise science. [Applause.] Time and time again, we have heard sweeping statements made about bullet-trains and creating smart cities and yet we sit with an energy and water crisis in our rural and peri-urban communities.

We are talking about developing data and artificial intelligence policies and yet we know all too well that for our scientists, engineers, technopreneurs and student entrepreneurs, the lack of funding into research and innovation is a major hindrance to their ability to innovate and create jobs. [Applause.]

Therefore, we must ensure that science and innovation are prioritised in our country’s development agenda, particularly in rural and township communities where they are most needed. We must also ensure that the benefits of science and innovation are shared equitably among all South Africans.

In conclusion, I urge this House to support the amendments to the Bill as it will help to strengthen accountability and enhance consistency in the governance of science and innovation public entities. It is a step in the right direction towards building a modern South Africa that is driven by science and innovation.

**Remains a stumbling block that hinders research solutions being translated to impactful technology. We also know that access to market for our Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises, SMMEs, thereafter is always a problem and yet the ANC-led government does not make enough noise on these key issues. If we are truly serious about creating a National System of Innovation, NSI, that is inclusive and advances socioeconomic development, we have to find way of extending the conversation beyond ourselves. The inability for us to understand the real issues on the ground, on a much deeper level, will have us shooting in the dark and adopting technologies and systems that are not fit for context and will only widen the gap between insiders and outsiders. Therefore, the DA proposes the following in line with our innovation policy:**

**Science needs to serve us by using it for problem-solving our societal problems such as education, skills development, safety, service delivery, National Student Financial Aid Scheme, NSFAS, which is a failing entity with their Information and Communications Technology, ICT, there’s a huge certification backlog where students can’t get their certificates, student housing and community development. We, however, commend the good work done by the Department of Science And Innovation even with their stringent budget; however, we do believe that the merger of the Department of Higher Education, Science and Innovation can use science as a tool to solve societal problems rather than to be seen as elitist spares. The boy who harnessed the wind is a true reflection of how we can contextualise science and channel it for the purpose of socioeconomic development. I thank you so much. [Applause.]**

**<who="#HouseChairperson">Hon Ntshayisa, I just want to inform you, this is a debate and if you don’t speak before the official opposition, in as far as our conversions are set, you cannot speak now. So, I’m sorry, you were not in the House and we proceeded.</who>**

**<note type="speaker">Ms N T MKHATSHWA:</note>**
**<who="#Mkhatswa">Hon Chairperson, hon deputy president, hon members of the House, and to the many of South Africans watching from home. As we enter into this new decode, we must emphasize the role of science and innovation in our society.</seg>,**

**From 4 to 7 February 2020, the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology visited the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, CSIR, in Pretoria. This was the first visit conducted by the committee to the CSIR. The thirst of members to see in reality the research, development and innovation projects are testament to our aims as a government to increase the wellbeing and prosperity of society through science, technology and innovation. Science and innovation remains a pivotal port of our democracy and requires a long term dedicated support.</seg>,**

**<note type="speaker">Hon members:</note>**
**<who="#Members">We must continue our efforts to ensure that the space is intersectional and geographically accessible to all. Whilst we see the increased inclusion of women in the boards of various entities we must continue to strive for the overall increase of women in the entire composition of the department and its entities.</seg>,**

**<note type="speaker">The President calls on young people and students to lead the skills revolution, and to be the champions of innovation. Therefore, we must ensure increased inclusion of young people from all ends of our country. It must never be that those that are located in institutions with geographic proximity to the campuses of entities be the only ones who gain the most opportunities.</seg>,**

**<note type="speaker">The entities must be accessible to, in particular those historically marginalized from such opportunities, hon Boshoff.</note>**
