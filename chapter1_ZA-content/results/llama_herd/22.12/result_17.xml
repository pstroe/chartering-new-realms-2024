The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils.

The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 8 the membership of such boards. The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities.

The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs. In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017.

In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance. IsiZulu:
Sethemba ukuthi amalungu ahloniphekile aleNdlu azoweseka awuphasise loMthethosivivinyo ukuze siqubeke nalo msebenzi omuhle esiwenzayo wokusebenzisa ubuchwepheshe ukuze senze izimpilo zabantu bakithi zibe ngcono. Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.]

Mr M P MAPULANE: House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.

The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November 2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub- rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill.

The committee calls for public comment on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill. The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation.

In doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have their own principle acts. The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council.

It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees. The so called harmonisation has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014.

The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South African National Space Agency Act; and the Technology Innovation Act.

The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the termination of the membership of the boards or council, clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons of membership of council and provide for the appointment of external persons to committees. It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of the boards and council.

Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed with the goal:
</seg>

The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.

UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 13

The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.

Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth. Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14

R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.

Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development.

I thank you Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in the format all of the text. Format all of the text. Give only the formated text.

Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M N PAULSEN: Hon House Chairperson, the role of science and technology, in particular research and development is the industrialisation and betterment of society. Highly industrialised countries have used science and technology to drive industry in addressing the country’s challenges.

The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socioeconomic development of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, academic publishing, patents and commercial applications and is now in some areas and by some measures a world leader.

China is now increasingly targeting indigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses.

Cuba, despite continued sanctions is able to function into the same

We have brother Blade and brother Buti. However, let us look at South Africa. Failure by the ruling party to reconfigure research institutions post1994, has resulted in these institutions continuing to operate in silos and playing no role in the reduction of unemployment and inequality. However also, science and technology is deemed as elitist with very little accountability to the ruling party. If it was not elitist, our focus would have been on issues which affects the poor masses in this country, the provision of decent water and sanitation, the harnessing of renewable energy where implementation would be driven by a capable and capacitated state.

Minister Nzimande spoke of the Square Kilometre Array. Yes, it is in the Northern Cape, but the global headquarters are in the UK. These headquarters will ultimately be the owners of any intellectual property emanating from the Square Kilometre Array.

However, I am not surprised by the Minister’s lack of understanding of things that really matter. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is burning and there are serious allegations that a security service provider is responsible for the problems at the KwaZulu-Natal campuses. It is poor students who are given the blame and Minister you are here sitting and speaking about the Square Kilometre Array.

The purpose of this Bill focuses on the need to harmonise the entities within science and technology, but the Bill and these institutions are operating within a policy framework that prioritises research for selfish interest and greed. Harmonisation was already recommended in the Fourth Parliament and this House considered the First Amendment Bill in 2011. In April 2014, the Second Amendment Bill was considered.

Essentially the Second Amendment Bill proposed the harmonisation of processes which included the appointment of chairpersons and members of boards of science and technology entities, the qualifications of board members and the dissolution of boards.

However, what is laughable is the amendment of section 5 of Act 26 of 2008. Paragraph 8 says and I quote, “The board must be constituted in a manner that is broadly representatives of the demographics of the country.” South Africa is the only country where the government must make laws to empower the majority group of its citizens. Black people.

In other countries the government makes laws to empower minority groups. That is how weak we are as a democracy and a country.

The current Bill was proposed in the Fifth Parliament, but Parliament rose before the Bill could be considered. The current committee constitutes none of the ANC members of the Fifth Parliament. You have just replaced all of them, no continuity.

The research and development budget has declined and there has been a loss of critical scientific skills. This department does not have a plan to ensure that Industry 4,0 does not lead to greater inequality between the working class and those who continue to enjoy their tasks required and not because they are friends of the Ministers or other people.

The IFP supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]
