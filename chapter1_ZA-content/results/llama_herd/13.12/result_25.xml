  <chairperson-ms-m-g-boroto>The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.</chairperson-ms-m-g-boroto>
  <house-date tuesday="25 february 2020" page="2">The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements.</house-date>

  <chief-whip-of-the-opposition>The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I would like to raise a question, hon Chair. Is it in order for the Minister to be present in the House without having tabled any papers or making a statement on the Bill?</chief-whip-of-the-opposition>
  <chairperson-ms-m-g-boroto>The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon member, I think you are raising an issue of procedure. However, I will allow it.</chairperson-ms-m-g-boroto>

    Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.
    The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment,
    but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.
    An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations
    of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination
    of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils.

<seg xml:lang="en">Their allowance. The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.</seg>

  <text>The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.</text>
</doc>

<seg xml:lang="en">Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.</seg>

  <text>A notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values.</text>
</doc>

<seg xml:lang="en">The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.</seg>

  <title>UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020</title>

  <text>The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.</text>
</doc>

<seg xml:lang="en">Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.</seg>
