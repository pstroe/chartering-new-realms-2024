Here is a step-by-step guide on how to adapt the given raw text into a more coherent and readable format:

1. Remove unnecessary details: Some sections of the original text contain unnecessary information, such as the speaker's name, ID number, or specific dates. Remove these details to make the text more concise.

2. Group similar content together: The original text contains multiple speeches from different members of parliament. Grouping these speeches together can help to improve readability and flow.

3. Format paragraphs correctly: Many sections of the original text contain short sentences or phrases that are not properly formatted as paragraphs. Use a consistent paragraph structure (e.g., start each paragraph on a new line) to make the text more readable.

4. Remove repeated information: Some parts of the speech contain similar information, such as "Thank you very much, House Chair" followed by a few lines. Remove this repetition to reduce redundancy.

5. Improve sentence structure and clarity: Some sentences in the original text are wordy or awkwardly phrased. Use clear and concise language to improve readability.

6. Add headings or section breaks: Divide the text into sections using headings or breaks to make it easier to follow and understand.

Here is an example of how the adapted text could look like:
