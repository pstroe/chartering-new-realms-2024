This is the formatted version in XML. Let me know if there are any other tasks or questions I can assist with!
I'll help you with formatting the given raw text in the requested XML format, which seems to be a parliamentary document in the form of Hansard (a verbatim record of proceedings).

Here's the reformatted text in the XML format:

The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.

<speech xml:lang="en">
  <speaker>Mr M P MAPULANE:</speaker>
  House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.
</speech>

<note type="text">
The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. In doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have their own principle acts.
</note>

<speech xml:lang="en">
  <speaker>THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</speaker>
  The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council. It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees.
</speech>

<note type="text">
The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South African National Space Agency Act; and the Technology Innovation Act.

The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.

<note type="heading">UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020</note>

<page number="13">
    The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.

    Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth. Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth. Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development.

    I thank you.

<note type="speaker">Ms C V KING:</note>
<seg xml:lang="en">Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing.</seg>

<page number="15">
    The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation. Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance.

    On this basis this Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress. I thank you.

<note type="heading">Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy.</note>
