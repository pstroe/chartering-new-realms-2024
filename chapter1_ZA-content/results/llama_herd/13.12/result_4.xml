To adapt the given raw text in XML format to a more readable and structured format, we can apply some changes:

1. **Remove redundant elements**: Many of the elements like `<note type="speaker">`, `<seg>`, `<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u16" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">`, etc., are not necessary in this context and make the text harder to read.

2.  **Group related content together**: Grouping similar items like headings, speaker names, and comments can help clarify the structure of the text.

3.  **Format paragraphs correctly**: Ensure that each paragraph is properly formatted with a single line break between them for better readability.

4.  **Standardize formatting**: Use a consistent format throughout the text to make it easier to read and understand.


Here's an adapted version of the raw text in XML format:


<UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 1>
The House met at 14:00. House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.

</UNREVISHED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 2>

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements.

Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order? The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I think there was an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, ... IsiXhosa: ...ndiphakamisa ukuba lo Mthetho-siHlomelo oYilwayo wemiThetho yezobuNzululwazi nobuChwepheshe wamkelwe.

Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted.

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon ... The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

To adapt the given raw text, we need to make some changes to improve its clarity, coherence, and readability. Here are some steps we can take:

1. Simplify sentence structure: The original text has many long sentences with multiple clauses. We can break these down into simpler sentences for easier comprehension.

2. Clarify technical terms: The text uses technical terms like "clause by clause consideration," "section 75 Bill," and "socioeconomic impact assessment." We can define these terms or explain them in simple language to help non-experts understand the context.

3. Remove unnecessary details: Some parts of the text contain specific dates, names, and events that may not be essential to understanding the main point of the bill. We can remove these details if they don't add value to the discussion.

4. Use more descriptive headings: The original text doesn't have headings or subheadings that describe what each section is about. We can add headings like "Background," "Key Objectives," and "Significance" to help readers follow along.

5. Emphasize key points: The text could benefit from clearer connections between ideas and more emphasis on the main arguments in support of the bill.

Here's a possible adaptation of the original text based on these steps:

---

Background:
The Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill aims to standardize governance procedures across public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. This is crucial for ensuring consistent management, oversight, and strategic planning.

Key Objectives:
The bill seeks to:
- Harmonize statutory provisions regulating public entities
- Ensure efficient administrative relationships between departments and entities
- Provide clarity on termination of membership, disqualification of persons, and appointment processes

Significance:
Standardizing governance procedures will enable the department to better manage its relationships with entities and provide more effective oversight. It also ensures that the Minister has a voice in CEO appointments and fiduciary responsibility regarding board member remuneration.

Implementation:
The bill builds on previous efforts by harmonizing governance processes for two acts: the Academy of Science of South Africa Act and the Human Science Research Act. The current bill focuses on five key acts, including the Technology Innovation Act. It seeks to standardize termination procedures, clarify disqualification requirements, and provide for external committee appointments.

Conclusion:
By implementing this bill, we can create a more cohesive and effective governance framework across public entities reporting to the Department of Science and Innovation. This will enhance strategic planning, oversight, and collaboration between departments and entities.

---

This adaptation aims to simplify complex ideas, clarify technical terms, and focus on key points in support of the bill. It also adds headings and subheadings for easier comprehension.
To adapt the given raw text from the white paper on science and technology in South Africa, we will follow these steps:

1. Format the text according to the xml specification for accessibility.
