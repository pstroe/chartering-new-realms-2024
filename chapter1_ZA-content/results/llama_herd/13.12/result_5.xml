To adapt the given text as per your request, I will rephrase it in a straightforward and clear manner.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY asked House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation before proceeding with the next item on the Order Paper. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto) reminded members that on December 4, 2019, the House had adopted a rules committee report introducing amendments to their rules.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION pointed out that when there is no Minister in the House, they are not able to hear ministerial statements. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto) acknowledged this and said she sees at least one Minister but two Deputy Ministers who have yet to arrive.

The MINISTER of Higher Education, Science and Technology responded to the opposition's concerns by saying that they had made efforts to position science and technology as a catalyst for faster economic growth and development. They highlighted several projects, such as the completion of the SA National Space Agency's MeerKAT project within budget and on time, and the expansion of smart agriculture through the Technology Innovation Agency.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto) advised that she would consider adopting an amendment to their rules allowing for seven Ministerial Statements. The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY supported this move, but expressed frustration at the delay in the arrival of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.

By breaking down the original text into sections and adapting each section in a conversational tone, we've rephrased it in a more readable and engaging way that still maintains the accuracy of the content.
To adapt the given text in the specified format, let's break down the process into steps:

1. **Identify the raw text**: The provided text is the raw input that needs to be adapted into a specific format.

2. **Determine the target format**: The task requires adapting the text into an XML format. 

3. **Understand XML structure**: In XML, tags are used to enclose elements and attributes within them. 
   - `<note>` represents a note or a speech.
   - `type="speaker"` specifies that this is a speaker's note.
   - `seg` is short for "segment," which typically refers to a section of a document.
   - `xml:id` refers to an identifier, often used within XML documents.
   - `who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty"` identifies the person who wrote the message as the chief whip of the majority party.

4. **Identify and format key elements**: 
   - The text mentions several speakers (e.g., "The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:"), so we'll need to handle those correctly.
   - The date, time, page numbers, and location are crucial for the context but may not fit directly into an XML format.

5. **Clean up and adapt text**: 
    - Use standard sentence structure and grammar.
    - Remove any unnecessary or redundant information.
    - Format dates according to the desired precision (e.g., "2020-02-25" instead of just "February 25, 2020").

6. **Code the adapted text in XML format**:

  <heading>The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</heading>

  <body>
    <p>Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</p>

    <p>The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities.</p>

    <p>However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.</p>

    <p>Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.</p>

    <p>Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.</p>

    <p>Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values.</p>

    <p>The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in a similar manner.</p>

    <p>A lethargic process to ensure enactment should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament regarding this Bill.</p>

    <p>Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress.</p>
  </body>
