Reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.

An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from public office.

The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities. The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs.

In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the nation's future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.

Purpose of this Bill is not to solely ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive knowledge and skills development for post-school education.

An important aspect towards achieving these objectives is harmonising statutory provisions that regulate public entity operations. This Bill seeks, in addition to others, to harmonise processes for remuneration and allowance determination of members and committee chairs of boards or councils. Additionally, the Bill makes provision for termination of board memberships and disqualification of council members.

The Bill also aims to harmonise appointment procedures for chief executive officers, CEOs, of public entities. The amendments will correct the situation where the Minister has not had any input in appointing CEOs from some entities and thus provide for consultation with the Minister during the appointment process.

In the preparation of this Bill, all stakeholders were consulted individually, and the bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is essential that we ensure our nation's future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.
