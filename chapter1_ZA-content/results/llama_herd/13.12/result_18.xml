<UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY>
  <TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020>
    <Page: 1>
      <PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY>
        <The House met at 14:00.>
        <House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.>
        <The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.>
        <UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 2>
          <The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement? >
          <The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order.>
          <The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?>
          <The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the members of the house for this unparliamentary language... IsiXhosa: ...ndiphakamisa ukuba lo Mthetho-siHlomelo oYilwayo wemiThetho yezobuNzululwazi nobuChwepheshe wamkelwe.>
          <Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted. >
          <SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (Second Reading debate)>
          <The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone. Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports. IsiZulu: Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni senza ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje. English: There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations.</Page: 1>

<note type="text">The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.</note>

  <seg xml:lang="en">The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.</seg>
</doc>

<note type="text">Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.</note>

  <seg xml:lang="en">Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.</seg>
  <seg xml:lang="en">Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.</seg>
