<__TUESDAY_, 25 FEBRUARY 2020____
_PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY____
</t>

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.

<__The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes.__

With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement? 

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order.

<__The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?___

<__The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do ministerial statements but there are not any Ministers in the House.__

<__The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Order! I understand your point of order, hon Chief Whip of the Opposition. However, as you can see from the programme for today, we have moved on to another item._

...

<__CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL___

There was no debate.

<__The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper ___
IsiXhosa: ...ndiphakamisa ukuba lo Mthetho-siHlomelo oYilwayo wemiThetho yezobuNzululwazi nobuChwepheshe wamkelwe. Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted.

<__SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (Second Reading debate)___

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development.

<__Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs.__

For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion.

<__The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.__

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

<__IsiZulu: Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni senza ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje.__
English: There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations.

  their allowance.

  The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.

  <u xml:id="25-02-2020_u17" who="#DepartmentOfScienceAndTechnology">
    The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities.
  </u>

  However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.

  Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.

  Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.

  Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.

  The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.

  The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.

  Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.

  We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development.

  I thank you

<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u18" who="#MCKING">
  Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing.

  The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance.

  Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation. Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance.

  On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify the requirements for disqualification of persons from membership of boards of entities, and to strengthen oversight and governance.

  The DA was in favour of deleting any clauses that were contrary to the Public Finance Management Act and the insertion of the disclosure of conflict of interest clause.

  All inputs from various stakeholders were brought into fruition in this Bill. A lethargic process to ensure enactment should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament regarding this Bill.

  Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress.

  I thank you.
  [Applause.]
