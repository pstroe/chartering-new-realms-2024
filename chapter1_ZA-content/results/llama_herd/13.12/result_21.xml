It seems like you have a large block of text from a parliamentary debate in South Africa, specifically a Hansard transcript (a record of what was said in Parliament). You want me to assist you in formatting it into a specific XML format.

To get started, could you please specify the following:

1. What is the desired output format? I see that you mentioned "xml" at the end of your request.
2. Are there any specific sections or elements within the text that you would like me to focus on (e.g., speaker names, dates, bills being discussed)?
3. Is there a particular reason why you want this text in an XML format?

Once I have a better understanding of your requirements, I'll be happy to assist you with formatting and structuring the text according to your needs!
Here is the reformatted text in XML format:

```xml

  The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities.
  However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019,
  the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.
  Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.
  Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.

  A notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of R827 million in constant 2010 values.
  The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.
  The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.
  The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.
  The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.

  Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.
  We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development.

  The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance.
  Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation.
  Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance.

  On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify the requirements for disqualification of persons from membership of boards and to provide for the appointment of external persons to committees of the boards.
  Considering the recent flawed processes of public entity boards as highlighted in the state capture reports, these amendments are crucial to ensure that the Minister and chairpersons do not have autonomy over the boards and to ensure that any amendment holds constitutional muster.

  The Western Cape government in its submission of the Bill made some remarks. They stated that placing the responsibility of determining fit for purpose in the domain of the court of law is limiting and should have been added an additional insertion of “or a competent tribunal”.
  The DA was in favour of deleting any clauses that were contrary to the Public Finance Management Act and the insertion of the disclosure of conflict of interest clause.
  All inputs from various stakeholders were brought into fruition in this Bill.

  A lethargic process to ensure enactment should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament regarding this Bill.

  This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress.
