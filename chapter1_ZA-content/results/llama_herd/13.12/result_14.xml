PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

The House met at 14:00. House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?

THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order.

THE HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?

THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations.

THE MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, we shall proceed with the end goal:

<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u16" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty"> <seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, we shall proceed.</seg>, to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry.

This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from participating in such memberships.

The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities. The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs.

In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.

IsiZulu:

Sethemba ukuthi amalungu ahloniphekile aleNdlu azoweseka awuphasise loMthethosivivinyo ukuze siqubeke nalo msebenzi omuhle esiwenzayo wokusebenzisa ubuchwepheshe ukuze senze izimpilo zabantu bakithi zibe ngcono. Ngiyabonga.

Mr M P MAPULANE: House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.

The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November 2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub-rule 6, the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill.

The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019. However, this was not met due to the circumstances of that time. The current Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts:

* The 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act
* The 2008 Human Science Research Act
* The Science Research Council Act of 2008
* The South African National Space Agency Act
* And The Technology Innovation Act

The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the termination of the membership of the boards or council, clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons of membership of council and provide for the appointment of external persons to committees. It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of the boards and council.
