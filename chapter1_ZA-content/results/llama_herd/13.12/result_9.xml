TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 ____ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ____ The House met at 14:00. House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements.

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements.

Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto) has spoken and supports what you are saying, and I am advised by Mr Mahlangu that it is okay.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (Second Reading debate) 
The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY : Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 6 

members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country.

This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

...Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni senza ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje.
Here's an adapted version of the text in plain language:

The speaker of the House wants to know why this bill is being proposed before them today. The main reason is not just to make things more efficient, cost-effective, or aligned with strategic goals, but also to ensure that the various public entities under the Ministry of Science and Innovation operate harmoniously.

This includes changing rules for how remuneration and allowances are determined for members and committees of these boards, as well as clarifying procedures for terminating membership and excluding individuals from certain positions. The bill also aims to standardize how CEOs are appointed, making sure that the Minister's input is considered during this process.

Additionally, the amendments will correct an anomaly where a minister had no say in appointing some CEOs. This change is crucial because it ensures that the nation's future development and innovation paradigm are grounded in good governance principles.

The committee also consulted with various stakeholders before publishing the bill for public comment in 2017. They were satisfied that the changes followed a fair process, so they're confident that the House can adopt this bill as presented.
