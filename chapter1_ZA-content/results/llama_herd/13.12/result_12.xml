UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 1

TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Proceedings of the National Assembly

The House met at 14:00. House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019, the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements.

Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement? The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order. The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do ministerial statements but there are no Ministers present.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, I would like to move that we consider the report of the Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development.

Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs.

For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

I'd be happy to help you adapt the raw text!

It appears that the text is a speech or debate from the South African Parliament, specifically related to the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill. I'll do my best to rephrase it in a more readable format.

Here's my adaptation:

Honorable members of the House,

The reason for this Bill before you today is not only to improve administrative efficiency, cost containment, and strategic alignment, but also to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. An important aspect towards achieving our objectives is harmonizing the statutory provisions that regulate the operations of all public entities under our Ministry.

This Bill aims to, among other things, harmonize the processes for determining the remuneration and allowances of board members and committees. It also seeks to terminate membership on boards of these entities and disqualify individuals from joining or becoming members. Furthermore, it will standardize the appointment process for chief executive officers (CEOs) of these entities.

One crucial aspect of this Bill is ensuring that the Minister has a say in the appointments of CEOs, which was previously lacking. This provision aims to correct the anomalous situation where the Minister had no input in the selection of CEOs for some of our entities.

Throughout the preparation of this Bill, we consulted with all relevant stakeholders and published it for public comment in November 2017. In this context, it is essential that we ensure our nation's future science, technology, and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.
