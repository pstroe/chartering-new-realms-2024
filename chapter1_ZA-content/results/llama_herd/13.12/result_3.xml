**Pages: 1-5**

### Proceedings of the National Assembly

The House met at 14:00. **House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.**

**The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto):** Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019, we discussed the challenges facing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which is part of our role in supporting economic growth and development. Whilst there are SOEs responding positively, this Bill will ensure effective harnessing of their achievements.

### Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology: Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill

**The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:** Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, and hon Mapulane. As a department, we committed to positioning science as a catalyst for faster economic growth and development.

### Motion

**The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:** The SA National Space Agency has completed projects like the MeerKAT telescope within budget, with local content of 75% and direct investment in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory. We are also expanding smart agriculture through Technology Innovation Agency.

### Debate on Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill

**IsiZulu:** There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations. The main challenge is ensuring consistency in managing these entities.

**First Speaker (Minister):** Thank you very much, House Chairperson. As we move forward, it's crucial that we have a cohesive approach to supporting our SOEs for the benefit of all South Africans.

### Reports and Motions

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted.

This adaptation maintains the original content while improving its structure and readability, making it suitable for official Hansard documents or similar publications.
Here's a possible adaptation of the given raw text:

**Purpose of the Bill**

The purpose of this Bill is not solely to enhance administrative efficiency, cost containment, and strategic alignment, but also to drive the imperative for post-school knowledge and skills development more decisively.

A crucial aspect in achieving our objectives is harmonizing statutory provisions that regulate public entities under our Ministry. This Bill aims to:

1. Harmonize processes for determining remuneration and allowances of board members and committees.
2. Provide for termination of membership on boards and disqualification of members or potential members from such memberships.
3. Standardize appointment procedures for Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of these entities, ensuring the Minister's consultation during CEO appointments.

**Amendments and Consultation**

In preparing this Bill, all stakeholders were consulted individually, and it was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017.

**Importance of Governance Principles**

It is essential that our nation's future science, technology, and innovation paradigm is grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance. This Bill seeks to standardize governance processes across entities reporting to the Department of Science and Innovation, thereby:

1. Negating inconsistent, inadequate, and uncoordinated management among these entities.
2. Ensuring efficient administrative relationships between the department and entities, as well as effective oversight of entity boards and councils.
3. Granting the Minister a voice in CEO appointments and fiduciary responsibility regarding board member remuneration and allowances.

**Background and Context**

The Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018 was introduced to the Fifth Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology in November 2018. After public submissions and committee deliberations, the Bill was revived by this August House of the Sixth Parliament last year on October 29th.

**Objectives and Benefits**

The bill aims to ensure uniform governance principles and operational procedures across public entities under the Department of Science and Innovation. This standardization will:

1. Enhance departmental oversight and administrative efficiency.
2. Ensure fiduciary responsibility regarding board member remuneration and allowances.
3. Grant the Minister a voice in CEO appointments.

**Precedent and Progress**

The current Bill builds upon previous harmonization efforts, including the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and Act 7 of 2014. It specifically targets five key acts: the Academy of Science of South Africa Act, Human Science Research Act, Science Research Council Act, South African National Space Agency Act, and Technology Innovation Act.

By standardizing governance processes, this Bill seeks to promote consistency, accountability, and efficiency in the management of public entities under the Department of Science and Innovation.
To adapt the provided raw text, we need to reformat it according to the XML format, while maintaining its original meaning and content. Here's the adapted version:

The <note type="speaker">CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note> Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, we shall proceed.

Their allowance.

The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country. UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 13 The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.

Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey shows that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of R790 million to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private sector showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth. Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019.

We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development. I thank you Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing.

The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation. Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance. On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify the requirements for disqualification of persons from membership of boards and to provide for the appointment of external persons to committees of the boards.

Considering the recent flawed process to ensure enactment should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament regarding this Bill. Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress. I thank you.
