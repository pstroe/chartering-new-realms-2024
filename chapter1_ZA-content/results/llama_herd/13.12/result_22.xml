<text xml:id="national_assembly_2020-02-25_text1">
  The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.
</text>

<text xml:id="national_assembly_2020-02-25_text2">
  UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 13
  The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.
</text>

<text xml:id="national_assembly_2020-02-25_text3">
  Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth. Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.
</text>

<text xml:id="national_assembly_2020-02-25_text4">
  Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to up their games and increase the investment in research and development so that the country is able to attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product, GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development.

  <seg xml:lang="en">Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing.</seg>

  Change is scientific; progress is ethical; change is indubitable, whereas progress is a matter of controversy. This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress.
