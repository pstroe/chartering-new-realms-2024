It seems you want me to reformat the given text in a specific XML format. I'll do my best to assist you.

However, please note that the provided text is already in an XML-like format (UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY) with tags and attributes. To help you further, I'll highlight some key elements:

* The main speaker is identified by the `who` attribute, e.g., `<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u16" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">`.
* Segments of speech are enclosed within `<seg>` tags with a `lang` attribute specifying the language (e.g., `<seg xml:lang="en">...)</seg>`.
* The original text is already in a structured format, so I'll assume you want me to help you identify and extract specific information rather than modifying the existing structure.

Could you please specify what you'd like me to focus on or which parts of the text you need assistance with?

**The Chief Whip of the Majority Party:**

Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.

The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.

An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to:

* Harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils.
* Make provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from such boards.
* Provide for the appointment of chief executive officers (CEOs) of the entities.

The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs.

In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017.

**Mr M P Mapulane:**

House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President,

It gives great pleasure to present the committee report and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.

The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliamentâ€™s Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November 2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub-rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill.

The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019. However, because the Bill focuses exclusively on the operational and administrative governance procedures of the entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation, no submissions were received from the public.

**Key Objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill:**

* Ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation.
* Negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have their own principle acts.
* Standardise governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council.

**Current Status:**

The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed:

* The Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 16 of 2011
* The Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014

The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are:

* The 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act;
* The 2008 Human Science Research Act;
* The Science Research Council Act of 2008;
* The South African National Space Agency Act; and
* The Technology Innovation Act.

    <text>The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.</text>
    <list type="bullet">
      <item>Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.</item>

    <text>A notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of R827 million in constant 2010 values.</text>
    <list type="bullet">
      <item>The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.</item>
      <item>The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.</item>
      <item>The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.</item>

    <text>We believe that this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that increase in research and development. I thank you Ms C V KING: Hon House Chairperson, the scientific perspective of the world, especially the living world, inexorably impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and structures involved in continuous and incessant change and in process without ceasing.</text>

    <speaker>THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</speaker>
    <text>The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on discussion and consultation.</text>
    <list type="bullet">
      <item>Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of public entities with different requirements regulating the operations and governance.</item>

    <speaker>THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</speaker>
    <text>This Bill is addressing ethical standards which should not be of a controversial nature to hinder progress. I thank you. [Applause.],</text>
