  <segment xml:lang="en">
    Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.
    The reason for this Bill before you today is not to simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost containment and strategic alignment,
    but it also aims to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    An important dimension towards the realisation of our objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions which regulate the operations of all public entities falling under our Ministry.
    This Bill seeks to, amongst others, harmonise the processes for the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of boards or councils.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The Bill also makes provision for the termination of membership of boards of the entities,
    as well as the disqualification of members or potential members from UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 8
    the membership of such boards.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The Bill also seeks to harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive officers, CEOs, of the entities.
    The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of some of our entities and would thus make provision for consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such CEOs.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and affected stakeholders were consulted individually
    and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017.

  <speaker type="member">Mr M P MAPULANE</speaker>
  <segment xml:lang="en">
    House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon members, fellow South Africans,
    the Deputy President, it gives great pleasure to present the committee report
    and to participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill 42 of 2019.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and operational procedures are applied across the public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation.
    In doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and uncoordinated management of these entities,
    each of which have their own principle acts.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The standardisation of governance and operational procedures of the public entities that report to the department
    allows the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities as well as more effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and council.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in the appointment of the entityâ€™s Chief Executive Officers
    and ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the remuneration and allowance of board and council members and their committees.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The so-called harmonisation has started by the department during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted in two amendment acts being passed
    and that is the Science and Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The current Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the following five principal acts which are:
    the 2001 Academy of Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research Act 1998;
    the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South African National Space Agency Act;
    and the Technology Innovation Act.
  </segment>

  <segment xml:lang="en">
    The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the termination of the membership of the boards or council,
    clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons of membership of council
    and provide for the appointment of external persons to committees.

  <seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</seg>

<seg xml:lang="en">The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as a network of institutions, organisations and policies that work together to achieve a common set of social and economic goals and objectives for the development of science and technology in our country.</seg>

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u17" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
  <seg xml:lang="en">However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.</seg>

</u>

<seg xml:lang="en">Therefore, South Africa is not yet fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens.</seg>

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u18" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
  <seg xml:lang="en">Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak partnership and so forth.</seg>

</u>

<seg xml:lang="en">Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of R827 million in constant 2010 values.</seg>

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u19" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
  <seg xml:lang="en">The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development.</seg>

</u>

<seg xml:lang="en">The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.</seg>

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u20" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
  <seg xml:lang="en">The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.</seg>

</u>

<seg xml:lang="en">The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.</seg>

<note type="speaker">The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:</note>
<u xml:id="25-02-2020_u21" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty">
  <seg xml:lang="en">Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector that they need to increase their research and development expenditure in order to improve the economy of South Africa.</seg>
