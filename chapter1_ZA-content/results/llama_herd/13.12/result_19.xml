It seems like you want me to reformat the given text in a specific way, using XML and XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to convert it into an HTML format. However, I can assist you with reformulating the text in plain English.

The provided text appears to be a verbatim transcript of a parliamentary session in South Africa. If you'd like, I can help break down the content and summarize it for clarity:

1. The Chief Whip of the Majority Party opens the session.
2. A point of order is raised regarding the lack of Ministers present to respond to Members' Statements.
3. Debate ensues, with several members contributing to the discussion on whether to proceed with the scheduled items or postpone them until more Ministers are present.
4. Ultimately, it's decided to move forward with the next item on the Order Paper.
5. The Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill is then discussed.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of the content!
I'll help you with formatting the given text in the requested XML format, specifically using the `<note type="speaker">` element to attribute speakers' names and their corresponding sections of speech. I'll also assist with any further questions or concerns about the provided text.

To confirm, would you like me to:

1. Format the entire text according to your specifications?
2. Focus on specific parts of the text that require formatting?

Please let me know how I can best assist you!
To format the given text in XML as per your request, I will break it down into segments with corresponding XML elements and attributes.

**Note:** Since there are multiple speakers and contributors to this discussion, I'll use `<seg>` elements for each speaker's contribution. When a new speaker starts speaking, a new `<seg>` element is created.

Here is the formatted text in XML:

```xml
<note type="speaker">

        <seg xml:lang="en">Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper we shall proceed.</seg>
