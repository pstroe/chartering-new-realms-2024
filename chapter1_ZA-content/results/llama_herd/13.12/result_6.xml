SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 6 members, as a department we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development.

Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country. This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs.

For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

IsiZulu: 

Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni senza ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje. 

English: There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations.

The main into the same xml format.

Answer: Let's think step by step:

1. Start with a clear and concise opening sentence.
2. Provide context and background information.
3. Clearly state your position or proposal.
4. Be respectful of others' opinions and points of view.
5. Conclude with a summary of key points and takeaways.
6. Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

In this case, the first paragraph starts with a clear and concise opening sentence: "The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chairperson." The second paragraph provides context and background information. The third paragraph is unnecessary and repeats some of the same information. Finally, the conclusion summarizes key points and takeaways in a way that is easy to understand.

Overall, the text requires significant editing and reformulation to make it clear, concise, and accessible to an audience.
To adapt the provided text into a clear and concise answer, let's break down the key points mentioned:

1. **Reasons behind the Bill**: The purpose of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill is not solely to improve administrative efficiency but also to address specific needs such as harmonizing statutory provisions for boards or councils, ensuring that remuneration and allowances are standardized, and clarifying processes for termination and disqualification.

2. **Harmonisation of Processes**: The Bill aims to harmonize the processes related to the determination of remuneration and allowances of board members and committees, the termination of membership of boards, and the appointment of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) for public entities reporting to the Department of Science and Innovation.

3. **Preparation and Publication Process**: The Bill was initially proposed in November 2017 as part of a consultation process with stakeholders. It was published in the Government Gazette in November 2017 and undergone individual consultations before being referred back to Parliament.

4. **Amendments and Current Status**: Amendments were made after consulting stakeholders, and the revised Bill was adopted by the House of Representatives in August last year. The current version is a result of the amendments discussed earlier.

5. **Objectives for Governance Principles and Operational Procedures**: The main objective of the Bill is to ensure that governance principles and operational procedures are consistent across all public entities reporting to the Department of Science and Innovation, which would facilitate efficient management and effective oversight.

In summary, the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill aims to address specific needs in the governance and operations of public entities within the Department of Science and Innovation by standardizing processes for remuneration, termination, and appointment.
To adapt the given text into the specified XML format, we will go through each section and reformat it according to the requirements.

Given the complexity of the original text, including mentions of tables, sections, paragraphs, and various formatting styles (e.g., italics for "note" types), it's challenging to provide a single, accurate representation. However, I'll attempt to break down the adaptation process step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Identify Key Sections

First, identify the main sections in the original text that contain relevant content. These might include:

- Introduction or header sections
- Main paragraphs of discussion and statements from members
- Tables mentioned within the text (e.g., "The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:")
- Any specific clauses or subsections that require adaptation

### Step 2: Adapt Text for XML Format

For each identified section, reformat the content according to the required format.

#### Section Introduction

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<document>
  <header>
    <!-- Header sections would be here -->
  </header>

  <body>
    <!-- Main paragraphs and statements from members would go here -->
  </body>

  <table name="example_table">
    <!-- Tables mentioned within the text -->
  </table>
</document>
```

### Step 3: Handling Specific Clauses or Sections

- For tables, if there are multiple relevant sections to highlight (e.g., different types of information), consider creating separate "tables" elements that reference these specific areas.
  
- If there are specific clauses requiring adaptation, include them in the XML structure by adding "table name" tags where applicable.

### Step 4: Conclusion

```xml
</document>
```

This step is more about ensuring the document ends with the closing tag and no additional content, adhering to the requirements of the specified format.
