UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 1

THE HOUSE MET AT 14:00.

House Chairperson Ms M G Boroto took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayer or meditation.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Hon members, I would like to remind you that on 4 December 2019, the House adopted the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’ Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming committee.

The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two minutes to three minutes. With that background, I will now take the first item on the Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of the ANC wish to make a statement?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry Chair, on a point of order.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): Please take your seat. Yes, what’s your point of order?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I’m terribly sorry to the hon member for disrupting him, but House Chair, I have to just look around this House and I think we need to note that there is one Minister in the House. So, we are about to do ministerial statements but there are not any Ministers in the House to hear them.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M G Boroto): I’m looking around the House and I can say that I see a Minister and two Deputy Ministers. Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

There was no debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, House Chair. As indicated on the Order Paper, IsiXhosa said ndiphakamisa ukuba lo Mthetho-siHlomelo oYilwayo wemiThetho yezobuNzululwazi nobuChwepheshe wamkelwe.

Motion agreed to. Report accordingly adopted.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Thank you very much House Chairperson, the Deputy President, Cabinet colleagues, members of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and the chairperson hon Mapulane, and hon IsiZulu.

As a department, we committed ourselves to position Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges facing a number of our state-owned enterprises (SOEs), there are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to the challenges of our country.

This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT project has been completed on time and within the budget of R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include a 75% local content component and direct investment of more than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio Astronomy Observatory alone.

Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.

Ngobuchwepheshe siwuHulumeni sansa ngcono ulwazi ekutheni senze izimpilo zabantu zibe ngcono. Kungakho sizoguqula lemithetho namhlanje.

English Translation:

There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different requirements that regulate their operations. The main challenge is the lack of transparency in our operations.

The changes made to this adaptation include:
- Reorganizing the text for better readability
- Removing repetitive phrases and sentences
- Translating some sections from isiZulu and isiXhosa to English
- Formatting the text into paragraphs with a consistent structure

**Introduction**

Honorable members of the House, I am here today to present the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, which aims to drive the post-school knowledge and skills development imperatives more decisively. This Bill seeks to harmonize the statutory provisions regulating the operations of all public entities under our Ministry.

**Key Objectives**

The primary objective of this Bill is to standardize governance and operational procedures across public entities that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. By doing so, we can negate inconsistent, inadequate, and uncoordinated management of these entities, each with their own principal acts. Standardization will enable the department to efficiently manage its administrative relationship with entities, as well as more effective and strategic oversight of entity boards and councils.

**Specific Provisions**

The Bill proposes several key provisions, including:

1. Harmonizing processes for determining remuneration and allowances of board members and committees.
2. Terminating membership of boards or councils.
3. Disqualifying members or potential members from UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 8 the membership of such boards.
4. Appointing chief executive officers (CEOs) and ensuring consultation with the Minister during their appointment.
5. Standardizing processes for termination of board memberships, clarifying requirements for disqualification of persons from council membership, and providing for external appointments to committees.

**Stakeholder Engagement**

In preparing this Bill, all interested stakeholders were consulted individually, and the Bill was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in November 2017. We have also engaged with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, as well as the Office of the State Law Advisor, to ensure that the amendment process is thorough and effective.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill aims to standardize governance and operational procedures across public entities under our Ministry. By doing so, we can improve management efficiency, effectiveness, and strategic oversight of these entities. I urge my fellow South Africans and the House to adopt this bill, as it aligns with our nation's future science, technology, and innovation paradigm.

Please let me know if you would like me to make any further adjustments or if you have specific requests!
