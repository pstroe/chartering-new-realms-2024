                    like to remind you that on 4 December 2019 the House adopted
                    the Rules Committee report which introduced a number of
                    amendments to our rules. Some of the amendments pertain to the
                    sequence of proceedings and Members’ Statements. To facilitate
                    sufficient opportunity for Ministers’ Responses to Members’
                    Statements, the sequence of proceedings has been amended so
                    that Members’ Statements are now at the start of the
                    proceedings on days that they are scheduled by the programming
                    committee.

                <seg xml:lang="en">The Rules Committee further agreed that the number of
                    Ministers’ Responses be increased from six to seven and that
                    time allowed for Ministers’ Responses be increased from two
                    minutes to three minutes.
                    With that background, I will now take the first item on the
                    Order Paper which is Members’ Statements. Does any member of
                    the ANC wish to make a statement?

                        members, as a department we committed ourselves to position
                        Science and Technology as a catalyst towards faster economic
                        growth and development. Whilst we acknowledge the challenges
                        facing a number of our state-owned enterprises, SOEs, there
                        are nevertheless those that are responding very positively to
                        the challenges of our country.
                        This Bill will ensure that effectively we will be able to
                        harness the achievements of our SOEs. For instance, through
                        the SA National Space Agency, the South African MeerKAT
                        project has been completed on time and within the budget of
                        R3,2 billion. The benefits of hosting these telescopes include
                        a 75% local content component and direct investment of more
                        than R300 million in the Northern Cape by the SA Radio
                        Astronomy Observatory alone.
                        Through the Technology Innovation Agency we continue to
                        harness the latest advances in smart agriculture. In this
                        regard, we are substantially expanding the agriculture and
                        agroprocessing sector by supporting key value chains and
                        products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on
                        agricultural imports.

                        There had been an inconsistent and unco-ordinated management
                        of public entities reporting to our Ministry, with different
                        requirements that regulate their operations.
                        The main reason for this Bill before you today is not to
                        simply ensure greater administrative efficiency, cost
                        containment and strategic alignment, but it also aims to drive
                        the postschool knowledge and skills development imperatives
                        more decisively.
                        An important dimension towards the realisation of our
                        objectives is that of harmonising the statutory provisions
                        which regulate the operations of all public entities falling
                        under our Ministry. This Bill seeks to, amongst others,
                        harmonise the processes for the determination of the
                        remuneration and allowances of the members and committees of
                        boards or councils. The Bill also makes provision for the
                        termination of membership of boards of the entities, as well
                        as the disqualification of members or potential members from
                    </seg>
                    <seg xml:lang="en">
                        the membership of such boards. The Bill also seeks to
                        harmonise the processes for the appointment of chief executive
                        officers, CEOs, of the entities.
                        The amendments will also correct the anomalous situation where
                        the Minister has had no say in the appointments of CEOs of
                        some of our entities and would thus make provision for
                        consultation with the Minister during the appointment of such
                        CEOs.
                        In the process of preparing this Bill, all interested and
                        affected stakeholders were consulted individually and the Bill
                        was published in the Government Gazette for public comment in
                        November 2017.
                        In this context, it is crucial that we ensure that the
                        nation’s future science, technology and innovation paradigm is
                        grounded on tried and tested principles of good governance.

                        House Chair, hon Minister Nzimande, hon
                        members, fellow South Africans, the Deputy President, it gives
                        great pleasure to present the committee report and to
                        participate in this debate on the Science and Technology Laws
                        Amendment Bill 42 of 2018.
                        The Bill was introduced and referred to the Fifth Parliament’s
                        Portfolio Committee on Science and Technology on 1 November
                        2018. On 5 December 2018, in terms of the joint rule 160 sub-
                        rule 6 the joint taking mechanism classified the Science and
                        Technology Laws Amendment Bill as a section 75 Bill.
                        The committee calls for public submissions on the Science and
                        Technology Laws Amendment Bill from the 1 to 15 February 2019.
                        However, because the Bill focuses exclusively on the
                        operational and administrative governance procedures of the
                        entities that report to the Department of Science and
                        Innovation, no submissions were received from the public.
                        The process to consider the amendment proposed by the Science
                        and Technology Laws Amendment Bill was done in collaboration
                        with the Parliament’s Legal Services, the Office of the State
                        Law Advisor and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and
                        Evaluation. The Department of Planning, Monitoring and

                        Evaluation exempted the department from the application of the
                        socioeconomic impact assessment in respect of the Bill since
                        it did not directly affect the public.
                        The department briefed the committee on the Bill on 20
                        February 2019, two of the committee meetings on 27 and 6 March
                        were dedicated to the clause by clause consideration and the
                        adoption of the clause by clause amendments and the
                        committee’s report on the Bill, which the committee’s report
                        on the Bill and the allies were published on 11 March 2019.
                        However, the committee’s report was not considered by the NA
                        due to the conclusion of the of the Fifth Parliament’s term.
                        The Bill was subsequently revived by this August House of the
                        Sixth Parliament last year on 29 October and referred to the
                        Portfolio Committee on Higher Education Science and
                        Technology.
                        Following the briefing by the department on 20 November, the
                        committee considered the Bill and the amendments effected by
                        the previous portfolio committee and we are satisfied that the
                        substance and the processes followed are in order and
                        therefore are confident that this House can adopt the Science
                        and Technology Amendment Bill as adopted.

                        The objectives of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment
                        Bill are to ensure that the same governance principles and
                        operational procedures are applied across the public entities
                        that report to the Department of Science and Innovation. In
                        doing so, to negate the inconsistent, inadequate and
                        uncoordinated management of these entities, each of which have
                        their own principle acts. The standardisation of governance
                        and operational procedures of the public entities that report
                        to the department allows the department to efficiently manage
                        its administrative relationship with entities as well as more
                        effective and strategic oversight of the entity boards and
                        council.
                        It also affords the department through the Minister a voice in
                        the appointment of the entity’s Chief Executive Officers and
                        ensuring fiduciary responsibility with regard to the
                        remuneration and allowance of board and council members and
                        their committees.
                        The so called harmonisation has started by the department
                        during the fourth term of Parliament and has so far resulted
                        in two amendment acts being passed and that is the Science and
                        Technology Laws Amendment 16 of 2011 and the Science and
                        Technology Laws Amendment Act 7 of 2014. The current Science

                        and Technology Laws Amendment Bill specifically focus on the
                        following five principal acts which are: the 2001 Academy of
                        Science of South Africa Act; the 2008 Human Science Research
                        Act 1998; the Science Research Council Act of 2008; the South
                        African National Space Agency Act; and the Technology
                        Innovation Act.
                        The Bill seeks to standardise the processes for the
                        termination of the membership of the boards or council,
                        clarify the requirements for the disqualification of persons
                        of membership of council and provide for the appointment of
                        external persons to committees.
                        It also ensures that the Minister responsible for science and
                        innovation can determine the remuneration and allowances of
                        the boards and council and their allowance.
                        The 1996 White Paper on science and technology introduced a
                        concept of a national system of innovation which is defined as
                        a network of institutions, organisations and policies that
                        work together to achieve a common set of social and economic
                        goals and objectives for the development of science and
                        technology in our country.

                        The department is responsible for developing, coordinating and
                        managing the system of innovation together with the eight
                        entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996
                        White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number
                        of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996
                        White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new
                        White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March
                        2019, the various reviews of the National System of
                        Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite
                        significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal
                        in the 1996 White Paper. Therefore, South Africa is not yet
                        fully benefited from the potential Science, Technology and
                        Innovation, STI, to advance the economy and improve the
                        livelihoods of its citizens.
                        Key challenges constraining the performance of NSI are the
                        inadequate and collaborative means of national STI agenda
                        sitting, insufficient policy coherence, coordination, weak
                        partnership and so forth.
                        Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and
                        experimental development survey show that higher education
                        sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in
                        the gross expenditure on research and development of

                        R827 million in constant 2010 values. The higher education
                        sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in
                        research and development. The research and development in the
                        business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned
                        enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is
                        calculated in constant 2010 values to this. The private that
                        is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in
                        research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values.
                        The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science
                        sector showed a marginal growth.
                        Therefore it is our call hon members to the business sector
                        that they need to up their games and increase the investment
                        in research and development so that the country is able to
                        attain the 1.4% expenditure on the Gross domestic product,
                        GDP, by 2019. We believe that this Science and Technology Laws
                        Amendment Bill will contribute significantly towards that
                        increase in research and development. I thank you

                        impresses on us a dynamic picture of the world of entities and

                        The proposed amendments of this Bill are of a technical nature
                        which seeks to harmonise the operations of entities in the
                        science and technology sector to strengthen oversight and
                        governance. Considering the technical nature of the Science
                        and Technology Laws Amendment Bill, the initial introduction
                        at the end of the Fifth Parliament, did little justice on
                        discussion and consultation.
                        Improper norms and standards for entities resulted in
                        inconsistent, inadequate and unco-ordinated management of
                        public entities with different requirements regulating the
                        operations and governance.
                        On this basis this Bill seeks to harmonise the processes for
                        termination of membership of boards of entities, to clarify
                        the requirements for disqualification of persons from
                        membership of boards and to provide for the appointment of
                        external persons to committees of the boards.
                        Considering the recent flawed processes of public entity
                        boards as highlighted in the state capture reports, these
                        amendments are crucial to ensure that the Minister and

                    <seg xml:lang="en">
                        chairpersons do not have autonomy over the boards and to
                        ensure that any amendment holds constitutional muster.
                        The Western Cape government in its submission of the Bill
                        expressed the importance of fit for purpose when appointed to
                        the boards, the inclusion of an appeals committee and the
                        chief executive officer, CEO’s term of office. Clause 22
                        interpretation of being convicted of fraud, corruption or any
                        other crime involving dishonesty, within a period of 10 years
                        preceding the date of nomination can be left open for abuse.
                        The time period should have been realistically considered.
                        Also placing the responsibility of determining fit for purpose
                        in the domain of the court of law is limiting and should have
                        been added an additional insertion of “or a competent
                        tribunal”.
                        The DA was in favour of deleting any clauses that were
                        contrary to the Public Finance Management Act and the
                        insertion of the disclosure of conflict of interest clause.
                        All inputs from various stakeholders were brought into
                        fruition in this Bill. A lethargic process to ensure enactment
                        should be avoided as happened in the previous Parliament
                        regarding this Bill.
