# Chapter 8: Evaluation of multimodal LM trained on graphic images from specific historical period
by Blagoja Trajkovski
## Abstract
This chapter presents an in-depth evaluation of a multimodal language model (MLM) trained on graphic images from the Renaissance period, focusing on its ability to process and understand the intricate relationships between visual artwork and textual descriptions. The Renaissance, a transformative period in art, science, and culture, offers a unique context for testing the effectiveness of multimodal AI models, due to the distinct artistic styles, historical significance, and symbolic depth of its visual works. In this study, a curated dataset comprising high-resolution images and historically accurate textual annotations was used to train and evaluate the MLM’s performance. The model’s abilities were assessed across a variety of tasks, including image-text retrieval, caption generation, and the recognition of stylistic elements and thematic content. Experimental results demonstrate that the model performs well in understanding the visual and contextual nuances of Renaissance artwork, with strong performance in aligning textual descriptions with images. However, challenges related to symbolic interpretation, abstract concepts, and the need for deeper domain-specific knowledge highlight limitations of current models. These findings emphasize the potential of multimodal AI in advancing historical and cultural analysis, suggesting future research directions in enhancing symbolic reasoning, expanding datasets to include more cultural perspectives, and integrating the model into interactive tools for public engagement and educational purposes.

## Introduction
The Renaissance, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, was a period marked by profound cultural, artistic, and intellectual transformations. It was a time when the worlds of art, science, and philosophy began to intersect in new and groundbreaking ways. Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Albrecht Dürer not only produced masterpieces that continue to define Western art, but they also introduced new scientific approaches, anatomical studies, and natural world observations that reshaped contemporary knowledge. The complex, multifaceted nature of Renaissance artworks makes them a rich and dynamic subject for study, particularly in terms of how they reflect and engage with the broader cultural, religious, and intellectual shifts of the time.

Given the deep symbolism, thematic richness, and stylistic intricacies of Renaissance artworks, interpreting these images requires a sophisticated understanding that goes beyond surface-level description. The ability to accurately analyze and generate textual descriptions for such works is a challenge that has traditionally required the expertise of art historians and cultural scholars. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the field of multimodal language models (MLMs), offer the potential to automate this process by simultaneously analyzing both visual and textual data.

Multimodal models, which integrate and process multiple types of data, have shown great promise in tasks that require understanding relationships between text and images. These models, typically built on transformer architectures, allow for a more holistic approach to tasks like image-captioning, image retrieval, and even generating complex analyses based on both visual and textual inputs. While the application of such models to general datasets has seen impressive results, their use in the analysis of historical and artistic data presents unique challenges. Renaissance artworks are rich in both visual detail and historical context, which means that a model trained on such data must not only be capable of understanding stylistic nuances but also contextualizing the work within its historical period.

This chapter investigates the capabilities of a multimodal language model trained specifically on graphic images from the Renaissance. By evaluating the model’s performance on tasks such as image-text retrieval, caption generation, and symbolic interpretation, this study aims to explore the strengths and weaknesses of applying AI to the analysis of historical artifacts. The study also examines the ways in which multimodal AI can enhance the field of art history, offering new tools for research, curation, and education. While the findings suggest that AI has significant potential for historical and cultural analysis, the study also highlights the challenges and limitations of current multimodal systems, particularly in terms of their ability to interpret abstract symbolism and the need for more domain-specific training. Ultimately, this chapter aims to show the transformative potential of multimodal AI in the humanities while outlining the directions for future research and development.

## Related Work
The development and application of multimodal models, particularly in the context of historical and artistic analysis, has been a subject of growing interest in recent years. Several key studies have contributed to our understanding of how these models can be utilized in complex cultural contexts, each addressing different aspects of visual-textual relationships, art analysis, and historical data interpretation. This section reviews three prominent pieces of work that provide the foundation for the current study and outline the direction for further advancements.
CLIP: Learning Transferable Visual Models from Natural Language Supervision
One of the seminal works in the field of multimodal AI is the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model introduced by Radford et al. (2021). CLIP is based on a transformer architecture and trained on a large dataset of images and text from a variety of sources. The model leverages contrastive learning, where the task is to predict whether a given text description corresponds to a particular image. By learning a joint embedding space, CLIP can generalize across a wide range of image-text pairs and perform tasks like image search and caption generation. Although CLIP achieved impressive results in a variety of general tasks, its application to domain-specific datasets, such as Renaissance art, has been less explored. This gap underscores the need for fine-tuned models that can effectively interpret the unique stylistic and thematic elements of Renaissance artwork. In the present study, CLIP serves as a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of multimodal models in historical and artistic contexts, highlighting the need for further refinement when dealing with specialized cultural and historical data. Visual and Textual Representations in Historical Archives Another important contribution comes from Lehmann et al. (2020), who examined the application of multimodal AI to historical archives, particularly those that involve visual representations such as manuscripts, illustrations, and early printed books. Their study emphasized the challenges of working with historical datasets, which often contain complex, archaic language and visual styles that are difficult for contemporary models to interpret accurately. One of the primary obstacles noted in their research was the problem of preprocessing, as historical texts often contain non-standard linguistic forms, and images may suffer from degradation or incomplete preservation. To address these issues, the authors suggested the use of domain-specific preprocessing steps, such as semantic enrichment and contextual grounding, to better align the visual and textual data. This aligns with the objectives of the current study, which similarly uses a specialized dataset of Renaissance graphic images and textual annotations to train and evaluate the multimodal model. The challenges identified by Lehmann et al. have been critical in shaping the methodology of the present research, especially in terms of curating and processing historical data for AI systems. Symbolism and Style Recognition in Art Analysis Zhou et al. (2022) focused on using deep learning to recognize and interpret symbolic elements in art. Their research explored how neural networks can be employed not just for aesthetic analysis, but also for understanding the underlying symbolic and allegorical content of visual works. Symbolism plays a crucial role in Renaissance art, with many works containing layers of meaning that are not immediately apparent from the visual image alone. These symbolic elements often require extensive contextual knowledge of the period's philosophical, religious, and political climate to fully understand. Zhou et al.’s work demonstrated the utility of combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning frameworks to enhance a model’s ability to interpret abstract concepts. While their approach showed promise, it also highlighted the limitations of current AI systems in fully grasping the depth of symbolic meaning in visual art. In the present study, this work serves as a crucial reference point for understanding the challenges of interpreting symbolic elements in Renaissance artworks and suggests that future models should integrate symbolic reasoning alongside visual-textual analysis to provide deeper insights.

PHD: Pixel-Based Language Modeling of Historical Documents. This study introduces PHD, a pixel-based language model designed for historical documents. Unlike traditional methods that rely on OCR, PHD treats documents as images, capturing both textual and visual nuances. Pre-trained on synthetic and real historical scans from the 1700-1900 period, PHD demonstrates proficiency in reconstructing masked image patches and exhibits notable language understanding capabilities. Its application to historical question-answering tasks underscores its utility in analyzing historical documents. A Comprehensive Study of Multimodal Large Language Models for Image Quality Assessment. This paper explores the potential of MLLMs in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), a domain traditionally dominated by models focusing solely on visual inputs. The study investigates various prompting systems and evaluates multiple MLLMs on visual attributes pertinent to image quality, including structural distortions and color differences. Findings suggest that while certain MLLMs, like GPT-4V, align reasonably with human perception, challenges remain in discriminating fine-grained quality variations.

These foundational works have helped shape the direction of this study, underscoring the potential and challenges of applying multimodal models to historical and artistic analysis. While progress has been made in integrating visual and textual data, the need for more sophisticated models that can handle domain-specific knowledge, symbolic interpretation, and cultural nuances remains pressing. The present study seeks to build on these contributions by tailoring a multimodal language model specifically for the Renaissance period, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the realm of cultural heritage preservation and analysis.

## Data & Methodology
### Data Collection
The dataset curated for this study was designed to encapsulate the breadth and depth of the Renaissance's visual and textual artifacts. This period, spanning the 14th to the 17th century, witnessed an unparalleled flourishing of artistic, scientific, and cultural achievements. The focus of data collection was to ensure representation across these diverse domains, with an emphasis on high-quality annotations that reflect both stylistic and contextual nuances.

-FID Score: A score of 26.8 highlighted the stylistic coherence of outputs.

### Comparative Analysis
The model was benchmarked against generic multimodal models such as CLIP and BLIP. Results indicated significant performance gains due to domain-specific fine-tuning.

### Expanded Qualitative Analysis
Expert evaluations provided deeper insights into the model's interpretative accuracy:

-Symbolism Interpretation: While capable of describing overt features (e.g., halos or scales), the model often lacked the depth to analyze symbolic layers fully.

-Regional Styles: Experts praised the model’s nuanced recognition of stylistic variations, such as Northern Europe’s Gothic detailing versus Italian Humanism.

## Conclusion

This study highlights the potential of multimodal language models to analyze and interpret Renaissance graphic images, bridging the gap between computational tools and historical analysis. Key findings are the follwing.
Firstly, the model demonstrated strong performance in aligning images and captions, showcasing its ability to capture the interplay between visual and textual modalities. Secondly, outputs were linguistically coherent and stylistically aligned with Renaissance-era descriptions, indicating the model’s adaptability to historical contexts.
Lastly, the findings underscore the utility of MLMs in areas such as cultural preservation, art education, and digital humanities, offering tools for automatic annotation and interpretation of historical datasets. Despite its successes, the study also revealed significant limitations. Firstly, the model struggled to interpret abstract and allegorical imagery, which often requires contextual knowledge that goes beyond visual or textual inputs. Secondly, generated captions, while plausible, occasionally lacked the depth and specificity of expert analyses, particularly for highly nuanced works.
Lastly, the dataset’s Eurocentric focus limited the generalizability of findings to other cultural or historical contexts.
Addressing these challenges presents exciting opportunities for advancing the field. Firstly, incorporate graphic images and textual descriptions from non-European cultures and periods, such as Islamic scientific illustrations, East Asian woodblock prints, or Pre-Columbian art. This would enhance the model’s generalization capabilities and cultural inclusivity. Secondly,
develop hybrid models that combine multimodal AI with symbolic reasoning frameworks, such as knowledge graphs, to enable deeper interpretation of allegorical and abstract imagery. Thirdly, extend the textual preprocessing pipeline to include original languages (e.g., Latin, Italian, Greek) alongside translations, enabling the model to preserve linguistic nuances and historical authenticity. Fourthly, improve the model’s ability to differentiate between substyles within the Renaissance, such as the Gothic-inspired elements of Northern Europe or the humanist innovations of Italy. Fifthly, explore the integration of MLMs into interactive platforms, such as virtual museum tours or AI-powered learning applications. By presenting historical insights dynamically, such tools could engage broader audiences. Lastly,
investigate the model’s adaptability to other historical periods, such as the Baroque or Enlightenment, to establish its versatility across diverse artistic and scientific traditions.

By advancing these areas, multimodal AI can serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary innovation, reshaping how we engage with and interpret the cultural artifacts of the past. Through continued collaboration between AI researchers and historians, this technology holds the promise of democratizing access to historical knowledge while preserving its richness for future generations.
