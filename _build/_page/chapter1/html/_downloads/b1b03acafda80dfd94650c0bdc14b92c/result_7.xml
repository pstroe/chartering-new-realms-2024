I'll help you adapt the given text in a way that's easy to understand.

The raw text is about a Bill, or law, aimed at harmonizing the statutory provisions regulating public entities in South Africa. Here's an adapted version:

 <seg xml:lang="en">The Department is responsible for developing, coordinating and managing the system of innovation together with the eight entities. However, 23 years after the promulgation of the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology and following a number of reviews of the national system of innovation in the 1996 White Paper, including the recent approval by Cabinet of a new White Paper on Science and Technology and Innovation in March 2019, the various reviews of the National System of Innovation, NSI, and the White Paper show that despite significant progress, challenges remain in attaining the ideal in the 1996 White Paper.</seg>

 <seg xml:lang="en">Now, a notable observation from the 2016/17 research and experimental development survey show that higher education sector was the largest contributed to the overall increase in the gross expenditure on research and development of UNREVISED HANSARD NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TUESDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 2020 Page: 14 R827 million in constant 2010 values.</seg>

<p>
 <note type="speaker"><u xml:id="25-02-2020_u16" who="#ChiefWhipOfMajorityParty"></u><seg xml:lang="en">The higher education sector contributed an amount of 790 to the increase in research and development. The research and development in the business sector increased by only 0.2% with State-owned enterprises, SOEs, contributing R365 million which is calculated in constant 2010 values to this.</seg></note>

 <seg xml:lang="en">The private that is business sector excluding the SOEs showed a decrease in research and development expenditure in constant 2010 values. The government sector decreased by 2.4%, whereas the science sector showed a marginal growth.</seg>
