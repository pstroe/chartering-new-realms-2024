    "Scholars spend many hours on preprocessing raw data into structured collections that suit their needs {cite:p}`chen_2023`. This process is time and resource intensive, especially when dealing with natural language. Considering the current trend in the digital humanities away from big data towards massive data, the questions of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable {cite:p}`wilkinson_2016` have become a focus area of constructing data collections {cite:p}`ide_2003, könig_2021`. An attempt at making data findable, accessible, interoprable, and reusable can be found in the Text Encoding Initiative, TEI {cite:p}`burnard_2013`. In this chapter, we propose an approach to the construction of structured data collections with the assistance of Large Language Models, LLMs, to reduce the amount of human labour invested in preprocessing, using the ParlaMint schema, an interoperable TEI XML schema for transcripts of parliamentary proceedings. This approach could be promising in cases where there is much raw data but it is not accessible in any coherent structure, as is the case, for example, for the variations of South African English {cite:p}`barnard_2014, jeffery_2003, pienaar_2011`. One such source of raw data are the South African parliamentary proceedings. The South African Parliament supplies transcripts of its parliamentary proceedings online, and whilst attempts have been made to structure this data into the ParliMint schema, the attempt has been labour-intensive and performed on a small scale {cite:p}`ogrodniczuk_2024`. This chapter shall thus attempt to propose an approach to format the parliamentary proceedings into an interoperable XML schema, by employing the aid of different LLMs without the use of industrial strength hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant Literature \n",
    ">Parliamentary proceedings (PP) are a rich source of data used by e.g. scholars in historiography, sociology, political science, linguistics, economics and economic history. As opposed to sources of most other language corpora, PP are not subject to copyright or personal privacy protections, and are typically available online thus making them ideal for compilation into corpora and open distribution. For these reasons many countries have already produced PP corpora, but each typically in their own encoding, thus limiting their comparability and utilisation in a multilingual setting.\n",
    ">{cite:p}`erjavec_2019`\n",
    "\n",
    "ParlaMint was invented as an interoperable, adaptive framework of formatting non-standardised parliamentary proceedings {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`. A first attempt at including the South African Parliamentary Proceedings has been made by Ogrodniczuk {cite:t}`ogrodniczuk_2024`, highlighting again the difficulties of formatting an unstructed document into the ParlaMint scheme {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`. The experiment was conducted on a singular session with a rule based approach {cite:p}`ogrodniczuk_2024`. This proved difficult as all kinesic categories, which denotes descriptions of behaviour such as clapping and is transcriped in the transcripts, had to be marked manually, thus making it a labour intensive process when considering the 25 years of proceedings available for download on [the website of the South African Parliament](https://www.parliament.gov.za/hansard) {cite:p}`ogrodniczuk_2024, truan_2021`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This difficulty of the rule-based approach raised the question of whether LLMs could be harnessed to format the data. The primary attractivity of harnessing LLMs lies in their capability to process natural language inputs and their generalized applicability to unknown tasks {cite:p}`zhang_jellyfish_2024, narayan_2022`. In this they are more flexible than specialized tools. Their flexibility is especially appreciated when it comes to the robustness of processing as, because they are not rule based, they are able to adapt to unforseen circumstances {cite:p}`zhang_jellyfish_2024`. In this ability they have found a wide application ground within the field of linguistics such as in Zappavigna where ChatGPT was tasked with evaluating noisy social media data {cite:p}`zappavigna_2023`, extracting data points from unstructured documents {cite:p}`vijayan_2023`, or in the use of generative LLMs for corpus analysis {cite:p}`curry_2024`. As to the knowledge of the authors of this chapter, no attempts at harnessing LLMs for parliamentary corpus building specifically have been attempted. However, in the wider field of data curation and formatting, the capabilities of LLMs are utilized, for example in summarising healthcare data from semi-structured forms into possible schematas of illnesses {cite:p}`letinier_2021` or in processing natural language for the biomedical field into a reusable format {cite:p}`beck_2022`. These adaptations of LLMs are highly specialized to their respective tasks and have thus lost much of their generality which is so desired by data scientists in their quest for a one-stop-shop solution for data wrangling {cite:p}`chen_2023`. A further issue of these specialized tasks lie in the idea that LLMs also mark faulty data, or rather correct these errors, such as in customer databases {cite:p}`pookandy_2022`. A behaviour which, in the field of linguistics, is at its best irrelevant but rather more likely renders the data worthless as it would alter the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of these added difficulties when it comes to language data, where the language itself is of importance rather than data points, research has largely been based on developping a tool that, in its foundations, is based on LLMs but that also includes code with a rule-based approach to wrangle data {cite:p}`chen_2023, arora_2023`. Evaporate is capable of transforming various, semistructured inputs into a table output, its LLM components are based on using cloud solutions to run LLMs {cite:p}`arora_2023`. SEED works on a similar basis, though its output format can be customised [^footnote1]. A model specifically fine-tuned for dataprocessing is the jellyfish family [^footnote4], as proposed by Zhang et al. which is based on the smaller models of the Llama 3 family {cite:t}`zhang_jellyfish_2024`. These tools display a remarkable adaptivity to new tasks, especially when employing few-shot prompting, where a model or tool is supplied with several examples before it is set to the task {cite:p}`chen_2023`. However, this comes at a greater computational cost than when employing rule-based tools {cite:p}`arora_2023`. Considering this trade-off between robustness, human-costliness and energy-efficiency, any approach must be carefully calculated and balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^footnote4]: The Jellyfish model requires a GPU with more than 15 GB of memory, we neither have a device available with such a GPU, nor does Google Colab support such memory use on their free plan, thus we are unable to include it in our tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^footnote1]: SEED is currently undergoing restructuring and thus cannot be used. It seems to be a promising project for further investigation into processing raw data via LLM, see [SEED repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SEED/paper.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data was extracted from the official website for the Hansard of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. The Hansard constitutes the transcripts of the mini plenary sessions of the National Assembly, the National Council of Provinces, the National Assembly, and any joint sessions. The National Assembly is formed by 400 members from the various South African political parties. The National Assembly is elected by the voting population of South Africa. The National Council of Provinces, NCoP, is formed with 90 provincial delegates which translates to 10 delegates for each province. It is thus composed regardless of population distribution. The NCoP is chosen by the provincial legislatures {cite:t}`piombo_2005`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reports are majoritatively held in English, though when a speaker chooses to use another official language, it is transcribed and no English translation is given. \"Hansard is a substantially verbatim report - with repetitions and redundancies omitted and obvious mistakes corrected - of parliamentary proceedings\" (see [Website of the South African parliament](https://www.parliament.gov.za/hansard?sorts[language]=-1&page=5&offset=40)). Kotze and Van Rooy remark that it is, and remains unclear what substantially verbatim conotes in the sense of corrections towards an overstandardisation {cite:p}`kotze_2020, hibbert_2016, hibbert_2003`.[^footnote2] \n",
    "\n",
    "[^footnote2]: For a more detailed discussion of editing practices in the South African Hansard view {cite:p}`hibbert_2016, hibbert_2003`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision was made to process a randomly selected transcript from the National Assembly, henceforth abbreviated NA, to assess whether the proposed approach is feasible, thus following the methodology of Ogrodniczuk {cite:t}`ogrodniczuk_2024`. The data thus excludes any other years, all joint sittings, all meetings of the NCoP and all mini plenary sessions, however the formatting for all of these transcripts follows the approximate same standards as those of the NA. The session selected was from the 25th of February 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ParlaMint \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the data in this corpus remains both human- and machine-readable while adhering to widely accepted standards, it was decided to encode the transcriptions in XML using the ParlaMint schema {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`, a customisation of the Parla-Clarina schema, which itself is based on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines {cite:p}`tei_consortium_guidelines`. This approach allows the corpus to maintain a consistent structure while also providing a way to encode the specific nuances of parliamentary discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to adopt TEI, and specifically the ParlaMint schema, was guided by several considerations, specifically the goal of adhering to the FAIR principles. TEI's flexibility allows for the encoding of a diverse range of textual features, including but not limited to metadata about speakers. The ParlaMint schema, as a specialized extension of TEI, was designed to standardise the encoding of parliamentary data across various languages and regions {cite:p}`ogrodniczuk_2024` and allows for the encoding of a wide variety of metadata while following a strict structure to enable maximal interoperability {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`. In addition to the strict encoding guidelines for data and metadata provided by the ParlaMint schema, it also allows for meticulous documentation of the process to enable reusability for future research using this data. Overall, the ParlaMint was designed to adhere to the FAIR principles as closely as possible {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concluded ParlaMint I project entailed the encoding of corpora containing transcriptions of the sessions of 17 European national parliaments, resulting in a collection of half a billion words {cite:p}`erjavec_2022_TEI`. Each corpus was prepared in two versions, one being the fully marked-up corpus with speeches in plain text, the other being identical to the first but with added linguistic annotation {cite:p}`erjavec_2023`. Adhering to the ParlaMint schema while encoding the South African Hansard papers would allow this corpus to seamlessly integrate with the ParlaMint I project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ParlaMint corpus is contained within a teiCorpus element, which includes a teiHeader for overarching metadata and multiple TEI elements, each representing a distinct component of the corpus, typically corresponding to a single day's transcripts. This corpus root encodes information such as the title and language of the corresponding transcripts, the number of speakers and speeches contained within them, and the time the transcriptions span. The corpus root file also contains information about the license the transcripts are published under and the place online where they can be downloaded. \n",
    "To manage large corpora more easily, ParlaMint uses the XInclude mechanism. In this setup, the main corpus file, called the corpus root, references individual files, the corpus component files. Thus, each day's transcripts are stored in a separate file, with the overarching structure being represented in the corpus root. This approach facilitates scalability and makes the corpus more easy to maintain. {cite:p}`ParlaMint_2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gold Standard\n",
    "The preprocessing of the transcriptions involved several steps to ensure consistency and compliance with the ParlaMint schema. This included turning the PDF-document downloaded from the South African parliament's website {cite:p}`hansardSA_2020` into a TXT file. The content of this TXT file was not edited, save for occasional spelling errors within headers and subtitles. This TXT file was then converted to an XML file manually.\n",

    "This chapter uses the newest releases of the Llama 3 model family, Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o. \n",
    "\n",
    "Llama makes multiple sets of pretrained models with different quantities of parameters available, thus, offering the possibility of maximising minimal parameter count to maximum quality output thus possibly minimizing the costliness of the running of such models. Whilst there is an effort to optimize models, it is still not possible to train a LLM locally on a standard laptop {cite:p}`zhang_jellyfish_2024`. However, it is possible to run some pretrained models locally, provided that their parameter count is relatively small, and adapt them to a specific task via prompting. In this context Llama offers small-scale options with their development of the general models Llama 3.2 1B, 3B, 8B and 70B, where especially the 1B and the 3B parameter models are runnable on mobile or edge devices {cite:p}`dubey_2024`. The smaller models are \"best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with similar numbers of parameters\" {cite:p}`dubey_2024`. However, these smaller models come at a reduction of processing power, which may cause difficulties in processing the complex ParlaMint structure. \n",

    "Another model utilised was Gemini 1.5 Flash. Gemini 1.5 Flash constitutes the attempt at constructing a lightweight model with GPT-4 capabilities but a longer context window {cite:p}`gemini_2024`. It promises accuracy across a context window of 10 million token, whilst being relatively efficient and more efficient to serve then the Gemini 1.0 models {cite:p}`gemini_2024`, thus making it a promising candidate for formatting data as, especially in the case of ParlaMint, the complete context of the correct XML structure is relatively long.  \n",

    "GPT-4o was chosen for its accessibility, computational efficiency, and ease of use. Unlike larger, resource-intensive models, GPT-4o offers advanced capabilities while remaining efficient to run on standard hardware. Additionally, OpenAI announced in a press conference that GPT-4o demonstrates significant advancements in linguistic, textual, and visual reasoning task {cite:p}`liu_2024`.\n",

This approach was chosen to assess whether a smaller, and thus less costly, LLM could fulfill the task requirements. Furthermore, two larger LLMs, Gemini and GPT-4o, were tested through their online chat interface, to assess whether they produce a different, possibly a more stable output. \n",

The decision to utilize a standard prompting approach for the Llama herd was made to accomodate the context windows of the models tested. To work with the context window given, the files had to be chunked. The decision was made not to enlargen the context windows as larger context windows generally amplify hallucinations, which in the case of data formatting would be detrimental.\n",

    "To assess whether a larger LLM gives a better output, Gemini 1.5 Flash was tested in its online chat interface. Gemini's primary attractiveness for this task lies in its long context windows of up to 10 million token and its superior efficiency over the GPT models {cite:p}`gemini_2024`. As the online chat interface does not allow file input, the prompt was structured to contain both an example xml and an example txt, as well as a chunk of a file to be processed. See below for an example of the structure. The file was chunked into 4000 word segments to respect the input maximum of 5108 tokens of each call for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Every conversation was held thrice to assess the answer scheme of the LLM and whether it's answers are similar in content. \n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "As pretrained LLMs show difficulties when modelling data into complex formats such as the ParlaMint, further research is necessary on whether tools such as Evaporate or SEED, which are partially rulebased, can be adapted better to the task {cite:p}`aorora_2023, chen_2023`. A different approach could lie in accessing stronger hardware through cloud computing platforms such as google colab to run models such as Jellyfish which are specialized on the task of formatting data {cite:p}`zhang_jellyfish_2024`. It might also be possible to fine-tune a model with a currated dataset from the ParlaMint corpus to create a custom model specifically atuned to formatting data into the ParlaMint schema. Furthermore, different prompting approaches might show more fruitful (see {cite:t}`sahoo_2024` for an overview of prompt engineering techniques).\n",
