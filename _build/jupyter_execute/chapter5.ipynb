    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Religious texts, serving as foundational pillars of spiritual and cultural guidance, have shaped societies and personal belief systems for centuries. Yet, each new translation of these texts is not merely an act of linguistic substitution; it brings nuanced shifts that mirror changes in language, culture, and society. This chapter explores how these incremental adjustments in translation can influence readers' theological understanding, subtly reshaping interpretations of key ideas over time. By tracing these shifts, we aim to uncover the evolving theological perspectives embedded within different English translations, shedding light on how scripture adapts to and reflects its socio-historical context.\n",
    "Religious texts like the Bible are among the most frequently translated works globally, with each version inevitably influenced by the translator's language, cultural context, and theological outlook. While translation aims to stay true to the original text, it often involves interpretive choices shaped by the translator's beliefs or the prevailing religious and linguistic norms of the time. This study therefore addresses a key question: How have major English Bible translations, over centuries, reflected and contributed to shifts in theological focus?\n",
    "Through advanced text mining techniques, we systematically examine thematic patterns, keywords, and topics within pivotal English Bible translations spanning over four centuries, including Douay-Rheims (1582, 1601&1610), the King James Version (1611), World English Bible (2000), and Open English Bible (2010). This temporal range allows for the analysis of continuity and change in theological emphasis, tracking shifts that may align with or respond to historical events, doctrinal developments, and societal transformations.\n",
    "To achieve this, we use computational methods in text mining to capture thematic and linguistic changes across these translations. Techniques such as topic modeling, frequency analysis, and keyword comparison enable us to detect subtle yet meaningful changes that may not be immediately apparent in a qualitative review. For instance, we anticipate that terms emphasizing divine authority, morality, or human agency might reveal shifting focal points in theological interpretation. By mapping these changes, this analysis provides empirical evidence of the interplay between scriptural content and the contexts in which these texts were reinterpreted.\n",
    "Through this comparative, computational lens, our study aims to offer a novel perspective on the evolution of religious translation and its impact on theological discourse. This research not only contributes to the fields of computational linguistics and digital humanities but also invites reflection on the broader cultural implications of religious translation, as language remains a living medium through which faith, values, and beliefs are continually reshaped.\n",

    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we focus on tracing theological shifts over time by examining four different Bible versions based on criteria such as comparability and accessability, i.e., being open source: the King James Version (KJV), Douay-Rheims Version (DRV), World English Bible (WEB), and Open English Bible (OEB). We chose these translations to give a balanced view of how language and interpretation have evolved, reflecting changes in theological emphasis, linguistic style, and translation philosophy over the centuries. Together, these versions allow us to explore how translation choices can shape the way people understand and connect with biblical texts.\n",
    " \n",
    "The King James Version (KJV), Douay-Rheims Version (DRV), World English Bible (WEB), and Open English Bible (OEB) each offer a unique approach to translating the Bible, and they highlight how language and interpretation have changed over time. Each translation was created with different goals and priorities, which affect how we read and understand the text. The KJV, published in 1611, is known for its formal, poetic language and is based on manuscripts called the Textus Receptus. It has been very influential in shaping English-speaking Christianity. The DRV, published in 1582 (New Testament) and 1610 (Old Testament) and translated from the Latin Vulgate, is the Catholic counterpart and has a similar formal style (Britannica). On the other hand, the WEB and OEB are modern translations. The WEB updates the language of the [American Standard Version](https://ebible.org/eng-web/webfaq.htm#WhatRevision), which is based on the KJV, to make it easier to read , while the [OEB](https://openenglishbible.org/faq/) uses simple, everyday language to make the Bible more accessible to a wider audience . Together, these four translations let us see how biblical language has evolved and how translation choices influence how people connect with the text.\n",
    "One big difference among these versions is how they handle language and readability. The KJV and DRV use older, more complex English, which can be hard for modern readers to understand."

    "The WEB keeps the same basic structure as the KJV but modernizes the language to make it clearer. Meanwhile, the OEB focuses on being as readable as possible, using simple and straightforward language. To illustrate this, in Psalm 23:1, the KJV says, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,” which uses an older way of saying that God provides everything we need. The OEB translates this as, “The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need,” which is much clearer for today’s readers. These differences show how translations can make the text more or less accessible, depending on the language they use (citation??).\n",
    "Theological emphasis is another important area where these translations differ. The [DRV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Douay-Rheims-1899-American-Edition-DRA-Bible/) was translated from the Latin Vulgate and reflects Catholic beliefs , while the [KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/King-James-Version-KJV-Bible/) comes from the Protestant tradition and has its own way of highlighting certain theological ideas . The WEB and OEB, being more modern and neutral, try to appeal to a broader audience. They avoid some of the theological specifics you find in the older translations. For instance, in Matthew 6:11, the DRV says, “Give us this day our supersubstantial bread,” which ties into Catholic teachings about the Eucharist. The KJV uses the simpler phrase “daily bread,” and the OEB goes even further, translating it as “the food we need for today,” which focuses on the practical meaning rather than theological implications. These differences show how translation choices can subtly influence how readers interpret theological concepts.\n",
    "The sources used for these translations also affect how they read. The KJV is based on the Textus Receptus, which was the best manuscript source available during the Reformation (Britannica), while the [DRV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Douay-Rheims-1899-American-Edition-DRA-Bible/) comes from the Latin Vulgate, the official Bible of the Catholic Church . The WEB and OEB, however, use more recent and diverse manuscript sources. This can lead to differences in how certain passages are presented. A good example is 1 John 5:7–8. The KJV includes a Trinitarian phrase that’s missing from most early Greek manuscripts but is present in the Textus Receptus. The OEB and WEB, which use critical editions of the Bible based on older manuscripts, leave this phrase out. These differences highlight how the manuscripts chosen for a translation can influence the final text, especially in areas with theological significance.\n",
    "Finally, the translation philosophy behind each version affects how they communicate the original message. The KJV, DRV, and WEB all use a formal, word-for-word approach, which tries to stay as close to the original language as possible. This method often preserves the structure and vocabulary of the original texts but can be harder to read today. The OEB, on the other hand, uses a more dynamic approach, translating the meaning of each passage into natural, modern English. This makes the text easier to understand but can sometimes lose the feel of the original. In Philippians 4:13, for example, the KJV says, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me,” which is quite close to the original Greek wording. The OEB simplifies this to, “I can find strength for anything through him who gives me strength,” which is more relatable for modern readers. These different approaches show how translations can either stick closely to the original or make the text easier to read, and each choice affects how people connect with the Bible.\n",
    "In summary, the KJV, DRV, WEB, and OEB give us a wide view of how Bible translation has changed over time. The older translations like the KJV and DRV emphasize tradition and formal language, while the WEB and OEB aim to make the text clearer and more understandable for today’s readers. Comparing these versions reveals how language, theology, and translation methods all work together to shape how we experience and interpret the Bible."
