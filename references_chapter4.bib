Similarly, the construction of co-occurrence networks of literary characters, and their analysis using methods from social network analysis and network science, have provided insights into the micro- and macro-level structure of literary texts. Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien's works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method. Our results highlight the large potential of graph learning in Computational Literary Studies.},

  abstract = {How does a literary historian end up thinking in terms of z-scores, principal component analysis, and clustering coefficients? The 10 essays in Distant Reading led to a new and often contested paradigm of literary analysis. In presenting them here Franco Moretti reconstructs his intellectual trajectory, the theoretical influences over his work, and explores the polemics that have often developed around his positions. From the evolutionary model of 'Modern European Literature', through the geo-cultural insights of 'Conjectures on World Literature' and 'Planet Hollywood' to the quantitative findings of 'Style, inc.' and the abstract patterns of 'Network Theory, Plot Analysis', the book follows two decades of critical explorations that have come to define--well beyond the wildest expectations of its author--a growing field of unorthodox literary studies},

	abstract = {A character network is a graph extracted from a narrative in which vertices represent characters and edges correspond to interactions between them. A number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role detection. Character networks are particularly relevant when considering works of fiction (e.g., novels, plays, movies, TV series), as their exploitation allows developing information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, works of fiction possess specific properties that make these tasks harder.This survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way and explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations of the existing approaches and the most promising perspectives.},
