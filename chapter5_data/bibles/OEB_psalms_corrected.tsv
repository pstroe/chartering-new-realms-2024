Book	Chapter	Verse	Text
Psalms	1	1	Happy are those who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, not halting in ways frequented by sinners, nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
Psalms	1	2	But the law of the LORD  is their joy, they study it day and night.
Psalms	1	3	They are like trees planted by runlets of water, yielding fruit in due season, leaves never fading. In all that they do, they prosper.
Psalms	1	4	Not so fare the wicked, not so; like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
Psalms	1	5	So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
Psalms	1	6	For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD, but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.
Psalms	2	1	Why this turmoil of nations, this futile plotting of peoples,
Psalms	2	2	with kings of the earth conspiring, and rulers consulting together, against the LORD  and against his anointed,
Psalms	2	3	to snap their bonds and fling their cords away?
Psalms	2	4	He whose throne is in heaven laughs, the LORD  mocks them.
Psalms	2	5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his hot anger confounds them.
Psalms	2	6	“This my king is installed by me, on Zion my holy mountain.”
Psalms	2	7	I will tell of the LORD ’s decree. He said to me: “You are my son, this day I became your father.
Psalms	2	8	Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
Psalms	2	9	You will break them with sceptre of iron, shatter them like pottery.”
Psalms	2	10	So now, you kings, be wise: be warned, you rulers of earth.
Psalms	2	11	Serve the LORD  in awe, kiss his feet with trembling,
Psalms	2	12	lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; for soon will his fury blaze. Happy all who take refuge in him.
Psalms	3	1	How many, LORD, are my foes! Those who rise up against me are many.
Psalms	3	2	Many are those who say of me, “There is no help for him in his God.” *Selah*
Psalms	3	3	But you, LORD, are shield about me, my glory, who lifts up my head.
Psalms	3	4	When loudly I call to the LORD, from his holy hill he gives answer. *Selah*
Psalms	3	5	I laid down and slept: now I wake, for the LORD  sustains me.

Psalms	3	8	Victory belongs to the LORD : let your blessing descend on your people. *Selah*
Psalms	4	1	Answer my cry, God, my defender. Often from straits you have brought me to spacious places. So now show me your favor and hear my prayer.
Psalms	4	2	How long, you proud people, will my honor be stained by the slanders you love, and the lies that you follow? *Selah*
Psalms	4	3	See! The LORD  has shown me his wonderful kindness: the LORD  hears, when I call to him.
Psalms	4	4	Sin not in your anger: but speak in your heart on your bed, and be still. *Selah*

Psalms	5	1	Hear my words, LORD : give heed to my whisper.
Psalms	5	2	Attend to my loud cry for help, my king and my God.
Psalms	5	3	When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning, hear my voice. I make ready for you in the morning, and look for a sign.
Psalms	5	4	For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: no one of evil can be your guest.
Psalms	5	5	No braggarts can stand in your presence, you hate all workers of wrong.
Psalms	5	6	You destroy all speakers of lies, people of blood and deceit you abhor.
Psalms	5	7	But I, through your kindness abundant, may enter your house, and towards the shrine of your temple may reverently bow.
Psalms	5	8	Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way level before me.
Psalms	5	9	For their mouth is a stranger to truth, their heart is a pit of destruction. Their throat is a wide open grave, their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.
Psalms	5	10	Condemn them, God; let their schemes bring them down to the ground. For their numberless crimes thrust them down for playing the rebel against you.
Psalms	5	11	But let all who take refuge in you ring out their gladness forever. Protect those who love your name, so they may exult in you.
Psalms	5	12	For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly, and the shield of your favor protects them.
Psalms	6	1	Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger, punish me not in your wrath.
Psalms	6	2	LORD, be gracious to me in my weakness. Heal me LORD, for racked is my body;
Psalms	6	3	all of me utterly racked. Why do you wait so long, LORD ?
Psalms	6	4	Turn, LORD, rescue me; save me, because of your love.
Psalms	6	5	For in death none can call you to mind; in Sheol who can praise you?
Psalms	6	6	I am so weary of sighing. All the night I make my bed swim, and wet my couch with my tears.
Psalms	6	7	My eyes swollen with grief; from weeping caused by my foes.
Psalms	6	8	Begone, workers of wrong, for the LORD  has heard my loud weeping,
Psalms	6	9	the LORD  has heard my entreaty, the LORD  accepts my prayer.
Psalms	6	10	My foes will be stricken with terror, brought to shame and dismay in a moment.
Psalms	7	1	LORD  my God, I take refuge in you. Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
Psalms	7	2	or like lions they will tear me to pieces, and rend me, past hope of rescue.
Psalms	7	3	LORD, my God, if my life has been such if my hands have been stained with guilt,
Psalms	7	4	if friends I paid back with evil, if I plundered my foes without cause,
Psalms	7	5	may the enemy chase and find me, trample my life to the ground, my honor leave in the dirt! *Selah*
Psalms	7	6	Arise, LORD, in anger, against my foes rise in fury. Awake for my help: let justice be done.
Psalms	7	7	Gather the nations about you, and sit on your lofty throne,
Psalms	7	8	as the LORD, the judge of the peoples. Judge me, LORD, in my innocence and according to my integrity.

Psalms	7	10	God is my shield: he saves the upright in heart.

Psalms	7	12	He will sharpen his sword without fail, his bow is bent and ready,
Psalms	7	13	his deadly weapons are ready, his arrows he makes of flame.
Psalms	7	14	The enemy who conceives evil; pregnant with mischief, giving birth to lies,
Psalms	7	15	a pit they have made and dug; but into the hole that they made they will fall.
Psalms	7	16	On their own heads their mischief comes back; on their own skulls their violence comes down.
Psalms	7	17	I will give thanks to the LORD  for his justice, and sing to the name of the LORD  Most High.
Psalms	8	1	LORD  our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name! Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
Psalms	8	2	from the mouths of children and infants.  You have built a fortress against your enemies, to silence the foe and the rebel.
Psalms	8	3	When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set there,
Psalms	8	4	what are mortals, that you think of them, humans, that you visit them?
Psalms	8	5	Yet you made them little less than divine, crowned them with glory and majesty,
Psalms	8	6	made them lord of the works of your hands, put all things under their feet –
Psalms	8	7	sheep and oxen, all of them; and the wild beasts also:
Psalms	8	8	birds of the air, and fish of the sea, and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
Psalms	8	9	LORD  our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name!
Psalms	9	1	With all my heart I will praise the LORD, all your wonders I will rehearse.
Psalms	9	2	I will rejoice and exult in you, singing praise to your name, Most High;
Psalms	9	3	because backward my foes were turned, they stumbled and perished before you.
Psalms	9	4	My right and my claim you have upheld, you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
Psalms	9	5	rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked, and blotting their name out forever and ever.
Psalms	9	6	The foe is vanished, ruined forever, their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
Psalms	9	7	See! The LORD  is seated forever on the throne he established for judgment,
Psalms	9	8	ruling the world with justice, and judging the nations with equity.
Psalms	9	9	So the LORD  proves a haven to the oppressed, a haven in times of trouble.
Psalms	9	10	Well may they trust you who know your name, for those who seek you, you never abandon.
Psalms	9	11	Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion, declare his deeds among the nations.
Psalms	9	12	As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind, he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
Psalms	9	13	Show me favor, LORD, see how my foes afflict me, lift me up from the gates of death;

Psalms	9	15	The nations are sunk in the pit which they made, in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
Psalms	9	16	The LORD  is revealed in the judgment he wrought, the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. *Selah*
Psalms	9	17	Let the wicked depart to Sheol, all the nations that live forgetful of God.

Psalms	9	19	Arise, LORD ; don’t let them triumph: before your face let the nations be judged.
Psalms	9	20	Strike them with fear, LORD : show the nations how frail they are. *Selah*
Psalms	10	1	Why do you stand, LORD, so far away, hiding yourself in times of trouble?
Psalms	10	2	The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless: let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.
Psalms	10	3	For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed; the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,
Psalms	10	4	in wicked pride, thinks: God doesn’t care, God doesn’t call to account.
Psalms	10	5	Never a season that they do not prosper; your judgments are far above out of their sight: they scoff at their foes.
Psalms	10	6	Each says in their heart, “I will never be shaken; I will live for all time untouched by misfortune.”
Psalms	10	7	Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression: under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.
Psalms	10	8	Lying in secret in some village ambush, and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
Psalms	10	9	Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair they lurk intending to catch the defenceless; to seize them, to drag them away in their net.
Psalms	10	10	Their victims are crushed, sink down to the ground. Under their claws the hapless fall.
Psalms	10	11	The wicked say in their hearts that God has forgotten, has hidden his face, will see nothing.
Psalms	10	12	Arise, LORD, lift up your hand, do not forget the cry of the wretched.
Psalms	10	13	Why do the wicked treat God with contempt, and say in their hearts, “God doesn’t care”?
Psalms	10	14	You have seen the trouble and sorrow; you mark it all, and will take it in hand. The hapless can count on you, helper of orphans.
Psalms	10	15	Break the arm of the wicked and evil: search out their sin, till no more be found.
Psalms	10	16	The LORD  is king forever and ever: the nations will vanish from his land.
Psalms	10	17	LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble, inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
Psalms	10	18	rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan, so no one on earth may strike terror again.
Psalms	11	1	In the LORD  I take refuge. How can you tell me to flee like a bird to the mountains?
Psalms	11	2	“See! The wicked are bending the bow, their arrow is set on the string, to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
Psalms	11	3	In this tearing down of foundations what good can a good person do?”
Psalms	11	4	The LORD  in his holy temple, the LORD  in heaven, enthroned. His eyes watch the world, they see everyone.
Psalms	11	5	The LORD  examines the righteous and wicked, and the lover of violence he hates.
Psalms	11	6	On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone, and their drink will be scorching wind.
Psalms	11	7	For the LORD  is just, and justice he loves; so the upright will see his face.
Psalms	12	1	Help, LORD, for the good are all gone, faithful people have vanished.
Psalms	12	2	One lies to another, speaking empty lies, with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.
Psalms	12	3	May the LORD  cut off all the flattering lips, and the tongue that utters arrogance,
Psalms	12	4	they declare, “Our tongue is our strength, our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”
Psalms	12	5	“The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing; so now I will act,” the LORD  declares “And place them in the safety they long for.”
Psalms	12	6	The words of the LORD  are words that are pure, silver smelted, seven times refined.
Psalms	12	7	You will keep us, LORD, and guard us from this generation forever,
Psalms	12	8	in a world where the wicked prowl, and worthless people exalted.
Psalms	13	1	How long, LORD, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
Psalms	13	2	How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?
Psalms	13	3	Look at me, answer me, LORD  my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death,
Psalms	13	4	lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
Psalms	13	5	But I trust in your kindness: my heart will rejoice in your help.
Psalms	13	6	I will sing to the LORD  who was good to me.
Psalms	14	1	Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
Psalms	14	2	From heaven the LORD  looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.
Psalms	14	3	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
Psalms	14	4	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD .
Psalms	14	5	Sore afraid will they be; for God is among those who are righteous,
Psalms	14	6	you may mock the plans of the poor, but the LORD  is their refuge.
Psalms	14	7	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When the LORD  brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
Psalms	15	1	LORD, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?
Psalms	15	2	The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere;
Psalms	15	3	on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend,
Psalms	15	4	nor cruelly insult a neighbor, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honors those who obey the LORD, who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
Psalms	15	5	whose money is lent without interest, and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.  The person who does these things will always stand firm.
Psalms	16	1	Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
Psalms	16	2	I said to the LORD, “You are my LORD, my happiness rests in you alone.
Psalms	16	3	Those who are holy in the land, they, they alone, are the noble ones; all my delight is in them.”
Psalms	16	4	Those who choose other gods find endless sorrow. In their offerings of blood I will have no part nor take their name on my lips.
Psalms	16	5	The LORD  is my share and my portion, my fate is in your strong hands.
Psalms	16	6	The boundary lines of my life mark out delightful country, my heritage pleases me well.
Psalms	16	7	I praise the LORD  for his counsel, which so stirs my heart in the night.
Psalms	16	8	I keep the LORD  always in mind: with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
Psalms	16	9	So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me; and in safety of body I live.
Psalms	16	10	For you will not give me up to Sheol nor let any who love you see the pit.
Psalms	16	11	You will show me the path that leads to life, to that fulness of joy which is in your presence, and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.
Psalms	17	1	Listen, O LORD, to my innocence; attend to my piercing cry. Give heed to my prayer out of lips unfeigned.
Psalms	17	2	Let my vindication come from you, your eyes see the truth.
Psalms	17	3	When you test my heart when you visit at night, and assay me like silver – you can find no evil. I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
Psalms	17	4	I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
Psalms	17	5	My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
Psalms	17	6	So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
Psalms	17	7	Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemies those who take refuge at your right hand.
Psalms	17	8	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shelter of your wings.
Psalms	17	9	From wicked people who do me violence, from deadly foes who crowd around me.
Psalms	17	10	They have closed their hearts to pity, the words of their mouths are haughty.
Psalms	17	11	Now they dog us at every step, keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
Psalms	17	12	like a lion, longing to tear, like a young lion, lurking in secret.
Psalms	17	13	Arise, LORD, face them and fell them. By your sword set me free from the wicked,
Psalms	17	14	by your hand, O LORD, from those – whose portion of life is but of this world. But let your treasured ones have food in plenty may their children be full and their children satisfied.
Psalms	17	15	In my innocence I will see your face, awake I am filled with a vision of you.
Psalms	18	1	I love you, O LORD, my strength.
Psalms	18	2	The LORD  is my rock, my fortress, deliverer, my God, my rock, where I take refuge, my shield, my defender, my tower.
Psalms	18	3	Worthy of praise is the LORD  whom I call on, he rescues me from all my foes.
Psalms	18	4	The waves of death broke about me, fearful floods of chaos.
Psalms	18	5	Sheol threw cords around me, snares of death came to meet me.
Psalms	18	6	In distress I cried to the LORD, and shouted for help to my God; in his temple he heard my voice, into his ears came my cry.
Psalms	18	7	Then the earth shook and quaked, mountains trembled to their foundations, and quaked because of his wrath.
Psalms	18	8	Smoke went up from his nostrils, devouring fire from his mouth, coals were kindled by it.
Psalms	18	9	Then he bent the sky and came down, thick darkness was under his feet.
Psalms	18	10	He rode on a cherub and flew, darting on wings of wind,
Psalms	18	11	with his screen of darkness about him, in thick dark clouds of water.
Psalms	18	12	At the radiance before him there passed hailstones and coals of fire.
Psalms	18	13	The LORD  thundered from heaven, the Most High uttered his voice.
Psalms	18	14	He shot his arrows and scattered them, flashed lightnings, and routed them.
Psalms	18	15	The channels of the sea were revealed, the world was laid bare to its base, at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
Psalms	18	16	He stretched from on high, he seized me, drew me up from the mighty waters,
Psalms	18	17	and saved me from those who hated me – fierce foes, too mighty for me.
Psalms	18	18	In my day of distress they assailed me, but the LORD  proved my support.
Psalms	18	19	To a spacious place he brought me, and, for love of me, he saved me.
Psalms	18	20	The LORD  repays my innocence, he rewards my cleanness of hands.
Psalms	18	21	For I kept the ways of the LORD, nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
Psalms	18	22	His commandments were all before me, his statutes I put not away.
Psalms	18	23	And I was blameless before him, guarding myself from sin.
Psalms	18	24	So the LORD  repaid my innocence, my cleanness of hands in his sight.
Psalms	18	25	With the loyal you are loyal, and with the blameless blameless.
Psalms	18	26	With the pure you show yourself pure, but shrewd with the devious.
Psalms	18	27	For the lowly people you save, but haughty eyes you abase.
Psalms	18	28	You are my lamp, LORD, my God who enlightens my darkness.
Psalms	18	29	With you I can storm a rampart, with my God I can leap a wall.
Psalms	18	30	As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD  is pure. He is shield to all who take refuge in him.
Psalms	18	31	For who is God but the LORD ? And who is a rock but our God?
Psalms	18	32	The God who arms me with strength, who cleared and smoothed my way.
Psalms	18	33	He made my feet like hinds’ feet, and set me up on the heights.
Psalms	18	34	He taught my hands how to fight, and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.
Psalms	18	35	The shield of your help you gave me, your right hand supports me, you stoop down to make me great.
Psalms	18	36	In your strength I took giant strides, and my feet never slipped.
Psalms	18	37	So I chased the foe till I caught them, and turned not, till I made an end of them.
Psalms	18	38	I smashed them, they could not rise, they fell beneath my feet.
Psalms	18	39	You did arm me with strength for war, you did bow my assailants beneath me.
Psalms	18	40	You made my foes turn their back to me, and those who did hate me I finished.
Psalms	18	41	They cried for help, but none saved them; to the LORD, but he answered them not.
Psalms	18	42	I beat them like dust of the market-place, stamped them like mud of the streets.
Psalms	18	43	From the strife of the peoples you saved me, you made me head of the nations, peoples I knew not did serve me.
Psalms	18	44	On the instant they hear, they obey me, foreigners come to me cringing.
Psalms	18	45	Foreigners lose courage, and come out of their strongholds trembling.
Psalms	18	46	The LORD  is alive! Blest be my rock! Exalted be God, my protector!
Psalms	18	47	The God who gave me revenge, and brought down nations beneath me,
Psalms	18	48	who saved me from angry foes, and set me above my assailants, safe from the violent.
Psalms	18	49	For this I will praise you among the nations, making music, O LORD, to your name:
Psalms	18	50	for great triumphs he grants to his king, and faithful love he shows his anointed, to David and his seed evermore.
Psalms	19	1	The heavens declare God’s glory, the sky tells what his hands have done.
Psalms	19	2	Day tells it to day, night reveals it to night,
Psalms	19	3	without speaking, without words; without the sound of voices.
Psalms	19	4	But through all the world their voice carries their words to the ends of the earth.  He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
Psalms	19	5	it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber, it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
Psalms	19	6	From one end of the heavens it rises, and around it runs to the other, and nothing hides from its heat.  ##### In Praise of the Law #####
Psalms	19	7	The law of the LORD  is perfect, renewing life. The decrees of the LORD  are trusty, making the simple wise.
Psalms	19	8	The behests of the LORD  are right, rejoicing the heart. The command of the LORD  is pure, giving light to the eyes.
Psalms	19	9	The fear of the LORD  is clean, it endures forever. The LORD ’s judgments are true and right altogether.
Psalms	19	10	More precious are they than gold – than fine gold in plenty, and sweeter they are than honey, that drops from the comb.
Psalms	19	11	By them is your servant warned; who keeps them has rich reward.
Psalms	19	12	Who can know their flaws? Absolve me from those I know not.
Psalms	19	13	Keep your servant from wilful sins – from falling under their sway: then blameless and clear will I be from great offense.
Psalms	19	14	May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you, LORD, my rock and redeemer.
Psalms	20	1	The LORD  answer you in the day of distress, the name of the Jacob’s God protect you,
Psalms	20	2	sending you help from the temple, out of Zion supporting you.
Psalms	20	3	All your meal-offerings may he remember, your burnt-offerings look on with favor. *Selah*
Psalms	20	4	May he grant you your heart’s desire, and bring all your plans to pass.
Psalms	20	5	We will shout then for joy at your victory, and rejoice in the name of our God. May the LORD  grant your every request.
Psalms	20	6	Now I am sure that the LORD will help his anointed. From his temple in heaven he will answer by his mighty triumphant right hand.
Psalms	20	7	Some in chariots are strong, some in horses; but our strength is the LORD  our God.
Psalms	20	8	They will totter and fall, while we rise and stand firm.
Psalms	20	9	Give victory, LORD, to the king, and answer us when we call.
Psalms	21	1	The king rejoices, LORD, in your might, how he exults because of your help!
Psalms	21	2	You have granted to him his heart’s desire, you have not withheld his lips’ request. *Selah*
Psalms	21	3	You came to meet him with rich blessings, you set on his head a golden crown.
Psalms	21	4	He asked you for life, you gave it – many long days, forever and ever.
Psalms	21	5	Great is his glory because of your help, honor and majesty you lay upon him.
Psalms	21	6	For you make him most blessed forever, you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
Psalms	21	7	For the king puts always his trust in the LORD ; the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
Psalms	21	8	Your hand will reach all your foes, your right hand, all who hate you.
Psalms	21	9	You will make them like a furnace of fire, when you appear, LORD . The LORD  will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire will devour them.
Psalms	21	10	You will sweep their offspring from the earth, their children from humanity.
Psalms	21	11	When they scheme against you and hatch evil plots – they will fail.
Psalms	21	12	For you aim your bow at their faces, make them turn in flight.
Psalms	21	13	Be exalted, LORD, in your strength, to your might we shall sing and make music.
Psalms	22	1	My God, my God, why have you left me, my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
Psalms	22	2	I cry in the day, you do not answer, I cry in the night but find no rest.
Psalms	22	3	You are the Holy One, throned on the praises of Israel.
Psalms	22	4	In you our ancestors trusted, they trusted and you delivered them.
Psalms	22	5	They cried to you, and found safety, in you did they trust and were not put to shame.
Psalms	22	6	But I am a worm, not a person; insulted by others, despised by the people.
Psalms	22	7	All who see me mock me, with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
Psalms	22	8	“He relies on the LORD ; let him save him. Let him rescue the one he holds dear!”
Psalms	22	9	But you drew me from the womb, laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
Psalms	22	10	On your care was I cast from my very birth, you are my God from my mother’s womb.
Psalms	22	11	Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh, and there is none to help.
Psalms	22	12	I am circled by many bulls, beset by the mighty of Bashan,
Psalms	22	13	who face me with gaping jaws, like ravening roaring lions.
Psalms	22	14	Poured out am I like water, and all my bones are loosened. My heart is become like wax, melted within me.
Psalms	22	15	My palate is dry as a sherd, my tongue sticks to my jaws; in the dust of death you lay me.

Psalms	26	12	My foot stands on even ground, in the choirs I will bless the LORD .
Psalms	27	1	The LORD  is my light and my savior; whom then should I fear? The LORD  protects my life; whom then should I dread?
Psalms	27	2	When the wicked drew near to assail me and eat up my flesh, it was those who distressed and opposed me who stumbled and fell.
Psalms	27	3	Though against me a host should encamp, yet my heart would be fearless: though battle should rise up against me, still would I be trustful.
Psalms	27	4	One thing have I asked of the LORD, and that do I long for – To live in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the grace of the LORD and inquire in his temple.

Psalms	30	6	When all went well, I imagined that never should I be shaken.
Psalms	30	7	For by your favor, O LORD, you had set me on mountains strong: but you hide your face, and I was confounded.
Psalms	30	8	Then to you, LORD, I cried, to the LORD  I begged for mercy,
Psalms	30	9	“What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Can you be praised by dust? Can it tell of your faithfulness?
Psalms	30	10	Hear, LORD, and show me your favor, LORD  be a helper to me.”
Psalms	30	11	You have turned my mourning to dancing; my sackcloth you have unloosed, and clothed me with joy:
Psalms	30	12	that unceasingly I should sing your praise, and give thanks to you, LORD  my God, forever.
Psalms	31	1	In you, O LORD, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame. Rescue me in your faithfulness;
Psalms	31	2	incline to me your ear. Deliver me speedily. Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me.

Psalms	31	7	I will rejoice and be glad in your love, because you have looked on my misery, and cared for me in my distress.
Psalms	31	8	You have not given me into the enemy’s hand, you have set my feet in a spacious place.
Psalms	31	9	Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed; my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
Psalms	31	10	For my life is consumed with grief, and my years with sighing. My strength is broken with misery, my bones waste away.
Psalms	31	11	The scorn of all my foes, the butt of my neighbors am I, a terror to my acquaintance. At the sight of me in the street people turn quickly away.
Psalms	31	12	I am clean forgotten like the dead, am become like a ruined vessel.
Psalms	31	13	I hear the whispers of many – terror on every side – scheming together against me, plotting to take my life.

Psalms	31	16	Make your face to shine on your servant, save me in your love.
Psalms	31	17	Put me not, O LORD, to shame, for I have called upon you. Let the wicked be put to shame silent in Sheol.

Psalms	31	19	How great is the goodness you have treasured for those who fear you, and wrought for those who take refuge in you, in plain sight of all!
Psalms	31	20	In your sheltering wings you hide them from plottings of people, you keep them safe in a bower from the chiding of tongues.
Psalms	31	21	Blest be the LORD for the wonderful love he has shown me in time of distress.
Psalms	31	22	For I had said in panic, “I am driven clean out of your sight.” But you heard my plea, when I cried to you for help.
Psalms	31	23	Love the LORD, all you faithful; the LORD  protects the loyal, but repays the haughty in full.
Psalms	31	24	Let your hearts be courageous and strong, all you who wait on the LORD .
Psalms	32	1	Happy those whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.
Psalms	32	2	Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit, to whom the LORD  reckons no debt of guilt.
Psalms	32	3	When I held my peace, my bones wore away with my endless groaning;
Psalms	32	4	for day and night did your hand lie heavy upon me. The sap of my life was dried up as with fierce summer-heat. *Selah*
Psalms	32	5	I began to acknowledge my sin, not concealing my guilt; and the moment I vowed to confess to the LORD  my transgression, then you yourself did pardon the guilt of my sin. *Selah*
Psalms	32	6	For this cause let all who are faithful pray to you in the time of distress; then, when the great waters rush, they will not reach to him.
Psalms	32	7	For you are my shelter, you protect me from trouble, and surround me with deliverance. *Selah*
Psalms	32	8	“With my eye steadfastly upon you, I will instruct and teach you The way you should go.
Psalms	32	9	Do not be like the horse or the mule, that have no understanding, but need bridle and halter to curb them, else they will not come near to you.”

Psalms	33	2	Give thanks to the LORD  on the lyre, play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
Psalms	33	3	Sing to him a new song, play skilfully and shout merrily.
Psalms	33	4	For the LORD  is straight in his promise; and all that he does is in faithfulness.
Psalms	33	5	Justice and right he loves; the earth is full of his kindness.
Psalms	33	6	By his word the heavens were made, all their host by the breath of his mouth.
Psalms	33	7	He gathers the sea in a bottle, the ocean he puts into store-houses.
Psalms	33	8	Let the whole world honor the LORD, let all who live on earth be in awe.
Psalms	33	9	For at his word it came into being, at his command it stood forth.
Psalms	33	10	The LORD  frustrates the designs of the nations, what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
Psalms	33	11	but the LORD ’s own design will stand forever, and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
Psalms	33	12	Happy the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for himself as his own.
Psalms	33	13	The LORD  looks down from heaven, he sees all of humanity;
Psalms	33	14	from where he rules he gazes on all who inhabit the earth.
Psalms	33	15	He fashions the hearts of them all, and gives heed to all that they do.
Psalms	33	16	It is not by great armies that kings are victorious, it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
Psalms	33	17	false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory, for all its great might it can provide no escape.
Psalms	33	18	See! The eye of the LORD  is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his kindness;
Psalms	33	19	to deliver their life from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Psalms	33	20	We wait for the LORD : he is our help and our shield.

Psalms	34	4	I sought the LORD, and, in answer, he saved me from all my terrors.
Psalms	34	5	Look to him and you will be radiant, with faces unashamed.
Psalms	34	6	Here is one who was crushed, but cried and was heard by the LORD, and brought safe out of every trouble.
Psalms	34	7	The LORD ’s angel encamps about those who fear him, and rescues them.
Psalms	34	8	O taste and see that the LORD  is good, happy those who take refuge in him.
Psalms	34	9	Fear the LORD, all his people, for they who fear him lack nothing.
Psalms	34	10	Even young lions may be poor and hungry, but those who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.
Psalms	34	11	Come, children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the LORD .
Psalms	34	12	Which of you is desirous of life, loves many and happy days?
Psalms	34	13	Then guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.
Psalms	34	14	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
Psalms	34	15	The eyes of the LORD  are towards the righteous, his ears are towards their cry for help.
Psalms	34	16	The LORD  sets his face against those who do evil, to root their memory out of the earth.
Psalms	34	17	When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD, and he saves them from all their distresses.
Psalms	34	18	The LORD  is near to the broken-hearted, he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
Psalms	34	19	Many misfortunes befall the righteous, but the LORD  delivers them out of them all.
Psalms	34	20	He guards all their bones, none are broken.
Psalms	34	21	Misfortune will slay the ungodly; those who hate the righteous are doomed.
Psalms	34	22	The LORD  ransoms the life of his servants, and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.
Psalms	35	1	Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me, do battle with those who do battle with me.
Psalms	35	2	Grasp shield and buckler, and rise up as my help.
Psalms	35	3	Draw spear and battle-axe, confront those who pursue me. Assure me that you will help me.
Psalms	35	4	Dishonor and shame be on those who are seeking my life! Defeat and confusion on those who are planning my hurt!
Psalms	35	5	As chaff before wind may they be, with the LORD ’s angel pursuing them.
Psalms	35	6	Slippery and dark be their way, with his angel thrusting them on.
Psalms	35	7	For they wantonly hid their net for me, and dug a pit to destroy me.
Psalms	35	8	Upon them may ruin come unawares; may the net which they hid catch themselves, and into the pit may they fall.
Psalms	35	9	Then I will exult in the LORD, and be joyful because of his help;
Psalms	35	10	and all my being will say, “Who, O LORD, is like you, who save the helpless from those too strong for them, the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?”
Psalms	35	11	Violent witnesses rise, and ask of me things that I know not.
Psalms	35	12	Evil for good they requite me, leaving me inwardly comfortless.
Psalms	35	13	But when *they* were sick, *I* put on sackcloth, and chastened myself with fasting. I prayed with head bowed low,
Psalms	35	14	as if for my friend or my brother. I went about bowed and in mourning, as one who laments his mother.
Psalms	35	15	When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered, strangers gathered around me, and tore at me without ceasing,
Psalms	35	16	impiously mocking and mocking, bearing their teeth at me.
Psalms	35	17	How long, LORD, will you look on? Rescue me from their roaring, my precious life from the lions.
Psalms	35	18	I will then give you thanks in the great congregation, and praise you before many people.
Psalms	35	19	Suffer not those to rejoice over me who are falsely my foes, suffer not those who without cause abhor me to wink with the eye.
Psalms	35	20	For it is not peace that they speak of those who are quiet in the land; but treacherous charges they plot.
Psalms	35	21	With wide open mouths they shout, “Hurrah! Hurrah! With our own eyes we saw it.”
Psalms	35	22	But you have seen, too, O LORD, keep not silence, O LORD, be not far from me.
Psalms	35	23	Bestir you, awake, for my right my God, my LORD, for my cause.
Psalms	35	24	You are just, LORD : win for me justice, let them not rejoice over me,
Psalms	35	25	inwardly saying, “Hurrah! The desire of our hearts at last! Now we have swallowed him up.”
Psalms	35	26	Shame and confusion together on those who rejoice at my hurt! Clothed with shame and dishonor be those who are haughty to me!
Psalms	35	27	Let such as delight in my cause ring out their gladness, and say evermore, “Great is the LORD  whose delight is the well-being of his servant.”
Psalms	35	28	Then my tongue will tell of your justice, and all the day long of your praise.
Psalms	36	1	Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked, who have no dread of God before their eyes.
Psalms	36	2	It flatters them in their eyes that their sin will not be found out.
Psalms	36	3	First, their speech becomes wicked and false, they give up acting wisely and well.
Psalms	36	4	Then they plot deliberate wrong, take their stand on the wicked way, without the least shrinking from evil.
Psalms	36	5	Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens, your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
Psalms	36	6	Your justice is like the great mountains, your judgments are like the broad sea. LORD, you save people and animals.
Psalms	36	7	How precious your love, O God! All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
Psalms	36	8	They feast on the fat of your house, they drink of your brook of delights.
Psalms	36	9	For with you is the fountain of life, in the light that is yours we see light.
Psalms	36	10	O continue your grace to the faithful, your love to the upright in heart.
Psalms	36	11	Let no arrogant foot tread upon me, no wicked hand drive me to exile.
Psalms	36	12	There the workers of wrong lie prostrate, thrust down to rise up no more.
Psalms	37	1	Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked, nor envious of those who work wrong;
Psalms	37	2	for, like grass, they will speedily wither, and fade like the green of young grass.
Psalms	37	3	Trust in the LORD, and do good; remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
Psalms	37	4	then the LORD  will be your delight, he will grant you your heart’s petitions.
Psalms	37	5	Commit your way to the LORD ; trust in him, and he will act,
Psalms	37	6	making clear as the light your right, and your just cause clear as the noon-day.
Psalms	37	7	In silence and patience wait on the LORD . Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper. At those who execute evil devices.
Psalms	37	8	Desist from anger, abandon wrath: be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
Psalms	37	9	for evildoers will be cut off, but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD .
Psalms	37	10	Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish: look at their place: they are there no more.
Psalms	37	11	But the humble will have the land, and the rapture of peace in abundance.
Psalms	37	12	The wicked plots against the righteous, snarls like a wild animal;
Psalms	37	13	the LORD  laughs, for he sees that his day is coming.
Psalms	37	14	The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow, to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
Psalms	37	15	but their sword will pierce their own heart, and their bows will be broken in pieces.
Psalms	37	16	Better is the righteous person’s little than the wealth of many wicked.
Psalms	37	17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD  upholds the righteous.
Psalms	37	18	The LORD  watches over the days of the blameless, their heritage will continue forever.
Psalms	37	19	They will not be shamed in the evil time, in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
Psalms	37	20	Because the wicked will perish: but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven, will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.
Psalms	37	21	The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back, but the righteous is lavish and gives.
Psalms	37	22	For those blest by the LORD  inherit the land, while those whom he curses will be cut off.
Psalms	37	23	The LORD  supports the steps of those with whom he is pleased.
Psalms	37	24	Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong, for the LORD  holds their hands.
Psalms	37	25	Never, from youth to age, have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.
Psalms	37	26	They are ever lavishly lending, and their children are fountains of blessing.
Psalms	37	27	Turn away from evil and do good and you will live in the land forever.
Psalms	37	28	For the LORD  loves justice, he does not forsake his friends.  The unrighteous will be destroyed forever, and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
Psalms	37	29	But the land will belong to the righteous, they will live upon it forever,
Psalms	37	30	The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom, and words of justice are on their tongues.
Psalms	37	31	The law of their God is in their heart, their steps are never unsteady.
Psalms	37	32	The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to put them to death.
Psalms	37	33	But the LORD  leaves them not in their hand: at their trial they will not be held guilty.
Psalms	37	34	Wait on the LORD, and observe his way: he will lift you to honor the land will be yours, you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.
Psalms	37	35	I have seen the wicked exultant, lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
Psalms	37	36	But the moment I passed, they vanished! I sought for them, but they could not be found.
Psalms	37	37	Preserve your honor and practise uprightness, for such a person fares well in the end.
Psalms	37	38	But transgressors will perish together. Cut off are the wicked forever.
Psalms	37	39	The righteous are saved by the LORD, who in time of distress is their refuge:
Psalms	37	40	the LORD  helps and rescue them, from the wicked he rescues and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
Psalms	38	1	Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath;
Psalms	38	2	for your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand lies heavy upon me.
Psalms	38	3	In my flesh is no soundness because of your anger, no health in my bones, because of my sin.
Psalms	38	4	For that my guilt is gone over my head: it weighs like a burden too heavy for me.
Psalms	38	5	My wounds stink and fester, for my foolishness I am tormented.
Psalms	38	6	Bent and bowed am I utterly, all the day going in mourning.
Psalms	38	7	My loins are filled with burning, and in my flesh is no soundness.
Psalms	38	8	I am utterly crushed and numb; I cry louder than lion roars.
Psalms	38	9	LORD, you know all that I long for, my groans are not hidden from you.
Psalms	38	10	My heart is throbbing, my strength has failed me. The light of my eyes – even it is gone from me.
Psalms	38	11	My dear ones and friends keep aloof, and my neighbors stand afar off.
Psalms	38	12	They who aim at my life lay their snares, they who seek my hurt speak of ruin, nursing treachery all the day long.
Psalms	38	13	But I turn a deaf ear and hear not; like the dumb I open not my mouth.
Psalms	38	14	I am like one without hearing, with no arguments in my mouth.
Psalms	38	15	For my hope, O LORD, is in you. You will answer, O LORD  my God,
Psalms	38	16	when I utter the hope that those who made scorn of my tottering feet may not rejoice over me.
Psalms	38	17	For I am ready to fall, my pain forsakes me never.
Psalms	38	18	I acknowledge my guilt, I am anxious because of my sin:
Psalms	38	19	My wanton assailants are strong, those who wrongfully hate me are many,
Psalms	38	20	who render me evil for good, and oppose me, because I make good my goal.
Psalms	38	21	Do not forsake me, O LORD ; my God, be not far from me.
Psalms	38	22	Hasten to help me, O LORD  my savior.
Psalms	39	1	I vowed to watch my words, and sin not with my tongue, but to put on my mouth a muzzle, while the wicked were in my presence.
Psalms	39	2	I was silent and dumb, speechless: but my pain was stirred up.
Psalms	39	3	My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire was kindled, till at last the words came to my tongue.
Psalms	39	4	“Teach me, O LORD, my end, and the sum of my days what it is. Let me know how transient I am.
Psalms	39	5	See! My days you have made but a span, and my life is as nothing before you. It is but as a breath that everyone stands: *Selah*
Psalms	39	6	it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro, and all our noise is for nothing. We heap up, and know not who will gather.”
Psalms	39	7	And now, what wait I for, LORD ? My hope is in you.
Psalms	39	8	From all my transgressions deliver me; make me not the scorn of the fool.
Psalms	39	9	I am dumb, never opening my mouth, for this is your own doing.
Psalms	39	10	Remove your stroke from off me: by the might of your hand I am spent.
Psalms	39	11	When you rebuke someone to punish their sins, you consume, like a moth, what they treasures. Everyone is only a breath. *Selah*
Psalms	39	12	Hear my prayer, O LORD ; attend to my cry for help. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am but a guest of yours, a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
Psalms	39	13	Look away from me, let me smile again, before I die and am gone.
Psalms	40	1	For the LORD  I waited and waited, till, inclining to me, he heard my cry.
Psalms	40	2	From the horrible pit he drew me, up out of the miry clay; he set my feet on a rock, and my steps he made firm.
Psalms	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth, of praise to our God. Many see it, and, filled with awe, put their trust in the LORD .
Psalms	40	4	Happy the person who has put in the LORD  their trust, not looking to false gods or turning to idols.
Psalms	40	5	With us you have wrought in rich measure, O LORD  our God, your marvels and purposes for us – none may compare with you – were I to declare or to tell them, past counting are they.
Psalms	40	6	In offerings bloody or bloodless you have no delight, but with open ears you have made me. Burnt-offering and offering for sin are not what you ask.
Psalms	40	7	Then said I, “Here I am, as the roll of the book has enjoined.
Psalms	40	8	My delight, O God, is to do your will, and your law is within my heart.”
Psalms	40	9	Well, O LORD, you know that, with lips unrestrained, your righteousness I told in the great congregation,
Psalms	40	10	not hiding it in my heart. I have told of your steadfast help, from the great congregation I hid not your love and your faithfulness.
Psalms	40	11	So do not restrain, LORD, your pity from us. Your love and your faithfulness – ever may they be our shield.
Psalms	40	12	For evils that cannot be numbered have compassed me round. My transgressions have followed me up – I can bear it no more. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has forsaken me.
Psalms	40	13	O LORD, be pleased to deliver me, haste to my help, O LORD .
Psalms	40	14	May those who are seeking my life be ashamed and confounded together; may those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonor.
Psalms	40	15	May those who hurrah over me be dumbfounded because of their shame.
Psalms	40	16	But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all those eager for your aid, say, “Great is the LORD ” evermore.
Psalms	40	17	I am weak and needy, yet the LORD  cares for me. You are my help and deliverer; don’t delay, my God.
Psalms	41	1	Happy are those who consider the weak; in the day of misfortune the LORD  will deliver them.
Psalms	41	2	He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land, and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
Psalms	41	3	The LORD  will sustain them on bed of languishing; tending their sickness, as long as they lie.
Psalms	41	4	For this cause I say, “LORD, show me your favor; heal me, because I have sinned against you.”
Psalms	41	5	My enemies speak of me nothing but evil, “When will he die, and his name pass away?”
Psalms	41	6	When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; and when they go out, they give it speech.
Psalms	41	7	In secret they whisper together against me, all those who hate me plot evil against me.
Psalms	41	8	“Some fatal disease has fastened upon him; and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.”
Psalms	41	9	My most trusted friend, on whom I relied, who ate of my bread, has turned against me.
Psalms	41	10	But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up, that I may pay them their due reward.
Psalms	41	11	By this will I know you delight in me: if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
Psalms	41	12	For my innocence you uphold me, and set me forever before your face.
Psalms	41	13	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,* *from everlasting to everlasting,* *Amen and Amen.*
Psalms	42	1	Like the hart which longs for brooks of water, I long for you, God.
Psalms	42	2	I thirst for God, for my living God. When shall I enter in, and see the face of God?
Psalms	42	3	My tears have been my food by day and by night; for they say to me all the day long, “Where is your God?”
Psalms	42	4	My heart floods with sorrow, as I call to mind: how I used to pass on with the throng, at their head, to the house of God, with glad shouts and giving of thanks, in the throng who kept festival.
Psalms	42	5	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
Psalms	42	6	I am sunk in my misery; I will therefore call you to mind from the land of Jordan and Hermon, the mountain Mizar.
Psalms	42	7	Flood is calling to flood at the noise of your cataracts; all your waves and your breakers have passed over me.
Psalms	42	8	In the day I cry to the LORD to summon his kindness; and the song that I sing in the night is a prayer to the living God.
Psalms	42	9	I say to God my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?”
Psalms	42	10	It pierces me to the heart to hear the enemy’s taunts, as all the day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
Psalms	42	11	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
Psalms	43	1	Right me, defend my cause against a pitiless people. From the crafty and crooked, O God, deliver me.
Psalms	43	2	For you are God my protector: why have you cast me off? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?
Psalms	43	3	Send forth your light and your truth, let them be my guides: to your holy hill let them bring me, to the place where you live.
Psalms	43	4	Then will I go to God’s altar, to God my rejoicing; and with joy on the lyre I will praise you, O God, my God.
Psalms	43	5	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.
Psalms	44	1	O God, we have heard with our ears, all our ancestors have told us of the work that you wrought in their day, your wonders in days of old,
Psalms	44	2	uprooting and crushing the nations, then planting and settling them. For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
Psalms	44	3	it was not their own arm that brought them the victory. Yours was the hand and the arm, yours was the face that shone on them with favor.
Psalms	44	4	It was you, my king and my God, that ordained the victories of Jacob.
Psalms	44	5	Through you we can thrust back our foes, and by your name tread down our assailants:
Psalms	44	6	for not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword win me the victory.
Psalms	44	7	Our victory comes from you, and confusion to those who hate us.
Psalms	44	8	In God we boast all the day long, and your name will we praise forever. *Selah*
Psalms	44	9	Yet you have spurned and disgraced us, in not going forth with our armies,
Psalms	44	10	and in making us flee from the foe, so that those who hated us plundered us.
Psalms	44	11	You have let us be eaten like sheep, you have scattered us over the world,
Psalms	44	12	sold your people for a pittance, and getting no gain from their price.
Psalms	44	13	You have made us the butt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of all round us.
Psalms	44	14	O’er the world you have made us a byword, the nations at us shake their heads.
Psalms	44	15	My disgrace is forever before me, my face is covered with shame,
Psalms	44	16	at the words of blasphemer and scoffer, at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.
Psalms	44	17	All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
Psalms	44	18	Our heart has not turned back, nor our steps declined from your way,
Psalms	44	19	that you thus should have crushed us down, and covered us over with gloom, in the place where the jackals roam.
Psalms	44	20	Had we forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
Psalms	44	21	would God not have searched this out? For he knows the heart and its secrets.
Psalms	44	22	But in your cause it is we are killed all the day, and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psalms	44	23	Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord? Awake, cast us not off forever.
Psalms	44	24	Why do you hide your face, forgetting our stress and our misery?
Psalms	44	25	For we have sunk down to the dust, our bodies cling to the ground.
Psalms	44	26	Arise, come to our help: for your love’s sake, ransom us.
Psalms	45	1	My heart is astir with beautiful words: I will sing a song, concerning the king, with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.
Psalms	45	2	Your beauty is more than mortal, grace is shed over your lips: therefore God has blessed you forever.
Psalms	45	3	Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh. What glory and splendor!
Psalms	45	4	Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice. May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
Psalms	45	5	Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you: pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.
Psalms	45	6	Your throne shall endure for ever and ever your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
Psalms	45	7	Right you love and wrong you hate: therefore the LORD  your God anoints you With oil of gladness above your fellows.
Psalms	45	8	With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant, you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
Psalms	45	9	King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you, at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Psalms	45	10	Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear: forget your folk and your father’s house.
Psalms	45	11	And when the king desires your beauty, bow to him, for he is your lord.
Psalms	45	12	So shall the Tyrians come with gifts, and the richest of people will do you homage.
Psalms	45	13	The king’s daughter is glorious altogether, with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
Psalms	45	14	In many-coloured robes she is led to the king, with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
Psalms	45	15	The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.
Psalms	45	16	May sons of yours take the place of your fathers, whom you will make princes in all the land.
Psalms	45	17	Your name will I celebrate world without end, so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.
Psalms	46	1	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Psalms	46	2	So we have no fear, though earth should change, and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
Psalms	46	3	Let its waters roar and foam, let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. On our side is the LORD  of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. *Selah*
Psalms	46	4	A river there is, whose streams make glad God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
Psalms	46	5	God is within her: she cannot be shaken. God helps her at the turn of the morning.
Psalms	46	6	Nations roared, kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
Psalms	46	7	On our side is the LORD  of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob.
Psalms	46	8	Come and see what the LORD  has done, working appallingly in the earth.
Psalms	46	9	He stills wars to the ends of the earth – breaking the bow, snapping the spear, burning the chariots in the fire.
Psalms	46	10	“Refrain; and know surely that I am God, high over the nations, high over the world.”
Psalms	46	11	On our side is the LORD  of Hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. *Selah*
Psalms	47	1	Clap your hands, all you peoples: shout to God in ringing cries.
Psalms	47	2	For the LORD  is most high and dread, a great king over all the earth.
Psalms	47	3	He subdues the peoples under us, the nations under our feet;
Psalms	47	4	he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. *Selah*
Psalms	47	5	God is gone up with a shout, the LORD  with the sound of a trumpet.
Psalms	47	6	Sing praise to our God, sing praises: sing praise to our king, sing praises.
Psalms	47	7	For king of all earth is he: praise God in a skilful song.
Psalms	47	8	God is king over all the nations, God sits on his holy throne.
Psalms	47	9	Princes of nations gather with the people of Abraham’s God: for the shields of the earth are God’s; greatly exalted is he.
Psalms	48	1	Great is the LORD  and worthy all praise in the city of our God. His holy mountain,[48:2] that rises so fair, is the joy of all the world. Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion, the city of the great king.
Psalms	48	3	Once God made himself known as the defence of her palaces.
Psalms	48	4	For see! A concert of kings passed over the frontier together.
Psalms	48	5	But one glance, and they were astounded; they hastened away in dismay.
Psalms	48	6	Trembling took hold of them there, like the pains of a woman in labor.
Psalms	48	7	They were shattered, as east wind shatters the giant ships in pieces.
Psalms	48	8	What we heard, we now have seen in the city of the LORD  of hosts, the city of our God. God will uphold her forever. *Selah*
Psalms	48	9	We think, O God, of your love, in the midst of your temple.
Psalms	48	10	Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend to the ends of the earth. Victory fills your hand.
Psalms	48	11	Let mount Zion be glad; let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
Psalms	48	12	Walk about Zion, go round her; count her towers.
Psalms	48	13	Set your mind on her ramparts, consider her palaces; that you tell to the next generation
Psalms	48	14	That such is God, our God he it is who shall guide us for ever and ever.
Psalms	49	1	Hear this, you peoples all; attend, all you who live in the world
Psalms	49	2	people of low degree and high, the rich and the poor together.
Psalms	49	3	My mouth shall utter wisdom, the thoughts of a seeing heart.
Psalms	49	4	I incline my ear to a proverb, on the lyre I will open my riddle.
Psalms	49	5	Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune, when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
Psalms	49	6	who put their trust in their wealth, and boast of their boundless riches?
Psalms	49	7	For assuredly no one can ransom themselves, or give to God the price of their life,
Psalms	49	8	for the ransom of a life is costly, no payment is ever enough,
Psalms	49	9	to keep them alive for ever and ever, so as never to see the pit at all.
Psalms	49	10	But see it they will. Even wise people die, the fool and the brutish perish alike, and abandon their wealth to others.
Psalms	49	11	The grave is their everlasting home, the place they shall live in for ever and ever, though after their own names they called whole lands.
Psalms	49	12	Despite their wealth, they perish like dumb animals.
Psalms	49	13	This is the fate of the confident fool, and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. *Selah*
Psalms	49	14	Like sheep they descend to Sheol with Death for their shepherd; down they go straight to the grave, and their form wastes away in their home below.
Psalms	49	15	But God will assuredly ransom my life from the hand of Sheol; for he will receive me. *Selah*
Psalms	49	16	So be not afraid when someone grows rich, when the wealth of their house increases.
Psalms	49	17	Not a shred of it all can they take when they die, wealth cannot follow them down.
Psalms	49	18	Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive, and win praise from many for faring so well,
Psalms	49	19	they must join their ancestors, who see the light nevermore.
Psalms	49	20	The wealthy are without understanding, they perish like dumb animals.
Psalms	50	1	The LORD  God has spoken: He summons the earth from sunrise to sunset.
Psalms	50	2	From Zion, perfection of beauty, God’s glory shines forth.
Psalms	50	3	Our God comes, he cannot keep silence, devouring fire is before him, and furious tempest around him.
Psalms	50	4	He summons the heavens above and the earth to judge his people.
Psalms	50	5	Gather to him his saints by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
Psalms	50	6	that the heavens may declare his justice, for a God of justice is he. *Selah*
Psalms	50	7	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak, and protest to you, O Israel: I am the LORD, your God.
Psalms	50	8	Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you your burnt-offerings are ever before me
Psalms	50	9	Not a bullock will I take from your house, nor male goats out of your folds;
Psalms	50	10	for all beasts of the forest are mine, and the kine on a thousand hills.
Psalms	50	11	I know all the birds of the air, all that moves on the fields is mine.
Psalms	50	12	Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fulness are mine.
Psalms	50	13	Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh, or drink the blood of goats?
Psalms	50	14	Offer to God a thank-offering, pay the Most High your vows.
Psalms	50	15	Summon me in the day of distress, I will rescue you, so will you honor me.”
Psalms	50	16	But to the wicked God says: “What right have you to talk of my statutes, or take my covenant into your mouth
Psalms	50	17	while you yourself hate correction, and cast my words behind you?
Psalms	50	18	When you see a thief, you run with them; with adulterers you keep company.
Psalms	50	19	You let your mouth loose for evil, your tongue contrives deceit.
Psalms	50	20	You shamefully speak of your kin, and slander your own mother’s son.
Psalms	50	21	And because I kept silence at this, you did take me for one like yourself. But I will convict you and show you plainly.
Psalms	50	22	“Now you who forget God, mark this, lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
Psalms	50	23	Those who bring a thank-offering honor me; but to those: who follows my way, I will show the salvation of God.”
Psalms	51	1	In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me, in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
Psalms	51	2	Wash me clean of my guilt, make me pure of my sin.
Psalms	51	3	For well I know my transgressions, my sin is ever before me.
Psalms	51	4	Against you, only you, have I sinned, and done that which is wrong in your sight: you therefore are just when you speak, and clear when you utter judgment.
Psalms	51	5	See! In guilt was I brought to the birth, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Psalms	51	6	It’s the innermost truth you desire, give me therefore true wisdom of heart.
Psalms	51	7	Purge me clean with hyssop, wash me whiter than snow.
Psalms	51	8	Fill me with joy and gladness, let the bones you have broken rejoice.
Psalms	51	9	Hide your face from my sins, and blot out my guilt altogether.
Psalms	51	10	Create me a clean heart, O God, put a new steadfast spirit within me.
Psalms	51	11	Cast me not forth from your presence, withdraw not your holy spirit.
Psalms	51	12	Give me back the joy of your help, with a willing spirit sustain me.
Psalms	51	13	I will teach your ways to transgressors, and sinners shall turn to you.
Psalms	51	14	Save me from blood, O God, and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
Psalms	51	15	Open my lips, O LORD, and my mouth shall declare your praise.
Psalms	51	16	For in sacrifice you have no pleasure, in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
Psalms	51	17	The sacrifice pleasing to God is a spirit that is broken; a heart that is crushed, O God, you will not despise.
Psalms	51	18	Do good in your pleasure to Zion, build the walls of Jerusalem.
Psalms	51	19	Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice, then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.
Psalms	52	1	Why glory in mischief, you hero? God’s kindness is all the day.
Psalms	52	2	Engulfing ruin you plot, your tongue like a razor sharpened, you practiser of deceit.
Psalms	52	3	Evil, not good, you love, and falsehood, not words of truth. *Selah*
Psalms	52	4	But you love all words that devour, and a tongue that is given to deceit.
Psalms	52	5	But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever, grasp you and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. *Selah*
Psalms	52	6	Smitten with awe at the sight, the righteous shall laugh at you.
Psalms	52	7	“Look” (they will say) “at the hero who did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealth and in the strength of his riches.”
Psalms	52	8	But I am like a fresh olive-tree in the house of God. I trust in the kindness of God for ever and evermore.
Psalms	52	9	I will render you thanks for ever for what you have done. I will tell how good you are in the presence of those who love you.
Psalms	53	1	Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.
Psalms	53	2	From heaven God looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.
Psalms	53	3	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.
Psalms	53	4	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD .
Psalms	53	5	Sore afraid will they be, where no fear was; when God scatters the bones of the godless people. They will be put to shame, when God rejects them.
Psalms	53	6	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When God brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
Psalms	54	1	Save me, O God, by your name, by your power secure for me justice.
Psalms	54	2	Listen, O God, to my prayer, attend to the words of my mouth.
Psalms	54	3	For proud men have risen against me, and terrible men seek my life, men who do not set God before them. *Selah*
Psalms	54	4	But see! God is my helper, the LORD  is sustaining my life.
Psalms	54	5	Let their evil fall back on my foes: cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD .
Psalms	54	6	Then will I bring you glad sacrifice, praising your gracious name;
Psalms	54	7	for from all distress you have saved me, and feasted my eyes on my foes.
Psalms	55	1	Listen, God, to my prayer. Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
Psalms	55	2	Hear me, and answer; for bitter is my lament.
Psalms	55	3	I am wild with the noise of the foe, with the clamor of the ungodly; for they hurl disaster upon me, and attack me with fury.
Psalms	55	4	My heart shudders within me, terrors of deaths press on me,
Psalms	55	5	fear and trembling attack me, and horror wraps me round.
Psalms	55	6	O for the wings of a dove: I would fly away and rest.
Psalms	55	7	I would wander far away, find refuge in the wilderness. *Selah*
Psalms	55	8	I would find myself a shelter from raging wind and tempest.
Psalms	55	9	Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans; for I see violence and strife in the city.
Psalms	55	10	By day and by night they make their rounds on the city walls, while within is crime and trouble,
Psalms	55	11	within is ruin. Her market-place is never free of deceit and tyranny.  ##### The Treacherous Friend #####
Psalms	55	12	The taunts were not those of a foe that I could have borne; the disdain was not that of an enemy I could have shunned them:
Psalms	55	13	but it was you, my equal, my dear and familiar friend.
Psalms	55	14	We used to be so close, together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.
Psalms	55	15	May death suddenly take them, may they go down to Sheol alive, for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.
Psalms	55	16	But I will call on God, the LORD  will save me.
Psalms	55	17	Evening and morning and noon I lament and moan. He will hear my voice;
Psalms	55	18	though I am attacked by many he will rescue me, unharmed from the war.
Psalms	55	19	God, who sits on his ancient throne will hear and will humble them, for they never change, they never fear God. *Selah*
Psalms	55	20	My friend turned against me, betrayed his word.
Psalms	55	21	His mouth was smoother than butter, but war filled his heart. His words were softer than oil, but sharper than swords.
Psalms	55	22	Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never let the righteous be shaken.
Psalms	55	23	But you, God, will hurl them down to the deepest pit. Bloody and treacherous people will not live out half their days; but I will trust you.
Psalms	56	1	O God, be gracious to me, for people trample upon me, all the day righting and pressing me.
Psalms	56	2	All the day enemies trample me; many there be who contend with me bitterly.
Psalms	56	3	In the day of my terror I trust in you.
Psalms	56	4	In God I maintain my cause, in God I fearlessly trust. What can flesh do to me?
Psalms	56	5	They torture me all the day, they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
Psalms	56	6	banded together in secret, watching my every step, as those who hope for my death.
Psalms	56	7	Pay them out for their sin, O God, hurl down the strong in your anger.
Psalms	56	8	You yourself count my wanderings. Put in your bottle my tears are they not in your book?
Psalms	56	9	Then shall my foes be turned back in the day that I call. Of this I am sure, because God is for me.
Psalms	56	10	In God I maintain my cause, in the LORD  I maintain my cause.
Psalms	56	11	In God I fearlessly trust, what can people do to me?
Psalms	56	12	Your vows are upon me, O God, I will render thank-offerings to you;
Psalms	56	13	because you have saved me from death, my feet from stumbling, to the end that I walk before God in the light of the living.
Psalms	57	1	Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me, for in you I take shelter. In your sheltering wings I take refuge, till ruin be over past.
Psalms	57	2	I cry to the Most High God, to the God who accomplishes for me.
Psalms	57	3	He will send me his succour from heaven, he will thrust away those who would trample me. *Selah*
Psalms	57	4	In the midst of lions I lie, who devour human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
Psalms	57	5	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
Psalms	57	6	They set a net for my feet, but in it was their own foot caught. Before me they dug a pit, but they fell into it themselves. *Selah*
Psalms	57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music;
Psalms	57	8	awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.
Psalms	57	9	I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD, and make music among the nations to you;
Psalms	57	10	for great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
Psalms	57	11	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.
Psalms	58	1	Do you speak what is right, you gods? With equity judge you your people?
Psalms	58	2	In the land you practise iniquity – all of you; violence do you dispense with your hands.
Psalms	58	3	The wicked go astray from the womb liars take the wrong path from their birth.
Psalms	58	4	Venom have they like the venom of snakes, they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
Psalms	58	5	and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer, or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.
Psalms	58	6	O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth, tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD .
Psalms	58	7	May they melt away like running water! Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
Psalms	58	8	Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path, like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
Psalms	58	9	Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots, he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
Psalms	58	10	The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous; their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
Psalms	58	11	People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded: yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”
Psalms	59	1	Save me, O God, from my enemies; secure me from my assailants.
Psalms	59	2	Save me from those who do wrong, save me from the bloodthirsty.
Psalms	59	3	For see! They lay ambush for me, strong men are banded against me not for sin or transgression of mine, for no guilt of mine, O LORD,
Psalms	59	4	they run and make ready. Awake! Come forth to meet me, and see!
Psalms	59	5	You, O LORD  of hosts, God of Israel, awake! And punish the proud, every one; spare none of the traitors vile. *Selah*
Psalms	59	6	At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
Psalms	59	7	Look at their venomous mouths, tongues like swords, they think no one hears them.
Psalms	59	8	But you, LORD, laugh at them, you mock all the insolent.
Psalms	59	9	My strength, I will sing to you, for God is my sure retreat.
Psalms	59	10	My God with his love will meet me, and feast my eyes on my foes.
Psalms	59	11	Slay them not, lest my people forget, let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
Psalms	59	12	In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD ; and may they be trapped in their pride, for the curses and lies that they utter.
Psalms	59	13	In your wrath make a clean end of them, that people, to the ends of the earth, may know that God rules in Jacob. *Selah*
Psalms	59	14	At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.
Psalms	59	15	They roam about for a feast, and snarl, if they get not their fill.
Psalms	59	16	But I will sing of your might; I will ring out your love in the morning. For to me you have been a sure refuge, a retreat in the day of my trouble.
Psalms	59	17	My strength, I will sing praise to you, for God is my sure retreat, my faithful God.
Psalms	60	1	O God, you have spurned and broken us, routing us in your wrath – restore us!
Psalms	60	2	You have shaken the land and cleft it; heal its tottering breaches.
Psalms	60	3	You have made your people drink hardship, and given us wine of reeling.
Psalms	60	4	You have given those who fear you a banner, a rallying-place from the bow, *Selah*
Psalms	60	5	for the rescue of your beloved. Save by your right hand and answer us.
Psalms	60	6	God did solemnly swear: “As victor will I divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Psalms	60	7	Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, Ephraim is the defence of my head, Judah my sceptre of rule,
Psalms	60	8	Moab the pot that I wash in, Edom – I cast my shoe over it, I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
Psalms	60	9	O to be brought to the fortified city! O to be led into Edom!
Psalms	60	10	Have you not spurned us, O God? You do not march forth with our armies.
Psalms	60	11	Grant us help from the foe, for human help is worthless.
Psalms	60	12	With God we shall yet do bravely: he himself will tread down our foes.
Psalms	61	1	Hear my cry, O God, be attentive to my prayer.
Psalms	61	2	From the ends of the earth I call unto you, when my heart is faint: lead me to the rock that is high above me.
Psalms	61	3	For you are a refuge to me, a strong tower in face of the foe.
Psalms	61	4	O to be guest in your tent forever, hiding beneath your sheltering wings! *Selah*
Psalms	61	5	For you, O God, do hear my vows, and grant the desires of those who fear you.
Psalms	61	6	Add many days to the life of the king; may his years endure throughout all generations.
Psalms	61	7	In the presence of God be he throned forever; may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
Psalms	61	8	And I will sing praise to your name forever, paying my vows day after day.
Psalms	62	1	I wait alone in silence for God; From him comes my help.
Psalms	62	2	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
Psalms	62	3	How long will you, all of you, batter a man, as one might a leaning wall?
Psalms	62	4	From his height they are planning to topple him. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth, but inwardly they curse. *Selah*
Psalms	62	5	I wait alone in silence for God; for from him comes my hope.
Psalms	62	6	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely.
Psalms	62	7	On God rests my honor and safety, in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
Psalms	62	8	Trust in him, all you people assembled, pour out your heart in his presence; God is a refuge for us. *Selah*
Psalms	62	9	The lowly are nought but a breath, the lofty are but an illusion: in the balances up they go, they are lighter than breath altogether.
Psalms	62	10	Trust not in gain of extortion, set no vain hopes in robbery. As for wealth, if it bears fruit, set not your heart upon it.
Psalms	62	11	One thing God has uttered, two things there are which I heard that power belongs to God,
Psalms	62	12	and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness; for you requite each person according to what they have done.
Psalms	63	1	O God, my God, you, you do I seek: my heart thirsts for you, my body faints for you in a parched and waterless land.
Psalms	63	2	As I in the temple have seen you, beholding your power and your glory,
Psalms	63	3	for better than life is your kindness: my lips shall utter your praise.
Psalms	63	4	So, while I live, I will bless you, and lift up my hands in your name.
Psalms	63	5	As with marrow and fat am I feasted; with joyful lips I will praise you.
Psalms	63	6	I call you to mind on my bed, and muse on you in the night watches;
Psalms	63	7	for you have been my help, I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
Psalms	63	8	I cling close after you, your right hand holds me up.
Psalms	63	9	But those who seek after my life shall go down to the depths of the earth,
Psalms	63	10	given o’er to the power of the sword, or as prey for jackals to devour.
Psalms	63	11	But the king shall rejoice in God: all who own his allegiance will glory. For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.
Psalms	64	1	Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament: guard my life from the dread of the foe.
Psalms	64	2	Hide me from villains who secretly plot, from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
Psalms	64	3	who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, and aimed bitter words like arrows,
Psalms	64	4	which from ambush they launch at the blameless, shooting swiftly and unafraid.
Psalms	64	5	They strengthen their wicked purpose, they tell of the snares they have hidden, they say to themselves, “Who can see?”
Psalms	64	6	They think out their crimes full cunningly hidden deep in their crafty hearts.
Psalms	64	7	But God with his arrow will shoot them, swiftly shall they be smitten.
Psalms	64	8	For their tongue he will bring them to ruin, all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.
Psalms	64	9	Then every person, touched to awe, as they ponder what God has wrought, will tell the tale of his deeds.
Psalms	64	10	In the LORD  shall the righteous rejoice, in him shall they take refuge; and all the true-hearted shall glory.
Psalms	65	1	It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion, and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
Psalms	65	2	O you who hear prayer, unto you shall all flesh come.
Psalms	65	3	Our sins are too mighty for us, our transgressions you only can cover them.
Psalms	65	4	Happy the person who you choose to live beside you in your courts. O may we be filled with the joys of your house, of your holy temple.
Psalms	65	5	In dread deeds you loyally answer us, O God of our salvation, whom all ends of the earth put their trust in, and islands far away.
Psalms	65	6	By your strength you establish the hills, you are armed with might;
Psalms	65	7	you still the roaring of seas, and the turmoil of nations,
Psalms	65	8	so that those who live at earth’s bounds are awed at your signs: the lands of the sunrise and sunset you make to ring with joy.
Psalms	65	9	You visit and water the earth; you greatly enrich her with the river of God, which is full of water. You prepare the corn thereof,
Psalms	65	10	watering her furrows, settling her ridges; you make her soft with showers, and bless what grows thereon.
Psalms	65	11	You crown the year with your goodness, your chariot tracks drip with fatness.
Psalms	65	12	The desert pastures are lush, the hills greened with joy.
Psalms	65	13	The meadows are clothed with flocks, the valleys are covered with corn; they shout to each other and sing.
Psalms	66	1	Shout to God, all the earth,
Psalms	66	2	sing praise to his glorious name, sing his glorious praise.
Psalms	66	3	Say to God, “How dread are your works, so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
Psalms	66	4	All the earth does homage to you, singing praises to you, singing praise to your name.” *Selah*
Psalms	66	5	Come and see what God has done, awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
Psalms	66	6	He turns the sea into dry land, and people cross the river on foot. Let us therefore rejoice in him,
Psalms	66	7	the mighty Ruler eternal, whose eyes keep watch on the nations, that no rebel lift up his head. *Selah*
Psalms	66	8	O bless our God, you peoples; sound aloud his praise,
Psalms	66	9	who keeps us in life, and keeps our feet from slipping.
Psalms	66	10	For you, God, have tested us, have tried us, as silver is tried.
Psalms	66	11	You did bring us into prison, and put chains upon us,
Psalms	66	12	you did let people ride over our head. We went through fire and through water, but you led us out to a spacious place.
Psalms	66	13	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings, I will pay to you my vows,
Psalms	66	14	which my open lips have uttered, arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
Psalms	66	15	I will offer you offerings of fatlings, with the odour of burning rams, I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. *Selah*
Psalms	66	16	Come and hear my story all who fear God – of what he has done for me.
Psalms	66	17	For my mouth had no sooner invoked him than his praise was under my tongue.
Psalms	66	18	Had I cherished sin in my heart, the LORD  would never have listened.
Psalms	66	19	But assuredly God has listened, and attended to my loud prayer.
Psalms	66	20	Blessed be God, who turned not aside my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.
Psalms	67	1	Bless us, O God, with your favor, let the light of your face fall upon us; *Selah*
Psalms	67	2	that the world may know your way, and all nations your power to save.
Psalms	67	3	Let the peoples praise you, O God; let the peoples all of them praise you.
Psalms	67	4	Let the nations ring out their joy; for you govern the peoples with equity, and guide the nations on earth. *Selah*
Psalms	67	5	Let the peoples praise you, O God, let the peoples, all of them, praise you.
Psalms	67	6	The earth has yielded her increase by the blessing of God, our God.
Psalms	67	7	May this blessing of ours win people to him to all the ends of the earth.
Psalms	68	1	God arises, his enemies scatter: they who hate him flee before him.
Psalms	68	2	As smoke before wind is driven, as wax melts before fire, so before God vanish the wicked.
Psalms	68	3	But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence, they exult with exceeding joy.
Psalms	68	4	Sing to God, make music to his name, his name is the LORD, praise him who rides on the clouds, and exult in his presence.
Psalms	68	5	Father of orphans, defender of widows, is God in his holy abode.
Psalms	68	6	God brings home the lonely, he leads forth the prisoner to comfort, so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.
Psalms	68	7	God, when you went in front of your people in your march through the desert, *Selah*
Psalms	68	8	earth shook, the heavens poured rain at the presence of God, Sinai’s God at the presence of God, Israel’s God.
Psalms	68	9	Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle, restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
Psalms	68	10	A dwelling therein your people found: in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.
Psalms	68	11	The LORD  spoke the glad tidings of victory, a great army of women proclaim it:
Psalms	68	12	“Kings of armies they flee, they flee, and the housewife divides the spoil:
Psalms	68	13	dove’s wings covered with silver and pinions with shimmer of gold,
Psalms	68	14	set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”
Psalms	68	15	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan, a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
Psalms	68	16	You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance at the mountain which God has desired for his home whereon the LORD  will live forever?
Psalms	68	17	The chariots of God are twice ten thousand: the LORD  came from Sinai, his holy place.
Psalms	68	18	You did mount the height with trains of your captives, and gifts that you had received from the people. The rebels shall live with the LORD  God.
Psalms	68	19	Blest be the LORD  who sustains us daily, the God who is also our savior. *Selah*
Psalms	68	20	Our God is a God who is savior. The ways of escape from death are known to the LORD  God.
Psalms	68	21	Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
Psalms	68	22	The LORD  said: “I will bring you home from Bashan, home from the depths of the sea,
Psalms	68	23	that your feet you may bathe in blood, and your dogs lick their share of the foe.”
Psalms	68	24	In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions, processions in praise of my king and my God,
Psalms	68	25	with singers in front, and minstrels behind, and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
Psalms	68	26	“You of the well-spring of Israel, bless the LORD  God in the dance.”
Psalms	68	27	There, in front, is Benjamin the little, the princes of Judah beside them, the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.
Psalms	68	28	God, show your strength, your godlike might, as you did in the past,
Psalms	68	29	from your temple that crowns Jerusalem. Kings shall bring tribute to you.
Psalms	68	30	Rebuke the beast of the reed, the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Trample down the lovers of lies. Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
Psalms	68	31	May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil, Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.
Psalms	68	32	Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth, make melody to the LORD . *Selah*
Psalms	68	33	Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens. See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
Psalms	68	34	Ascribe strength to the God over Israel, whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
Psalms	68	35	Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place, it is Israel’s God who gives strength and might to his people. Blessed be God.
Psalms	69	1	Save me, O God; for the waters are threatening my life.
Psalms	69	2	I am sunk in depths of mire, where ground there is none. I am come into deep deep waters, the flood overwhelms me.
Psalms	69	3	I am weary of crying, my throat is parched, my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.
Psalms	69	4	More than the hairs of my head are those who wantonly hate me. More than my bones in number are those who are falsely my foes. That which I never robbed, how am I then to restore?
Psalms	69	5	O God, you know my folly, my guilt is not hidden from you.
Psalms	69	6	Through me let not any be shamed, who wait for you, LORD  God of hosts. Through me let not those be confounded who seek you, O God of Israel.
Psalms	69	7	It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts, and my face has been covered with shame;
Psalms	69	8	I became to my kindred a foreigner, to my mother’s sons a stranger.
Psalms	69	9	It was zeal for your house that consumed me, and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
Psalms	69	10	When I chastened myself with fasting, they took occasion to taunt me.
Psalms	69	11	When I put on a garment of sackcloth, they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
Psalms	69	12	Those who sit in the gate make sport of me in the music of drunken songs.
Psalms	69	13	But I pray to you, LORD, for a time of favor. In your great love answer me; with your loyal help, save me
Psalms	69	14	from sinking down in the mire. Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
Psalms	69	15	that the rushing flood may not drown me, that the deep may not swallow me up, nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
Psalms	69	16	Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness, turn to me in your great compassion.
Psalms	69	17	Hide not your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
Psalms	69	18	Draw near to me, redeem me; because of my enemies, ransom me.
Psalms	69	19	You know how I am insulted; in your sight are all my foes.
Psalms	69	20	Insult has broken my heart, past cure are my shame and confusion. For pity I looked – there was none! And for comforters, but I found none.
Psalms	69	21	Poison they gave me for food, and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.
Psalms	69	22	May their table, outspread, be a trap to them, and their peace-offerings be a snare.
Psalms	69	23	May their eyes be darkened and blind, make them shake without ceasing.
Psalms	69	24	Pour your indignation upon them, let your burning wrath overtake them.
Psalms	69	25	May their camp be a desolation, in their tents be there none to live.
Psalms	69	26	For those whom you struck, they persecute, and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
Psalms	69	27	Charge them with sin upon sin, may they not be acquitted by you.
Psalms	69	28	From the book of life be they blotted, may their names not be written with the righteous.
Psalms	69	29	Lift me, O God, by your help above my pain and misery.
Psalms	69	30	Then will I praise God in song and magnify him with thanksgiving,
Psalms	69	31	which shall please the LORD  better than ox, or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
Psalms	69	32	The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight. You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
Psalms	69	33	For the LORD  listens to the poor, he does not despise his prisoners.
Psalms	69	34	Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises, the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
Psalms	69	35	For God will bring help to Zion, and build up the cities of Judah, his people shall live there in possession.
Psalms	69	36	His servants’ children shall have it for heritage, and those who love him shall live therein.
Psalms	70	1	Quickly, God, deliver me, hasten to help me, LORD .
Psalms	70	2	May those who are seeking my life, be ashamed and confounded.
Psalms	70	3	May those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonor.
Psalms	70	4	But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all who love your salvation say, “Glory to God,” evermore.
Psalms	70	5	I am weak and needy: make haste, God, to me. You are my help and deliverer; LORD, don’t delay.
Psalms	71	1	In you, O LORD, I take refuge, let me never be put to shame.
Psalms	71	2	In your faithfulness save me and rescue me, bend your ear to me and save me.
Psalms	71	3	Be to me a rock of defence, a fortified house, to save me; for my rock and my fortress are you.
Psalms	71	4	Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
Psalms	71	5	For you, LORD, are my hope, in whom from my youth I have trusted.
Psalms	71	6	On you have I leaned from my birth; from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me. In you is my hope evermore.
Psalms	71	7	I have been as a wonder to many, for you are my refuge and strength.
Psalms	71	8	All the day long my mouth is filled with your praise and your glory.
Psalms	71	9	Cast me not off in the time of old age; when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
Psalms	71	10	For my foes whisper against me, they who watch me take counsel together;
Psalms	71	11	“God has left him,” they say: “pursue and seize him, for he is helpless.”
Psalms	71	12	O God, be not far from me, haste, O my God, to my help.
Psalms	71	13	Put my foes to shame and dishonor, with insult and shame be they covered.
Psalms	71	14	But I will never stop hoping, and more and yet more will I praise you.
Psalms	71	15	All the day long shall my mouth tell your faithfulness and your salvation, though I know not how they may be counted.
Psalms	71	16	I will tell of the might of the LORD, and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
Psalms	71	17	You have taught me, O God, from my youth, and till now have I told of your wonders.
Psalms	71	18	Even in old age and grey hair, O God, do not forsake me. Still would I tell of your might unto all generations to come.
Psalms	71	19	Your power and your justice, O God, extend as far as the heavens: for great are the things you have done. Who is like you, O God?
Psalms	71	20	You have caused us to see troubles many, but you will revive us again. From the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
Psalms	71	21	You will multiply my greatness, and comfort me again.
Psalms	71	22	So with harp I will praise you, and your faithfulness, O my God; and make music to you on the lyre, O you Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	71	23	My lips shall ring out their joy, my mouth shall sing praises to you; all of me, which you have redeemed.
Psalms	71	24	Yes, all the day long shall my tongue utter your righteousness; for ashamed and confounded are they who were seeking my hurt.
Psalms	72	1	Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice your spirit of right to the son of the king,
Psalms	72	2	that with right he may judge your people, and your downtrodden ones with justice.
Psalms	72	3	May the mountains bear weal for the people, and the hills yield fruits of justice.
Psalms	72	4	The weak may he help to their rights, may he save the sons of the needy and crush the oppressor in pieces.
Psalms	72	5	May he live as long as the sun, while the moon shines – for ages and ages.
Psalms	72	6	May he be like the rain on the meadow, like showers that water the earth.
Psalms	72	7	In his days may justice flourish, and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
Psalms	72	8	May he reign from ocean to ocean, from the river to the ends of the earth.
Psalms	72	9	May his foes bow down before him, his enemies lick the dust.
Psalms	72	10	May tribute be rendered by kings of the isles and of Tarshish; may gifts be brought by the kings of Sheba and Seba.
Psalms	72	11	May all kings fall prostrate before him, and all nations yield him their service.
Psalms	72	12	For he saves the poor when he cries, the helpless and the downtrodden.
Psalms	72	13	He pities the weak and the poor, he saves the lives of the poor.
Psalms	72	14	He redeems them from wrong and from violence, for dear is their blood in his sight.
Psalms	72	15	Long may he live; and may gold of Sheba be given him; prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly, all the day long may men bless him.
Psalms	72	16	May the land have abundance of corn, to the tops of the hills may it wave. May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon, may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.
Psalms	72	17	May his name be blessed forever, may his fame endure as the sun. May all nations envy his blessedness, all tribes of the earth call him happy.
Psalms	72	18	*Blest be the LORD  God, Israel’s God,* *who alone does wonders;*
Psalms	72	19	*And blest be forever his glorious name.* *Let all the earth be filled with his glory.* *Amen and Amen.*
Psalms	72	20	Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.
Psalms	73	1	Yes, God is good to the upright, the LORD  to the pure in heart.
Psalms	73	2	But my feet were almost gone, my steps had nearly slipped,
Psalms	73	3	through envy of godless braggarts, when I saw how well they fared.
Psalms	73	4	For never a pang have they, their body is sound and sleek.
Psalms	73	5	They have no trouble like mortals, no share in human pain.
Psalms	73	6	So they wear their pride like a necklace, they put on the garment of wrong,
Psalms	73	7	their eyes stand out with fatness, their heart swells with riotous fancies.
Psalms	73	8	Their speech is mocking and evil, condescending and crooked their speech.
Psalms	73	9	They have set their mouth in the heavens, while their tongue struts about on the earth.
Psalms	73	10	Small wonder that people resort to them, and drink deep draughts of their lore.
Psalms	73	11	“How does God know?” they say, “And has the Most High any knowledge?”
Psalms	73	12	See! These are the godless, with wealth and ease ever increasing.
Psalms	73	13	Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence;
Psalms	73	14	for all the day long was I plagued not a morning but I was chastised.
Psalms	73	15	But to resolve to speak like they do would be treachery to your children.
Psalms	73	16	So I sought to understand it, but a wearisome task it seemed:
Psalms	73	17	till I entered the holy world of God and saw clearly their destiny.
Psalms	73	18	Yes, you set them on slippery places; down to destruction you hurl them.
Psalms	73	19	One moment and then what a horror of ruin! They are finished and ended in terrors.
Psalms	73	20	Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be, whose phantoms the waker despises.
Psalms	73	21	So my bitterness of mind and the pain that stabbed my heart
Psalms	73	22	show how dull I was and stupid just like a beast before you.
Psalms	73	23	But I am always with you, you have hold of my right hand.
Psalms	73	24	By a plan of yours you guide me and will afterward take me to glory.
Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in the heavens but you? And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
Psalms	73	26	Though flesh and heart waste away, yet God is the rock of my heart, yet God is my portion forever.
Psalms	73	27	For see! Those who are far from you must perish, you destroy all who are false to you.
Psalms	73	28	But I am happy when close to God; the LORD  my God I have made my refuge, that I may recount all the things you have done.
Psalms	74	1	Why, O God, have you spurned us forever? Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
Psalms	74	2	Remember the community you purchased of old to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage, Zion, the mountain you made your home.
Psalms	74	3	Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete. In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.
Psalms	74	4	Like lions your enemies roared through your house, replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
Psalms	74	5	hacking, like woodsmen who lift axes on thickets of trees,
Psalms	74	6	smashing with hatchets and hammers all of its carved work together.
Psalms	74	7	They have set your temple on fire, to the very ground they have outraged the place where lives your name.
Psalms	74	8	They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.” They have burned all the houses of God in the land.
Psalms	74	9	No symbol of ours do we see any more: no prophet is there any more, none is with us who knows how long.
Psalms	74	10	How long, O God, is the foe to insult? Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
Psalms	74	11	Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand, why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?
Psalms	74	12	Yet God is our king from the ancient days, in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
Psalms	74	13	It was you who did cleave the sea by your might, and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
Psalms	74	14	It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan, and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
Psalms	74	15	It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents; it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
Psalms	74	16	Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night, it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
Psalms	74	17	It was you who did fix all the borders of earth: summer and winter it’s you who have made them.
Psalms	74	18	Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD, and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
Psalms	74	19	Do not give your dove to the beasts, do not forget your afflicted forever.
Psalms	74	20	Look to the sleek ones – how full they are: the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
Psalms	74	21	O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed: let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.
Psalms	74	22	Arise, God, and defend your cause: remember how fools all the day insult you.
Psalms	74	23	Do not forget the uproar of your enemies, the din of your foes that ascends evermore.
Psalms	75	1	We praise you, God, we praise you: we would call on your name and declare your wonders.
Psalms	75	2	“At the time I choose, I will judge fairly.
Psalms	75	3	Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.” *Selah*
Psalms	75	4	I say to the boasters, “Boast not”; to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:
Psalms	75	5	lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.”
Psalms	75	6	For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains;
Psalms	75	7	but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another.
Psalms	75	8	In the hand of the LORD  is a cup foaming wine, richly spiced. Out of this he pours a draught, and all the wicked of earth must drain it down to the dregs.
Psalms	75	9	But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob.
Psalms	75	10	I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.
Psalms	76	1	God has made himself known in Judah, his name is great in Israel.
Psalms	76	2	His tent is in Salem, his dwelling in Zion.
Psalms	76	3	There he broke the lightning arrows, shield, sword, and weapons of war. *Selah*
Psalms	76	4	Terrible is your splendor on the everlasting mountains.
Psalms	76	5	Despoiled were the stout of heart; in the sleep into which they had fallen, none of the warriors could lift a hand.
Psalms	76	6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob, sank chariot and horse to sleep.
Psalms	76	7	Awful are you: who can stand before you, when once you are angry?
Psalms	76	8	The judgment you gave from heaven frightened the earth into silence,
Psalms	76	9	when God arose to judgment to save the oppressed of the earth. *Selah*
Psalms	76	10	The fiercest will praise you, to you will the remnant hold festival.
Psalms	76	11	Vow and pay to LORD  your God, and let all who are round him bring presents.
Psalms	76	12	He lops off the courage of princes, and with terror fills kings of the earth.
Psalms	77	1	Loudly will I lift my cry to God, loudly to God, so he hears to me.
Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD ; in the night I lift my hands in prayer, refusing all comfort.
Psalms	77	3	When I think of God, I moan; when I muse, my spirit is faint. *Selah*
Psalms	77	4	When you hold my eyes awake, and I am restless and speechless,
Psalms	77	5	I think of the days of old, call to mind distant years.
Psalms	77	6	I commune with my heart in the night, I muse with inquiring spirit.
Psalms	77	7	“Will the LORD  cast us off forever, will he be gracious no more?
Psalms	77	8	Has his love vanished forever? Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious, or in anger withheld his compassion?” *Selah*
Psalms	77	10	Then I said, “This it is that grieves me, that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
Psalms	77	11	I will think of the deeds of the LORD, and remember your wonders of old.
Psalms	77	12	I will muse on all you have wrought, and meditate on your deeds.
Psalms	77	13	Then your way, O God, was majestic: what God was great as our God?
Psalms	77	14	You were a God who did marvels, you did show your power to the world
Psalms	77	15	by your arm you rescued your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. *Selah*
Psalms	77	16	The waters saw you, O God. The waters saw you and shivered; to their depths they trembled.
Psalms	77	17	Clouds poured torrents of water, thunder rolled in the sky, your arrows sped to and fro.
Psalms	77	18	Loud was the roll of your thunder, lightnings lit up the world. Earth quaked and trembled.
Psalms	77	19	In your way, LORD, through the sea, in your path through the mighty waters, your footsteps were all unseen.
Psalms	77	20	You did guide your folk like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalms	78	1	My people, attend to my teaching: bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
Psalms	78	2	as I open my mouth in a poem on the riddling story of the past.
Psalms	78	3	What we have heard and known, and what our ancestors have told us,
Psalms	78	4	we will not hide from their children. We will tell to the next generation the praises and might of the LORD, and the wonders that he has done.
Psalms	78	5	He set up a testimony in Jacob, a law he appointed in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to make known to their children,
Psalms	78	6	that the next generation should know it, that the children yet to be born should arise and tell their children;
Psalms	78	7	that in God they might put their confidence, and not forget God’s works; but that they might keep his commandments,
Psalms	78	8	and not be like their ancestors, a generation defiant and stubborn, a generation with heart unsteady, and spirit unfaithful towards God.
Psalms	78	9	Ephraimites, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms	78	10	They did not keep God’s covenant, they refused to walk in his law.
Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done, and the wonders he had shown them.
Psalms	78	12	He did wonders before their ancestors in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
Psalms	78	13	Through the sea which he split he brought them, making waters stand up like a heap;
Psalms	78	14	he led them by day with a cloud, all the night with a light of fire.
Psalms	78	15	From the rocks which he split in the wilderness, he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
Psalms	78	16	He brought streams out of the rock, and made water run down like rivers.
Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on sinning against him, they defied the Most High in the desert.
Psalms	78	18	They willfully challenged God, demanding the food that they longed for.
Psalms	78	19	“Is God able,” such was their challenge, “to spread in the desert a table?
Psalms	78	20	From the rock that he struck there gushed water, and torrents that overflowed; but can he also give bread, or provide his people with meat?”
Psalms	78	21	When the LORD  heard this, he was furious, and fire was kindled on Jacob, anger flared up against Israel.
Psalms	78	22	For they put no trust in God, no confidence in his help.
Psalms	78	23	So he summoned the clouds above; and, opening the doors of heaven,
Psalms	78	24	he rained manna upon them for food, and grain of heaven he gave them.
Psalms	78	25	Everyone ate the bread of angels; he sent them food to the full.
Psalms	78	26	He launched the east wind in the heavens, and guided the south by his power.
Psalms	78	27	He rained meat upon them like dust, winged bird like the sand of the sea.
Psalms	78	28	In the midst of their camp he dropped it, all around their tents.
Psalms	78	29	They ate and were more than filled; he had brought them the thing they desired.
Psalms	78	30	But the thing they desired became loathsome: while their food was still in their mouths,
Psalms	78	31	the wrath of God rose against them. He slew the stoutest among them, and laid low the young men of Israel.
Psalms	78	32	Yet for all this they sinned yet more, and refused to believe in his wonders.
Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days in a breath, and their years in sudden dismay.
Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they sought after him, they turned and sought God with diligence.
Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.
Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
Psalms	78	37	Their heart was not steady with him, they were faithless to his covenant.
Psalms	78	38	But he is full of pity: he pardons sin and destroys not. Often he turns his anger away, without stirring his wrath at all.
Psalms	78	39	So he remembered that they were but flesh, breath that passes and does not return.
Psalms	78	40	But how often they rebelled in the desert, and caused him grief in the wilderness,
Psalms	78	41	tempting God again and again, provoking the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	78	42	They did not remember his strength, nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt, in the country of Zoan his wonders.
Psalms	78	44	He turned their canals into blood, their streams undrinkable.
Psalms	78	45	He sent forth flies, which devoured them; frogs, too, which destroyed them.
Psalms	78	46	Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
Psalms	78	47	He slew their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
Psalms	78	48	He delivered their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.
Psalms	78	49	He let loose his hot anger among them, fury and wrath and distress, a band of destroying angels.
Psalms	78	50	He cleared a path for his anger, did not spare them from death, but gave them over to pestilence.
Psalms	78	51	He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms	78	52	He led forth his people like sheep, he was guide to his flock in the desert.
Psalms	78	53	Securely he led them, and free from fear, while their foes were drowned in the sea.
Psalms	78	54	To his holy realm he brought them, to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations before them, and allotted their land for possession, and their tents for Israel to live in.
Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, they did not observe his decrees.
Psalms	78	57	They drew back, false like their ancestors; they failed like a treacherous bow.
Psalms	78	58	Their shrines stirred him to anger, their idols moved him to jealousy.
Psalms	78	59	When God heard of this, he was furious, and he spurned Israel utterly.
Psalms	78	60	He abandoned his home in Shiloh, the tent he had pitched among people.
Psalms	78	61	He gave his strength up to captivity, his glory to the hands of the foe.
Psalms	78	62	He gave his people to the sword, he was furious with his own.
Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage-song.
Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.
Psalms	78	65	Then the LORD  awoke as from sleep, like a warrior flushed with wine;
Psalms	78	66	and he beat back his foes, putting them to perpetual scorn.
Psalms	78	67	He disowned the tent of Joseph, he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
Psalms	78	68	but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
Psalms	78	69	And he built like the heights his sanctuary, like the earth which he founded forever.
Psalms	78	70	And he chose David his servant, taking him from the sheepfolds.
Psalms	78	71	From the mother-ewes he brought him, to be shepherd to Jacob his people, and to Israel his inheritance.
Psalms	78	72	With upright heart did he shepherd them, and with skilful hands did he guide them.
Psalms	79	1	Heathen, O God, have come into your land, defiling your holy temple, and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
Psalms	79	2	They have given the bodies of your dead servants to the birds of the air to devour, and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
Psalms	79	3	Round about Jerusalem they have poured out their blood like water; and there was no one to bury them.
Psalms	79	4	On every side our neighbors revile us and mock us and jeer at us.
Psalms	79	5	How long will you be angry, O LORD ? Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
Psalms	79	7	For Jacob they devoured, they have desolated his home.
Psalms	79	8	Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins; O meet us soon with your pity, for utterly weak are we.
Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God our savior, for the renown of your name: for your reputation deliver us and cover over our sins.
Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
Psalms	79	11	May the groans of the prisoner come before you; free the children of death by your mighty arm.
Psalms	79	12	Pay our neighbors back sevenfold for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD .
Psalms	79	13	Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you for evermore, and tell your praise to all generations.
Psalms	80	1	Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep; from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
Psalms	80	2	before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin. Stir up your mighty power, come to our help.
Psalms	80	3	God, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
Psalms	80	4	O LORD  of hosts, how long is your anger to smoke, despite the prayer of your people?
Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with bread of tears, you have made them drink tears by the measure.
Psalms	80	6	The scorn of our neighbors you make us, the laughing-stock of our foes.
Psalms	80	7	God of hosts, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
Psalms	80	8	A vine out of Egypt you brought; you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
Psalms	80	9	in the ground you did clear she struck root, and she filled all the land.
Psalms	80	10	The shade of her covered the mountains, her branches the cedars of God.
Psalms	80	11	She sent forth her shoots to the sea, and her branches as far as the River.
Psalms	80	12	Why have you torn down her fences, and left her to be plucked at by all who pass by,
Psalms	80	13	to be gnawed by the boar from the forest, and devoured by the beasts of the field?
Psalms	80	14	O God of hosts, return: look down from heaven and see and visit this vine, and restore her
Psalms	80	15	the vine which your right hand has planted.
Psalms	80	16	She is burned with fire and cut down before your stern face they are perishing.
Psalms	80	17	Support the one you have chosen, the one you have raised for yourself;
Psalms	80	18	then from you we will never draw back. Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
Psalms	80	19	LORD, God of hosts, restore us: Show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
Psalms	81	1	Sing aloud to God our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, sound the timbrel, sweet lyre and harp.
Psalms	81	3	On the new moon blow the horn, at the full moon, the day of our festival.
Psalms	81	4	For this is a statute for Israel, a ruling of the God of Jacob,
Psalms	81	5	a witness he set up in Joseph, when he marched against Egypt’s land, where he heard an unknown voice say:
Psalms	81	6	“I removed from your shoulder the burden, and freed your hands from the basket.
Psalms	81	7	At your call of distress I delivered you, from the thundercloud I answered you. At Meribah’s waters I tested you. *Selah*
Psalms	81	8	“Listen, my people, to my warning, O Israel, if you would but listen!
Psalms	81	9	There must not be a strange god among you, you must bow to no foreign god.
Psalms	81	10	I am the LORD  your God who brought you up out of Egypt. Open your mouth, that I fill it.
Psalms	81	11	“But my people did not listen to my voice, Israel would have none of me.
Psalms	81	12	So to their own hard hearts I left them, to follow their own devices.
Psalms	81	13	O that my people would listen, that Israel would walk in my ways.
Psalms	81	14	Soon would I humble their enemies, and turn my hand on their foes.
Psalms	81	15	Those who hate the LORD  would cringe before him in everlasting terror.
Psalms	81	16	But you would I feed with the richest wheat, and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.”
Psalms	82	1	God has taken his stand in the divine assembly: in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
Psalms	82	2	“How long will you crookedly judge, and favor the wicked? *Selah*
Psalms	82	3	Do right by the weak and the orphan, acquit the innocent poor.
Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked.
Psalms	82	5	“They have neither knowledge nor insight, in darkness they walk to and fro, while the earth’s foundations totter.
Psalms	82	6	It was I who appointed you gods, children of the Most High all of you.
Psalms	82	7	Yet like mortals you will surely die, you will fall like any prince.”
Psalms	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all nations are yours by inheritance.
Psalms	83	1	Do not keep silent, O God: hold not your peace, be not still, God.
Psalms	83	2	For see! Your enemies roar, those who hate you lift up their heads,
Psalms	83	3	laying crafty plans for your people, and plotting against those you treasure.
Psalms	83	4	“Come, let us wipe them out as a nation, so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”
Psalms	83	5	For, conspiring with one accord, they have made a league against you
Psalms	83	6	Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagrites.
Psalms	83	7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
Psalms	83	8	Syria, too, is confederate, they have strengthened the children of Lot. *Selah*
Psalms	83	9	Deal with them as you dealt with Midian, with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
Psalms	83	10	who at Endor were destroyed, and became dung for the field.
Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Psalms	83	12	who said, “Let us take for ourselves the meadows of God.”
Psalms	83	13	Whirl them, my God, like dust, like stubble before the wind.
Psalms	83	14	As the fire that kindles the forest, as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
Psalms	83	15	so with your tempest pursue them, terrify them with your hurricane.
Psalms	83	16	Make them blush with shame; until they seek your name, O LORD .
Psalms	83	17	Everlasting shame and confusion, disgrace and destruction be theirs.
Psalms	83	18	Teach those who you alone are most high over all the earth.
Psalms	84	1	How dearly loved is the place where you live, LORD  of hosts!
Psalms	84	2	How I long and yearn for the courts of the LORD . Now heart and flesh cry for joy to the living God.
Psalms	84	3	Even the sparrow has found her a home and the swallow a nest, to lay her young, near your altar, LORD  of hosts, my king and my God.
Psalms	84	4	Happy those who live in your house, praising you evermore. *Selah*
Psalms	84	5	Happy those whose strength is in you, people with pilgrim hearts.
Psalms	84	6	As they pass through the valley of tears, they make it a place of fountains, clothed with the blessings of early rain.
Psalms	84	7	From rampart to rampart on they march, till at last God reveals himself in Zion.
Psalms	84	8	LORD, God of hosts, hear my prayer, attend, O God of Jacob. *Selah*
Psalms	84	9	Behold, O God, our defender, and look upon your anointed,
Psalms	84	10	for better a single day in your courts than a thousand in my own chambers: better stand at the door of the house of my God than live in the tents of ungodliness,
Psalms	84	11	for the LORD  is sun and shield, the LORD  gives grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from the life that is blameless.
Psalms	84	12	LORD  of hosts, happy those whose trust is in you.
Psalms	85	1	Once, LORD, you did favor your land, granting change of fortune to Jacob,
Psalms	85	2	forgiving the guilt of your people, pardoning all their sin, *Selah*
Psalms	85	3	withdrawing all your fury, turning from your hot anger.
Psalms	85	4	Restore us, O God our savior, put away your displeasure against us.
Psalms	85	5	Will you cherish your anger against us forever, prolonging your wrath to all generations?
Psalms	85	6	Will you not revive us again, that your people may be glad in you?
Psalms	85	7	Show us your kindness, O LORD, grant us your salvation.
Psalms	85	8	Let me hear what God the LORD  will speak; for he will speak of peace to his people, to those who love him, and turn their hearts to him.
Psalms	85	9	Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves, and glory shall live in our land.
Psalms	85	10	Kindness and loyalty meet; peace and righteousness kiss.
Psalms	85	11	Loyalty springs from the earth; righteousness looks from the sky.
Psalms	85	12	The LORD  shall give all that is good, our land yielding its increase,
Psalms	85	13	righteousness marching before him, and peace on the path he treads.
Psalms	86	1	Incline your ear, LORD, and answer me, for I am afflicted and needy.
Psalms	86	2	Guard me, for I am loyal: save your servant, who trusts in you.
Psalms	86	3	LORD, be gracious to me, for you are my God; I cry to you all the day.
Psalms	86	4	Gladden the heart of your servant; for to you, LORD, I set my hope.
Psalms	86	5	For you, LORD, are good and forgiving, rich in love towards all who call on you.
Psalms	86	6	Listen, O LORD, to my prayer; attend to my plea for mercy.
Psalms	86	7	In the day of my trouble I call on you, with assurance that you will answer me.
Psalms	86	8	None of the gods is like you, LORD, nor are any works like yours.
Psalms	86	9	All the nations you have made will come and bow down before you, giving glory, O LORD, to your name.
Psalms	86	10	For great are you, and a doer of wonders; you alone are God.
Psalms	86	11	Teach me, O LORD, your way, that I may walk in your truth: so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
Psalms	86	12	I will give you thanks, O LORD, with all my heart, my God, I will honor your name forever.
Psalms	86	13	For great is your love towards me, from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.
Psalms	86	14	Haughty men have risen up against me, O God, a band of the violent seeking my life, who think nothing of you.
Psalms	86	15	But you are a God of pity and grace, patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness; turn to me with your grace, O LORD .
Psalms	86	16	Grant your strength to your servant, and save the child of your handmaid.
Psalms	86	17	Show me a sign of your favor, which those who hate me may see with confusion, since you, LORD, are my helper and comforter.
Psalms	87	1	On the holy mountain stands the city he founded.
Psalms	87	2	The LORD  loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Psalms	87	3	Glorious things he is speaking of you, you city of God. *Selah*
Psalms	87	4	“Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia, their people will say I was born in Zion.
Psalms	87	5	As for Zion it will be said each and all were born in her.” The LORD  will preserve her.
Psalms	87	6	The LORD  will count, when enrolling the peoples, “This one was born there, and that one was born there.” *Selah*
Psalms	87	7	Singers and dancers alike will say “All my springs are in you.”
Psalms	88	1	O LORD  my God, I cry for help in the day-time, in the night my cry is before you;
Psalms	88	2	let my prayer come into your presence, incline your ear to my cry.
Psalms	88	3	For I am sated with sorrow, my life draws near to Sheol.
Psalms	88	4	I am counted with those who go down to the pit; without strength am I.
Psalms	88	5	My home is among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more cut off as they are from your hand.
Psalms	88	6	In the deepest pit you have put me, in shadows deep and dark.
Psalms	88	7	Your wrath lies heavy upon me, waves of your anger roll over me. *Selah*
Psalms	88	8	You have put my friends far from me, you have made them shun me. I am shut in, and cannot escape,
Psalms	88	9	my eyes are wasted with sorrow. I call on you, LORD, every day, spreading my hands out to you.
Psalms	88	10	For the dead can you work wonders? Can the shades rise again to praise you? *Selah*
Psalms	88	11	Can your kindness be told in the grave, your faithfulness in the tomb?
Psalms	88	12	Can your wonders be known in the darkness, or your help in the land of forgetfulness?
Psalms	88	13	I cry for help to you, in the morning my prayer comes before you.
Psalms	88	14	Why, O LORD, do you spurn me, and hide your face from me?
Psalms	88	15	From my youth I am wretched and dying, I am numbed by the terrors I bear.
Psalms	88	16	The fires of your wrath have passed over me, your terrors destroy me,
Psalms	88	17	surging around me forever, hemming me in altogether.
Psalms	88	18	Those who love me you put far from me; the dark is my only friend.
Psalms	89	1	I will sing evermore of the love of the LORD, proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
Psalms	89	2	For your love you did promise to build up forever, your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.
Psalms	89	3	“I have made with my chosen a covenant, and sworn to David my servant,
Psalms	89	4	to establish his seed forever, and to build up his throne to all ages.” *Selah*
Psalms	89	5	Then the holy assembly in heaven praised your marvelous faithfulness, LORD .
Psalms	89	6	For who in the skies may compare with the LORD ? Who is like the LORD  among the gods?
Psalms	89	7	A God to be feared in the holy assembly, awful and great above all who are round him.
Psalms	89	8	O LORD  God of hosts, who is mighty as you? Your strength and faithfulness, LORD, surround you.
Psalms	89	9	You are the LORD  of the raging sea: when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
Psalms	89	10	It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces, and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.
Psalms	89	11	Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth, the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
Psalms	89	12	The north and the south, it’s you have created them; Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.
Psalms	89	13	You have an arm with the might of a hero; strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
Psalms	89	14	Justice and right are the base of your throne, kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.
Psalms	89	15	Happy the people who know the glad shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face.
Psalms	89	16	They exult in your name all the day, and your righteousness they extol.
Psalms	89	17	For you are our strength and our pride. Your favor will lift us to honor.
Psalms	89	18	For the holy LORD  of Israel keeps our defender and king.
Psalms	89	19	In a vision of old you did speak in this way to the one whom you loved: “A crown I have set on the hero I chose to be over the people
Psalms	89	20	“I found my servant David, and anointed with holy oil.
Psalms	89	21	My hand will be with him forever, my arm will give him strength.
Psalms	89	22	“No enemy will dare to assail him, nor the wicked to oppress him;
Psalms	89	23	but his foes I will shatter before him, I will strike down those who hate him.
Psalms	89	24	“My loyal love shall attend him, and I will lift him to honor.
Psalms	89	25	I will set his hand on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.
Psalms	89	26	“As for him, he will call me ‘My father, my God, and my rock of salvation.’
Psalms	89	27	And I will make him my firstborn, highest of kings on the earth.
Psalms	89	28	“My love will I keep for him ever, my covenant with him shall stand fast.
Psalms	89	29	His line will I make everlasting, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
Psalms	89	30	“If his children forsake my law, and walk not as I have ordained;
Psalms	89	31	if they profane my statutes, and do not keep my commandments;
Psalms	89	32	“I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with scourges.
Psalms	89	33	But my love will I not take from him, nor will I belie my faithfulness.
Psalms	89	34	“I will not profane my covenant by changing the word that has passed my lips.
Psalms	89	35	Once have I solemnly sworn and I would not lie to David,
Psalms	89	36	“that his line should endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me,
Psalms	89	37	firm as the moon which for ever and ever is fixed in the sky.” *Selah*
Psalms	89	38	But you have cast off in contempt, and been furious with your anointed.
Psalms	89	39	You have spurned the covenant with your servant, and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.
Psalms	89	40	You have broken down all his walls, and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
Psalms	89	41	All who pass on their way despoil him, the scorn of his neighbors is he now.
Psalms	89	42	You have given his foes the victory, and made all his enemies glad.
Psalms	89	43	You have turned back his sword from the foe, you did not lift him up in the battle.
Psalms	89	44	The sceptre you took from his hand, and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
Psalms	89	45	You have shortened the days of his youth, and covered him with shame. *Selah*
Psalms	89	46	How long, LORD  will you hide you forever? How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
Psalms	89	47	Remember, LORD, the shortness of life how fleeting you made all people.
Psalms	89	48	Who can live without seeing death? Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? *Selah*
Psalms	89	49	Where, LORD, is your kindness of old, which you in your faithfulness swore to David?
Psalms	89	50	Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked, how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
Psalms	89	51	The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD, which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.
Psalms	89	52	*Blest be the LORD, for ever and ever.* *Amen and Amen.*
Psalms	90	1	LORD, you have been a home to us one generation after another.
Psalms	90	2	Before the mountains were born, or the earth and the world were brought forth, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
Psalms	90	3	You bring us back to the dust, you summon mortals to return.
Psalms	90	4	For you see a thousand years as the passing of yesterday, as a watch in the night.
Psalms	90	5	Your floods sweep them away; they are like a dream, or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
Psalms	90	6	which blossoms and sprouts in the morning, but by evening is cut and withered.
Psalms	90	7	For your anger consumes us, the heat of your wrath confounds us.
Psalms	90	8	Our sins you have set before you, our secrets in the light of your face.
Psalms	90	9	For through your wrath our days are declining, we bring our years to an end as a sigh.
Psalms	90	10	The span of our life is seventy years, or, if we are strong, maybe eighty; yet is their breadth but empty toil, for swiftly they go, and we fly away.
Psalms	90	11	Who lays to heart the power of your anger? Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
Psalms	90	12	O teach us to count our days so our minds may learn wisdom.
Psalms	90	13	Return, O LORD ; why so long? Relent on your servants.
Psalms	90	14	Grant us your love to the full in the morning, that all our days we may shout for joy.

Psalms	90	16	Let your servants see you in action, show your majesty to their children.
Psalms	90	17	Let the grace of the LORD  our God be upon us, uphold what our hands are striving to do.
Psalms	91	1	You whose home is the shelter of God Most High, whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
Psalms	91	2	can say to the LORD, “My refuge, my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”
Psalms	91	3	For he saves you from fowler’s snare, from deadly plague,
Psalms	91	4	he shelters you with his pinions, and under his wings you can hide.  His truth will be a shield and buckler.
Psalms	91	5	You need not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
Psalms	91	6	nor the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the pestilence raging at noon.
Psalms	91	7	A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand: but it will not draw near to you.
Psalms	91	8	You will only look on with your eyes, and see how the wicked are punished.
Psalms	91	9	You have made the LORD  your refuge, you have made the Most High your defence.
Psalms	91	10	You will never be met by misfortune, no plague will come near your tent,
Psalms	91	11	for he orders his angels to guard you, wherever you go.
Psalms	91	12	They will carry you with their hands, so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
Psalms	91	13	You will trample down lions and snakes, tread on young lions and cobras.
Psalms	91	14	“Because of their love for me, I will deliver them, I will protect those who trust my name.
Psalms	91	15	I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble, bringing them forth into safety and honor.
Psalms	91	16	I will give them a life of many days, I will show them my salvation.”
Psalms	92	1	It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
Psalms	92	2	to declare your love in the morning, and your faithfulness in the night,
Psalms	92	3	with voice and a ten-stringed harp, with music that throbs on the lyre.
Psalms	92	4	For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD, at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
Psalms	92	5	How great are your works, O LORD ; how deep are your thoughts!
Psalms	92	6	The insensitive cannot know, nor can a fool understand,
Psalms	92	7	that, though the wicked flourish like grass, and evildoers all blossom, they will perish forever.
Psalms	92	8	But you are exalted forever.
Psalms	92	9	For see! Your enemies, LORD For see! Your enemies perish, all evildoers are scattered.
Psalms	92	10	But you lift me to honor, and anoint me afresh with oil.
Psalms	92	11	My eyes will feast on my foes, and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
Psalms	92	12	The righteous will sprout like the palm, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
Psalms	92	13	In the house of the LORD  are they planted, in the courts of our God they will sprout.

Psalms	94	2	Rise up, judge of the earth, pay back the proud what they deserve.
Psalms	94	3	LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult,
Psalms	94	4	with their blustering arrogant words, their braggart and wicked speech,
Psalms	94	5	crushing your people, LORD, and afflicting your heritage,
Psalms	94	6	murdering widows and strangers, slaying the fatherless?
Psalms	94	7	They think that the LORD  does not see, nor the God of Jacob regard it.
Psalms	94	8	Take heed, you dullest of people; when will you be wise, you fools?
Psalms	94	9	Is he deaf, who shaped the ear? Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
Psalms	94	10	Can he who trains nations not punish them he who teaches knowledge to people?
Psalms	94	11	The LORD  knows the thoughts of people, that only a breath are they.
Psalms	94	12	Happy are those whom you chasten, and teach out of your law,
Psalms	94	13	keeping them calm in the day of misfortune, till a pit be dug for the wicked.
Psalms	94	14	For the LORD  will not leave his people, he will not forsake his inheritance.
Psalms	94	15	For the righteous shall come to their rights, and all true-hearted people shall follow them.
Psalms	94	16	Who will rise up for me against those who do evil? Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
Psalms	94	17	Were it not for the help of the LORD, I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
Psalms	94	18	When I thought that my foot was slipping, your kindness, LORD, held me up.
Psalms	94	19	When with cares my heart was crowded, your comforts make me glad.
Psalms	94	20	Can corrupt justice be your ally, framing mischief by statute?
Psalms	94	21	They assail the life of the righteous, and innocent blood condemn.
Psalms	94	22	But the LORD  is my sure retreat, my God is the rock of my refuge.
Psalms	94	23	He will bring back their sin upon them, for their wickedness he will destroy them; the LORD  our God will destroy them.

Psalms	103	11	For high as the heavens o’er the earth is his love over those who fear him.
Psalms	103	12	Far as is east from the west has he put our transgressions from us.
Psalms	103	13	As a father pities his children, so the LORD  pities those who fear him;
Psalms	103	14	for well he knows our frame, he remembers that we are dust.
Psalms	103	15	A person’s days are as grass; blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
Psalms	103	16	At the breath of the wind it is gone, and the place thereof knows it no more.

Psalms	104	1	Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD  my God, you are very great, clad in awful splendor,
Psalms	104	2	covered with robe of light. You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
Psalms	104	3	He lays the beams of his chambers on water. He takes dark clouds for his chariot, and rides on the wings of the wind.
Psalms	104	4	He takes the winds for his messengers, the fire and the flame for his servants.
Psalms	104	5	He founded the earth upon pillars, to sustain it unshaken forever.
Psalms	104	6	With the garment of ocean he covered it, waters towered over the mountains.
Psalms	104	7	But at your rebuke they fled, scared by the roar of your thunder,
Psalms	104	8	mountains rose, valleys sank down to the place appointed for them.
Psalms	104	9	They dared not pass the bounds set for them, or cover the earth any more.
Psalms	104	10	He sent brooks into the valleys, they meander between the mountains.
Psalms	104	11	The wild beasts all drink from them, and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Psalms	104	12	The birds have their home by the banks, and sing in the branches.
Psalms	104	13	From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains, and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.
Psalms	104	14	He makes grass grow for the cattle, and herbs for people. He brings bread out of the earth;
Psalms	104	15	wine, to gladden hearts; oil, to make faces shine; bread, to strengthen hearts.
Psalms	104	16	The trees of the LORD  drink their fill the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
Psalms	104	17	where the little birds build their nest, and the stork whose home is the cypress.
Psalms	104	18	The high hills are for the wild goats, and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.
Psalms	104	19	He created the moon to mark seasons, and told the sun when to set.
Psalms	104	20	You make it dark: night comes, when all the wild beasts creep out.
Psalms	104	21	Young lions that roar for their prey, seeking their meat from God.
Psalms	104	22	At sunrise they slink away, and lie down in their dens.
Psalms	104	23	Then people go forth to their work, and toil till evening.
Psalms	104	24	How many, O LORD, are your works, all of them made in wisdom! The earth is filled with your creatures.
Psalms	104	25	And there is the great broad sea, where are countless things in motion, living creatures, both great and small.
Psalms	104	26	There go the ships, and the Leviathan you made to play there.
Psalms	104	27	They all look in hope to you, to give them their food in due season.
Psalms	104	28	And you give with open hand; they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
Psalms	104	29	When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take their breath away, they die and go back to their dust.
Psalms	104	30	But a breath from your lips creates them, and renews the face of the earth.
Psalms	104	31	May the glory of the LORD  be forever, may the LORD  rejoice in his works.
Psalms	104	32	A glance of his makes the earth tremble, a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
Psalms	104	33	I will sing to the LORD  while I live, I will play to my God while I am.
Psalms	104	34	May my musing be sweet to him, for I rejoice in the LORD .
Psalms	104	35	But may sinners be swept from the earth, and the wicked vanish forever. O my soul, bless the LORD . Hallelujah.
Psalms	105	1	Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name: make known his deeds among the nations.
Psalms	105	2	Sing to him, make music to him, tell of all his wondrous works.
Psalms	105	3	Make your boast in his holy name, be glad at heart, you who seek the LORD .
Psalms	105	4	Seek after the LORD  and his strength, seek his face evermore.
Psalms	105	5	Remember the wonders he did, his portents, the judgments he uttered,
Psalms	105	6	you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant, the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
Psalms	105	7	He is the LORD  our God: in all the earth are his judgments.
Psalms	105	8	He remembers forever his covenant, his promise for a thousand generations
Psalms	105	9	The covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac,
Psalms	105	10	and confirmed as a statute to Jacob, a pact everlasting to Israel
Psalms	105	11	to give them the land of Canaan as the lot which they should inherit.
Psalms	105	12	And when they were very few, few and but pilgrims therein,
Psalms	105	13	wandering from nation to nation, journeying from people to people,
Psalms	105	14	he allowed no one to oppress them, even punishing kings for their sakes.
Psalms	105	15	He forbade them to touch his anointed, or do any hurt to his prophets.
Psalms	105	16	When he called down famine on the land, and cut off the bread which sustained them,
Psalms	105	17	he sent before them a man, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
Psalms	105	18	His feet were galled with fetters, he was laid in chains of iron,
Psalms	105	19	till the time that his word came to pass, the word of the LORD  that had tried him.
Psalms	105	20	The king sent and freed him, the ruler of nations released him.
Psalms	105	21	He made him lord of his household, and ruler of all his possessions,
Psalms	105	22	to admonish his princes at will and instruct his elders in wisdom.
Psalms	105	23	Thus Israel came into Egypt, Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	24	His people he made very fruitful, and mightier than their foes.
Psalms	105	25	He inspired them to hate his people, and to deal with his servants craftily.
Psalms	105	26	He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen,
Psalms	105	27	portents he wrought in Egypt, and signs in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	28	Darkness he sent, and it fell: yet they gave no heed to his word.
Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood, thus causing their fish to die.
Psalms	105	30	Their land was alive with frogs, swarming even in the royal chambers.
Psalms	105	31	At his command came flies, and lice in all their borders.
Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail for rain and fire that flashed through the land,
Psalms	105	33	smiting their vines and figs, breaking the trees of their border.
Psalms	105	34	At his command came locusts, young locusts beyond all counting,
Psalms	105	35	which ate every herb in the land, ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
Psalms	105	36	He struck down in their land all the firstborn, the firstlings of all their strength
Psalms	105	37	Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, and among his tribes no one was weary.
Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they left, for terror had fallen upon them.
Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud to screen them, and fire to give light in the night.
Psalms	105	40	He sent quails at their entreaty, and heavenly bread in abundance.
Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock; waters gushed: in the desert they ran like a river.
Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy promise to Abraham his servant.
Psalms	105	43	So he led out his people with joy, his elect with a ringing cry.
Psalms	105	44	And he gave them the lands of the nations, the fruit of their toil for possession,
Psalms	105	45	that so they might keep his statutes, and be of his laws observant. Hallelujah.
Psalms	106	1	Hallelujah!  Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness, for his kindness endures forever.
Psalms	106	2	Who can describe his heroic deeds, or publish all his praise?
Psalms	106	3	Happy they who act justly, and do righteousness evermore.
Psalms	106	4	Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people, and visit me with your gracious help.
Psalms	106	5	May I see the good fortune of your elect, may I share in the joy of your nation, and in the pride of your heritage.
Psalms	106	6	We, like our fathers, have sinned, we have done perversely and wickedly
Psalms	106	7	In the land of Egypt our fathers, all heedless of your wonders, and unmindful of your great kindness, at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
Psalms	106	8	But true to his name he saved them, in order to show his might.
Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; they marched through the depths as through desert,
Psalms	106	10	saved from the hand of the hostile, redeemed from the hand of the foe.
Psalms	106	11	The waters covered their enemies: not one of them was left.
Psalms	106	12	So then they believed in his words, and began to sing his praise.
Psalms	106	13	But soon they forgot his deeds: they did not wait for his counsel.
Psalms	106	14	Their greed was ravenous in the desert; they put God to the test in the wilderness.
Psalms	106	15	He gave them the thing they had asked for, but sent wasting disease among them.
Psalms	106	16	The camp grew jealous of Moses and of Aaron, holy one of the LORD .
Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered Abiram’s company.
Psalms	106	18	Fire broke out on their company, flame kindled upon the wicked.
Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed to the molten image.
Psalms	106	20	They exchanged their glorious God for the image of ox that eats grass.
Psalms	106	21	They forgot the God who had saved them by mighty deeds in Egypt
Psalms	106	22	Wonders in the land of Ham, terrors by the Red Sea.
Psalms	106	23	So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, but for Moses his elect, who stepped into the breach before him, to divert his deadly wrath.
Psalms	106	24	They spurned the delightsome land, they refused to believe in his word.
Psalms	106	25	They grumbled in their tents, would not listen to the voice of the LORD .
Psalms	106	26	So he swore with uplifted hand to lay them low in the wilderness;
Psalms	106	27	to disperse their seed among heathen, to scatter them over the world.
Psalms	106	28	Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, and ate what was offered the dead.
Psalms	106	29	They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, and plague broke out among them.
Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood between, and so the plague was stayed;
Psalms	106	31	and it was counted to him for righteousness unto all generations forever.
Psalms	106	32	They angered him at the waters of Meribah, through them it went ill with Moses.
Psalms	106	33	They rebelled against his spirit, and he uttered speech that was rash.
Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the nations, as the LORD  had commanded them;
Psalms	106	35	but they mingled with the heathen, and learned to do as they did.
Psalms	106	36	Their idol gods they worshipped, and they were ensnared by them.
Psalms	106	37	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.
Psalms	106	38	They poured out innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they offered to Canaan’s idols, and the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms	106	39	They became unclean by their works, and adulterous in their deeds.
Psalms	106	40	Then the LORD ’s fury was on his people, filled with horror at his inheritance.
Psalms	106	41	He delivered them to the heathen, to the sway of those who hated them.
Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.
Psalms	106	43	Many a time he saved them, but they rebelled at his counsel, and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
Psalms	106	44	Yet he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
Psalms	106	45	He remembered his covenant, and, in his great kindness, relented.
Psalms	106	46	He caused them to be pitied by all who carried them captive.
Psalms	106	47	Save us, O LORD  our God, and gather us out of the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, and to make our boast of your praise.
Psalms	106	48	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,* *from everlasting to everlasting.* *And let all the people say “Amen.”* *Praise the LORD .*
Psalms	107	1	Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness for his kindness endures forever.
Psalms	107	2	Let this be the song of the ransomed, whom the LORD  has redeemed from distress,
Psalms	107	3	gathering them from all lands, east, west, north, and south.
Psalms	107	4	In the wastes of the desert some wandered, finding no way to a city inhabited.
Psalms	107	5	Full of hunger and thirst, their spirit failed.
Psalms	107	6	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses,
Psalms	107	7	guiding them straight on the way, till they reached an inhabited city.
Psalms	107	8	Let them thank the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people;
Psalms	107	9	for the thirsty he satisfies, and the hungry he fills with good things.
Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness and gloom prisoners in irons and misery,
Psalms	107	11	for rebelling against God’s word, and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
Psalms	107	12	Their heart was bowed with toil; there was no one to help when they stumbled.
Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
Psalms	107	14	Out of darkness and gloom he brought them, and burst their chains.
Psalms	107	15	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
Psalms	107	16	For he shattered the gates of bronze, and broke bars of iron.
Psalms	107	17	Some were sick from their wicked ways, and suffering because of their sins.
Psalms	107	18	All manner of food they hated; they had come to the gates of death.
Psalms	107	19	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
Psalms	107	20	He sent his word and healed them, and delivered their life from the pit.
Psalms	107	21	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
Psalms	107	22	Let them offer to him thankofferings, and with joy tell what things he has done.
Psalms	107	23	Some crossed the sea in ships, doing business in great waters.
Psalms	107	24	They have seen what the LORD  can do, and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
Psalms	107	25	At his command rose a tempest, which lifted the waves on high.
Psalms	107	26	Up to heaven they went, down to the depths; their courage failed them.
Psalms	107	27	They staggered and reeled like drunkards; all their skills useless.
Psalms	107	28	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.
Psalms	107	29	He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
Psalms	107	30	They were glad, because it was quiet; they were led to the haven they longed for.
Psalms	107	31	Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.
Psalms	107	32	Where the people assemble, extol him, and praise him in council of elders.
Psalms	107	33	He turns streams into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty land,
Psalms	107	34	fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the sin of the people.
Psalms	107	35	A desert he makes pools of water, a land of drought into springs of water.
Psalms	107	36	He settles the hungry therein, they establish a city to live in.
Psalms	107	37	They sow fields and plant vineyards, which furnish a fruitful yield.
Psalms	107	38	By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he lets not their cattle decrease.
Psalms	107	39	Yet when they are bowed and diminished by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
Psalms	107	40	he pours contempt upon princes, and on trackless wastes leads them astray
Psalms	107	41	He lifts the poor out of misery, and makes families fruitful as flocks.
Psalms	107	42	At this sight shall the upright be glad, and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
Psalms	107	43	Let those who are wise observe this, and consider the love of the LORD
Psalms	108	1	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music; awake, my soul.

Psalms	109	15	on record always before the LORD, and his memory root from the earth;
Psalms	109	16	for he gave no thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and the needy, drove the downhearted to death.
Psalms	109	17	“May the curses he loved light upon him, may the blessings he loathed be afar.
Psalms	109	18	Like a garment he clothed him with curses; may they pierce to his inwards like water, and cling to his bones like oil.
Psalms	109	19	Let them be like the robe he wraps round him, like the belt he wears every day.”
Psalms	109	20	Be this the reward of my adversaries, of those who speak evil against me.
Psalms	109	21	But you, LORD  my GOD , be true to your name, deal kindly with me; in your gracious kindness save me.
Psalms	109	22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Psalms	109	23	I am gone like a lengthening shadow, I am shaken off like a locust.
Psalms	109	24	My knees totter from fasting, my flesh is shrivelled and spare.

Psalms	109	27	Teach them that this is your hand, and your own doing, O LORD .
