That is, first begotten; as the Evangelist declares, the only begotten of his Father: hence, St. Chrisostom explains firstborn, not first created, as he was not created at all, but born of his Father before all ages; that is, coeval with the Father and with the Holy Ghost.	1	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths, In meat, etc....

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ.	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	18	Let no man seduce you, willing in humility and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh: Willing, etc.... That is, by a self willed, self invented, superstitious worship, falsely pretending humility, but really proceeding from pride. Such was the worship, that many of the philosophers (against whom St. Paul speaks, ver. 8) paid to angels or demons, by sacrificing to them, as carriers of intelligence betwixt God and men; pretending humility in so doing, as if God was too great to be addressed by men; and setting aside the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, who is the head both of angels and men. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics, disciples of Simon and Menander, to the angels, whom they believed to be makers and lords of this lower world. This is certain, that they whom the apostle here condemns, did not hold the head, (ver. 19,) that is, Jesus Christ, and his mediatorship; and therefore what he writes here no way touches the Catholic doctrine and practice, of desiring our good angels to pray to God for us, through Jesus Christ. St. Jerome [Epist. ad Algas.] understands by the religion or service of angels, the Jewish teachers, who sought to subject the new Christians to the observance of the Mosaic law.	1	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	20	If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	21	Touch not: taste not: handle not. Touch not, etc.... The meaning is, that Christians should not subject themselves, either to the ordinances of the old law, forbidding touching or tasting things unclean; or to the superstitious invention of heretics, imposing such restraints, under pretence of wisdom, humility, or mortification.	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	22	Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh. Colossians Chapter 3 He exhorts them to put off the old man, and to put on the new. The duties of wives and husbands, children and servants.	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	1	Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.	1	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	2	Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.	1	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	13	Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.	1	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans. And that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.... What this epistle was is uncertain, and annotators have given different opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an epistle which St. Paul wrote to the Laodiceans, and is since lost, for that now extant is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of St. Paul; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that epistle. Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St. Paul by the Laodiceans, which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them. However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable that St. Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans, about the same time that he wrote to the Colossians, as he had them both equally at heart, and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the Colossians for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate to each other what they had received from him; as one epistle might contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers, against which the apostle was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their pernicious doctrine.	1	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians	1	4	As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.	2	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors: Gave some apostles—Until we all meet, etc....

The Book of Esther	1	1	In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	2	When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	3	Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	4	That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	5	And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	6	And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	7	And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king’s magnificence.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	8	Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	9	Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	10	Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	11	To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	12	But she refused, and would not come at the king’s commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	13	Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	14	(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	15	What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	16	And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	18	And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king’s indignation is just.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	19	If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	20	And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	21	His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	1	22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people. Esther Chapter 2 Esther is advanced to be queen. Mardochai detecteth a plot against the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	1	After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	2	And the king’s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	3	And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king’s women: and let them receive women’s ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	4	And whosoever among them all shall please the king’s eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	5	There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	7	And he had brought up his brother’s daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	8	And when the king’s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	9	And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women’s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king’s house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	10	And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	11	And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Esther’s welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	12	Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	13	And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king’s chamber.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	14	And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king’s concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	15	And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	16	So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	18	And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king’s gate,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	20	Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	21	At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king’s gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	22	And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai’s name, who had reported the thing unto her.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	2	23	It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king. Esther Chapter 3 Aman, advanced by the king, is offended at Mardochai, and therefore procureth the king’s decree to destroy the whole nation of the Jews.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	1	After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	2	And all the king’s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	3	And the king’s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king’s commandment?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	4	And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	5	Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	6	And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	7	In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	8	And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	9	If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	10	And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	11	And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	12	And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	13	Were sent by the king’s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	14	And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	3	15	The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king’s commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping. Esther Chapter 4 Mardochai desireth Esther to petition the king for the Jews. They join in fasting and prayer.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	1	Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	2	And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king’s court.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	3	And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king’s cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	4	Then Esther’s maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	5	And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	6	And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	7	And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king’s treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	8	He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	9	And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	10	She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	11	All the king’s servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king’s inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	12	And when Mardochai had heard this,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	13	He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king’s house, more than all the Jews:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	14	For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father’s house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	15	And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	16	Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	4	17	So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him. Esther Chapter 5 Esther is graciously received: she inviteth the king and Aman to dinner, Aman prepareth a gibbet for Mardochai.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	1	And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	2	And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	3	And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	4	But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	5	And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther’s will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	6	And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	7	And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	8	If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	9	So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	10	But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	11	And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	12	And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	13	And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king’s gate.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	5	14	Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared. Esther Chapter 6 The king hearing of the good service done him by Mardochai, commandeth Aman to honour him next to the king, which he performeth.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	1	That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	2	They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	3	And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all. No reward at all.... He received some presents from the king, chap. 12.5; but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers, that they esteemed them as nothing at all.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	4	And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king’s house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	5	The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	6	And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	7	Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	8	Ought to be clothed with the king’s apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	9	And let the first of the king’s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	10	And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	11	So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	12	But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	13	And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	6	14	As they were yet speaking, the king’s eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared. Esther Chapter 7 Esther’s petition for herself and her people: Aman is hanged upon the gibbet he had prepared for Mardochai.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	1	So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	2	And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	3	Then she answered: If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	4	For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	5	And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	6	And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	7	But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	8	And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king’s mouth, and immediately they covered his face.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	9	And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman’s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	7	10	So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king’s wrath ceased. Esther Chapter 8 Mardochai is advanced: Aman’s letters are reversed.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	1	On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	2	And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	3	And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	4	But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	5	And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king’s provinces, may be reversed by new letters.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	6	For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	7	And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman’s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	8	Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king’s name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king’s name, and were sealed with his ring.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	9	Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	10	And these letters which were sent in the king’s name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	11	And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	12	And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	13	And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	14	So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king’s edict was hung up in Susan.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	15	And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king’s presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced, and was glad.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	16	But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	8	17	And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: Insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all. Esther Chapter 9 The Jews kill their enemies that would have killed them. The days of Phurim are appointed to be kept holy.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	1	So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries. To revenge, etc.... The Jews on this occasion, by authority from the king, were made executioners of the public justice, for punishing by death a crime worthy of death, viz., a malicious conspiracy for extirpating their whole nation.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	2	And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	3	And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	4	For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men’s mouths.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	5	So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	6	Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	7	Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	8	And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	9	And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	10	And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	11	And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	12	And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	13	And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	14	And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	15	And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	16	Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king’s dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	17	Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	18	But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	19	But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	20	And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king’s provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	21	That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	22	Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	24	For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	25	And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king’s letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	26	And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	27	And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	28	These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	29	And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	30	And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	31	And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	9	32	And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther. Esther Chapter 10 Assuerus’s greatness. Mardochai’s dignity.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	10	1	And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	10	2	And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	10	3	And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	10	4	Then Mardochai said: God hath done these things. Then Mardochai, etc....

The Book of Esther	10	10	And he commanded that there should be two lots, one of the people of God, and the other of all the nations.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	10	11	And both lots came to the day appointed already from that time before God to all nations:	3	DRB

The Book of Esther	12	3	Then the king had them both examined, and after they had confessed, commanded them to be put to death.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	12	4	But the king made a record of what was done: and Mardochai also committed the memory of the thing to writing.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	12	5	And the king commanded him, to abide in the court of the palace, and gave him presents for the information.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	12	6	But Aman the son of Amadathi the Bugite was in great honour with the king, and sought to hurt Mardochai and his people, because of the two eunuchs of the king who were put to death. Esther Chapter 13 A copy of a letter sent by Aman to destroy the Jews. Mardochai’s prayer for the people.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	1	And this was the copy of the letter: Artaxerxes the great king who reigneth from India to Ethiopia, to the princes and governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, that are subject to his empire, greeting.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	2	Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly without any terror, and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all men,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	3	But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by name,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	4	Told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, despised the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	5	Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all mankind using perverse laws, and going against our commandments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	6	We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	7	That these wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	8	But Mardochai besought the Lord, remembering all his works,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	9	And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	10	Thou hast made heaven and earth and all things that are under the cope of heaven.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	11	Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	12	Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	13	(For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,)	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	14	But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	15	And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, because our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	16	Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	17	Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, O Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	13	18	And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads. Esther Chapter 14 The prayer of Esther for herself and her people.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	1	Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	2	And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	3	And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying: O my Lord, who alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	4	My danger is in my hands.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	5	I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	6	We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	7	For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	8	And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	9	They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	10	That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	11	Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	12	Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	13	Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	14	But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	15	And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	16	Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my pride and glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	17	And that I have not eaten at Aman’s table, nor hath the king’s banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink offerings:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	18	And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	14	19	O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear. Esther Chapter 15 Esther comes into the king’s presence: she is terrified, but God turns his heart.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	1	And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	2	Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	3	And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	4	And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her glorious apparel.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	5	And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	6	And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	7	And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the ground.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	8	But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	9	So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	10	And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	11	And God changed the king’s spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	12	What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	13	Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	14	Come near then, and touch the sceptre.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	15	And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	16	She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	17	For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	18	And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	15	19	But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. Esther Chapter 16 A copy of the king’s letter in favour of the Jews.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	1	The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting. From India to Ethiopia.... That is, who reigneth from India to Ethiopia.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	2	Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	3	And not only endeavour to oppress the king’s subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	4	Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	5	And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all men’s praise,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	6	While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	7	Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	8	Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	9	Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	10	Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	11	And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	12	But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	13	For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	14	Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	15	But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	16	And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	17	Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	18	For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	19	But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	20	And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	21	For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	22	Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	23	That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.	3	DRB
The Book of Esther	16	24	And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.	3	DRB

The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	4	I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	5	That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance and in all knowledge;	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	6	As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	7	So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	8	Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you: but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	14	I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	19	For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	21	For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	22	For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	24	But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men. The foolishness, etc.... That is to say, what appears foolish to the world in the ways of God, is indeed most wise; and what appears weak is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	26	For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	27	But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	28	And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his sight.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	30	But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	31	That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 2 His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	2	For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	5	That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	9	But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	10	But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	12	Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	14	But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined. The sensual man—the spiritual man.... The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. 1 Corinthians Chapter 3 They must not contend about their teachers, who are but God’s ministers and accountable to him. Their works shall be tried by fire.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	3	For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith: I indeed am of Paul: and another: I am of Apollo: are you not men? What then is Apollo and what is Paul?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	5	The ministers of him whom you have believed: and to every one as the Lord hath given.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	6	I have planted, Apollo watered: but God gave the increase.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	7	Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	9	For we are God’s coadjutors. You are God’s husbandry: you are God’s building.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	12	Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble: Upon this foundation.... The foundation is Christ and his doctrine: or the true faith in him, working through charity. The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser sins. Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial, (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest of what sort every man’s work has been: of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of God’s judgment shall try every man’s work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	13	Every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	14	If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	15	If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	16	Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	17	But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	20	And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	21	Let no man therefore glory in men.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	22	For all things are yours, whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	23	And you are Christ’s. And Christ is God’s. 1 Corinthians Chapter 4 God’s ministers are not to be judged. He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	1	Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	2	Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man’s day. But neither do I judge my own self.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	4	For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	5	Therefore, judge not before the time: until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise from God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	6	But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	7	For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	8	You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honourable, but we without honour.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	12	And we labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled: and we bless. We are persecuted: and we suffer it.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	13	We are blasphemed: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest children.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	15	For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus: as I teach every where in every church.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	18	As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	21	What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit of meekness? 1 Corinthians Chapter 5 He excommunicates the incestuous adulterer and admonishes them to purge out the old leaven.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	1	It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father’s wife.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	2	And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	3	I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	8	Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	10	I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this world.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	13	For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves. 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 He blames them for going to law before unbelievers. Of sins that exclude from the kingdom of heaven. The evil of fornication.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	2	Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	3	Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	4	If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother: and that before unbelievers.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	7	Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? A fault.... Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	8	But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	9	Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	10	Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	11	And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any. All things are lawful, etc.... That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	13	Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	14	Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	15	Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	16	Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	18	Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	19	Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God: and you are not your own?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	20	For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. 1 Corinthians Chapter 7 Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy. Virginity is preferable to a married state.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	2	But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband. Have his own wife.... That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are. (Ver. 7:8.) But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	5	Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment. By indulgence.... That is, by a condescension to your weakness.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt. If they do not contain, etc.... This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by vow, have given their first faith to God; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, if they cannot contain.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	10	But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	11	And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	12	For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away. I speak, not the Lord.... Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	13	And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy. Is sanctified.... The meaning is not, that the faith of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation; but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	16	For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	17	But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	21	Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	23	You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	25	Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	26	I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	28	But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	29	This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	33	But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	34	And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry. Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc.... The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will and not sin, provided they afterwards marry; but that the father, with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no sin to him if she marry.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	37	For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	38	Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	39	A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	40	But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God. 1 Corinthians Chapter 8 Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth. Knowledge puffeth up, etc.... Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known by him.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	4	But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	5	For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many): Gods many, etc.... Reputed for such among the heathens.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	6	Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	7	But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	8	But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	10	For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	12	Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother. If meat scandalize.... That is, if my eating cause my brother to sin. 1 Corinthians Chapter 9 The apostle did not make use of his power of being maintained at the charges of those to whom he preached, that he might give no hindrance to the gospel. Of running in the race and striving for the mastery.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	1	Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	2	And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	3	My defence with them that do examine me is this.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	4	Have not we power to eat and to drink?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister as well as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? A woman, a sister.... Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	7	Who serveth as a soldier, at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	8	Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say; these things?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	10	Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	13	Know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar partake with the altar?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	14	So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die rather than that any man should make my glory void.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me: for a necessity lieth upon me. For woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel. It is no glory.... That is, I have nothing to glory of.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	19	For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	20	And I became to the Jews a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	21	To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	23	And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be made partaker thereof.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	24	Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	25	And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things. And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible one.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	27	But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway. I chastise, etc.... Here St. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires. 1 Corinthians Chapter 10 By the example of the Israelites, he shews that we are not to build too much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the service of idols and from things offered to idols.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	1	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud: and all passed through the sea.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	2	And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea: In Moses.... Under the conduct of Moses, they received baptism in figure, by passing under the cloud, and through the sea; and they partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure, by eating of the manna, (called here a spiritual food because it was a figure of the true bread which comes down from heaven,) and drinking the water, miraculously brought out of the rock, called here a spiritual rock, because it was also a figure of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual food:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	4	And all drank the same spiritual drink: (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.)	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	5	But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things, as they also coveted.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	7	Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication: and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	10	Neither do you murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. The ends of the world.... That is, the last ages.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore, he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	13	Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. Or.... no temptation hath taken hold of you.... or come upon you as yet, but what is human, or incident to man. Issue.... or a way to escape.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	16	The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? Which we bless.... Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, ver. 21, that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils by eating of the meats sacrificed to them.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	17	For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread. One bread.... or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread. For it is by our communicating with Christ, and with one another, in this blessed sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel according to the flesh. Are not they that eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	19	What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? Or that the idol is any thing?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	20	But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	21	You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me: but all things are not expedient.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me: but all things do not edify.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but that which is another’s.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat: asking no question for conscience’ sake.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	26	The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you be willing to go: eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols: do not eat of it, for his sake that told it and for conscience’ sake.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	29	Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	31	Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	32	Be without offence to the Jew, and to the Gentiles and to the church of God:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	33	As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself but to many: that they may be saved. 1 Corinthians Chapter 11 Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	1	Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	7	The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	9	For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	10	Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels. A power.... that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	11	But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	13	You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	17	Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	18	For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you. There must be also heresies.... By reason of the pride and perversity of man’s heart; not by God’s will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	20	When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper. The Lord’s supper.... So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	21	For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	22	What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	24	And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	27	Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. Or drink.... Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink. Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc.... This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord’s body.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	28	But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. Drink of the chalice.... This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	30	Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	31	But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	32	But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	34	If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. 1 Corinthians Chapter 12 Of the diversity of spiritual gifts. The members of the mystical body, like those of the natural body, must mutually cherish one another.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	5	And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	7	And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	8	To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	9	To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of speeches.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	11	But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	14	For the body also is not one member, but many.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	18	But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	19	And if they all were one member, where would be the body?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	22	Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are more necessary.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	23	And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	24	But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	25	That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually careful one for another.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	28	And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	30	Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	31	But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way. 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	2	And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	3	And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	4	Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	5	Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	8	Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	12	We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	13	And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity. 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 The gift of prophesying is to be preferred before that of speaking strange tongues.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	1	Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy. Prophesy.... That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries. Not unto men.... Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	5	And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	10	There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	11	If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	12	So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church. Of spirits.... Of spiritual gifts.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	13	And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without fruit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	16	Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou sayest. Amen.... The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	17	For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	19	But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and in sense be perfect.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	26	How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	27	If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	29	And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	30	But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	31	For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	34	Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	35	But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	37	If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	38	But if any man know not, he shall not be known.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with tongues.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	40	But let all things be done decently and according to order. 1 Corinthians Chapter 15 Christ’s resurrection and ours. The manner of our resurrection.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	1	Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	2	By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried: and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	6	Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	7	After that, he was seen by James: then by all the apostles.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	8	And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me hath not been void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	11	For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have believed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith is also vain.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain: for you are yet in your sins.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	18	Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	21	For by a man came death: and by a man the resurrection of the dead.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	22	And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	23	But every one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ: then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	24	Afterwards the end: when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father: when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	26	And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	27	All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. The Son also himself shall be subject unto him.... That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise, what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then baptized for them? That are baptized for the dead.... Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	30	Why also are we in danger every hour?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	31	I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	32	If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Let us eat and drink, etc.... That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	33	Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	34	Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak it to your shame.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? Or with what manner of body shall they come?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	36	Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be: but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	40	And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	41	One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption: it shall rise in incorruption.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness: it shall rise in power.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	45	The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	46	Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	47	The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	48	Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	49	Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible. And we shall be changed.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	54	And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	55	O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	56	Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 16 Of collection of alms. Admonitions and salutations.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints: as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him: that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	3	And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	6	And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way: for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus, until Pentecost.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct ye him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I look for him with the brethren.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	12	And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye: stand fast in the faith: do manfully and be strengthened.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done in charity.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	15	And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	16	That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	17	And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha. Let him be anathema, maranatha.... Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, ‘The Lord is come’ already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha: ‘May our Lord come’, that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	24	My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.	4	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the word of life.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and hath appeared to us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy may be full.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and declare unto you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his word is not in us. 1 John Chapter 2 Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love one another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but abide by the spirit of God in the church.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	1	My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	3	And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. We have known him, if we keep his commandments.... He speaks of that practical knowledge by love and affection, which can only be proved by our keeping his commandments; and without which we can not be said to know God as we should do.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	4	He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar: and the truth is not in him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	5	But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected. And by this we know that we are in him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	7	Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	8	Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both in him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth. A new commandment.... Viz., the commandment of love, which was first given in the old law; but was renewed and extended by Christ. See John 13.34.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no scandal in him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	13	I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	14	I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	15	Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	16	For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	17	And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	18	Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. It is the last hour.... That is, it is the last age of the world. Many Antichrists; ... that is, many heretics, enemies of Christ and his church, and forerunners of the great Antichrist.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	19	They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. They were not of us.... That is, they were not solid, steadfast, genuine Christians: otherwise they would have remained in the church.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	20	But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things. The unction from the Holy One.... That is, grace and wisdom from the Holy Ghost. Know all things.... The true children of God’s church, remaining in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the grace of the Holy Ghost, promised to the church and her pastors; and have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction; so as to have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that society of which they are members.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	21	I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	22	Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	24	As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	25	And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	26	These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	27	And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. You have no need, etc.... You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost; which these new teachers have no share in.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	28	And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	29	If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth justice is born of him. 1 John Chapter 3 Of the love of God to us. How we may distinguish the children of God and those of the devil. Of loving one another and of purity of conscience.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	1	Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	2	Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	3	And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is iniquity. Iniquity.... transgression of the law.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	5	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him there is no sin.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath not seen him nor known him. Sinneth not.... viz., mortally. See chap. 1.8.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	9	Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God. Committeth not sin.... That is, as long as he keepeth in himself this seed of grace, and this divine generation, by which he is born of God. But then he may fall from this happy state, by the abuse of his free will, as appears from Rom. 11.20-22; Cor. 9.27; and 10.12; Phil. 2.12; Apoc. 3.11.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	11	For this is the declaration which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother’s just.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	13	Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	16	In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	17	He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	19	In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall persuade our hearts.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	20	For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	21	Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	22	And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	23	And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us. 1 John Chapter 4 What spirits are of God, and what are not. We must love one another, because God has loved us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	1	Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Try the spirits.... Viz., by examining whether their teaching be agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) He that knoweth God, heareth us [the pastors of the church]. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	2	By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: Every spirit which confesseth, etc.... Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient; but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	3	And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world. That dissolveth Jesus.... Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his divinity. He is now already in the world.... Not in his person, but in his spirit, and in his precursors.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	5	They are of the world. Therefore of the world they speak: and the world heareth them.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	6	We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	7	Dearly beloved, let us love one another: for charity is of God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God: for God is charity.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	9	By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	10	In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	11	My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	13	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	16	And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	17	In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	18	Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth is not perfected in charity. Fear is not in charity, etc.... Perfect charity, or love, banisheth human fear, that is, the fear of men; as also all perplexing fear, which makes men mistrust or despair of God’s mercy; and that kind of servile fear, which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of God’s judgments, so often recomended in holy writ; nor that fear and trembling, with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2.12.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	19	Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	20	If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	21	And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother. 1 John Chapter 5 Of them that are born of God, and of true charity. Faith overcomes the world. Three that bear witness to Christ. Of faith in his name and of sin that is and is not to death.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. Is born of God.... That is, is justified, and become a child of God by baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere disposition to keep God’s holy law and commandments.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	2	In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	3	For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not heavy.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory which overcometh the world: Our faith. Our faith.... Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a faith that worketh by charity. Gal. 5.6	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ is the truth. Came by water and blood.... Not only to wash away our sins by the water of baptism, but by his own blood.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	7	And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	8	And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three are one. The spirit, and the water, and the blood.... As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ’s divinity; so the spirit, which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his humanity, and are one; that is, all agree in one testimony.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. He that believeth not the Son, etc.... By refusing to believe the testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal life is obtained and promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this lively confidence, that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in the manner we ought. And this we know, and have experience of, by having obtained the petitions that we have made.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	11	And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not life.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	13	These things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life: you who believe in the name of the Son of God.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	14	And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	15	And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	16	He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death. For that I say not that any man ask. A sin which is not to death, etc.... It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin which is not to death, and a sin which is unto death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that is not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is unto death, and adds these words, for that I say not that any man ask, it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any man ask the remission: that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures, that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men’s sins be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault. A sin unto death.... Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	17	All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	19	We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in wickedness. And the whole world is seated in wickedness.... That is, a great part of the world. It may also signify, is under the wicked one, meaning the devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all the wicked. John 12.31.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. And may be in his true Son. He is, or this is the true God, and life eternal.... Which words are a clear proof of Christ’s divinity, and as such made use of by the ancient fathers.	5	DRB
The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. Keep yourselves from idols.... An admonition to the newly converted Christians, lest conversing with heathens and idolaters, they might fall back into the sin of idolatry, which may be the sin unto death here mentioned by St. John.	5	DRB

As much as to say, that baptism has not its efficacy, in order to salvation, from its washing away any bodily filth or dirt; but from its purging the conscience from sin, when accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party, to answer the interrogations made at that time, with relation to faith, the renouncing of Satan with all his works; and the obedience to God’s commandments.	6	DRB

The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	17	For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if at first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	18	And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Scarcely.... That is, not without much labour and difficulty; and because of the dangers which constantly surround, the temptations of the world, of the devil, and of our own corrupt nature.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	19	Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator. 1 Peter Chapter 5 He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and recommends to all humility and watchfulness.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	1	The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre’s sake but voluntarily:	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	3	Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	4	And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	5	In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	6	Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	7	Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	8	Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	9	Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls, your brethren who are in the world.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you and confirm you and establish you.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	11	To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	12	By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	13	The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you. And so doth my son, Mark.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	14	Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.	6	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians: in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all: making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	3	Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity: and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	6	And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	7	So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	8	For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2 The sincerity of the apostle’s preaching the gospel to them and of their receiving it.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	1	For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	2	But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	5	For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	6	Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	7	Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	8	So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame we have been to you that have believed:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	11	As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	12	We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	13	Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	16	Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end. To fill up their sins.... That is, to fill up the measure of their sins, after which God’s justice would punish them. For the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.... That is, to continue on them to the end.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	18	For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and joy. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3 The apostle’s concern and love for the Thessalonians.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	1	For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	2	And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	4	For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	8	Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	13	To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity. He treats of the resurrection of the dead.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	1	For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus that, as you have received from us, how you ought to walk and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should abstain from fornication:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour,	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	6	And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before and have testified.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	10	For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	11	And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your own business and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any man’s.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	12	And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	13	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	14	For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	15	For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ shall rise first.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	16	Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air: and so shall we be always with the Lord.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	17	Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5 The day of the Lord shall come when least expected. Exhortations to several duties.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	1	But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you:	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	5	For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we are not of the night nor of darkness.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be sober.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast plate of faith and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	11	For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you also do.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you;	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	13	That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have peace with them.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	14	And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the feeble minded: support the weak: be patient towards all men. The unquiet.... That is, such as are irregular and disorderly.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil to any man: but ever follow that which is good towards each other and towards all men.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	16	Always rejoice.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	18	In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	19	Extinguish not the spirit.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophecies.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	21	But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	22	From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	23	And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things: that your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	24	He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	26	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.	7	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	3	As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	4	Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which furnish questions rather than the edification of God which is in faith.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	6	From which things some, going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law: understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	9	Knowing this: That the law is not made for the just man but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, The law is not.... He means, that the just man doth good, and avoideth evil, not as compelled by the law, and merely for fear of the punishment appointed for transgressors; but voluntarily, and out of the love of God and virtue; and would do so, though there were no law.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	10	For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	11	Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God which hath been committed to my trust.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	12	I give him thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	13	Who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	14	Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	15	A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	16	But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	17	Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	18	This precept, I commend to thee, O son Timothy: according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	19	Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 1 Timothy Chapter 2 Prayers are to be said for all men, because God wills the salvation of all. Women are not to teach.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	1	I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	2	For kings and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	5	For there is one God: and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: One mediator.... Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times. A redemption for all.... He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle (I say the truth, I lie not), a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	9	In like manner, women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	10	But, as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence. 2:13.For Adam was first formed; then Eve.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not seduced; but the woman, being seduced, was in the transgression.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	15	Yet she shall be saved through child bearing; if she continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety. 1 Timothy Chapter 3 What sort of men are to be admitted into the clergy. The church is the pillar of truth.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	1	A faithful saying: If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	2	It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher, Of one wife.... The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife (for St. Paul himself had none), but that no one should be admitted to the holy orders of bishop, priest, or deacon, who had been married more than once.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	5	But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	6	Not a neophyte: lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil. A neophyte.... That is, one lately baptized, a young convert.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	7	Moreover, he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	8	Deacons in like manner: chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	11	The women in like manner: chaste, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in all things.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children and their own houses.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	13	For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a good degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	14	These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee shortly.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. The pillar and ground of the truth.... Therefore the church of the living God can never uphold error, nor bring in corruptions, superstition, or idolatry.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	16	And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory. 1 Timothy Chapter 4 He warns him against heretics, and exhorts him to the exercise of piety.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	1	Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have known the truth. Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats.... He speaks of the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all kind of meat; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage, holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow have chosen the better part: and prohibits not the use of any meats whatsoever in proper times and seasons; though she does not judge all kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	6	These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	7	But avoid foolish and old wives fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	9	A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	10	For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	13	Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	16	Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee. 1 Timothy Chapter 5 He gives him lessons concerning widows, and how he is to behave to his clergy.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	1	An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	2	Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her parents; for this is acceptable before God.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	5	But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	6	For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	7	And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	8	But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	10	Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	12	Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith. Their first faith.... Their vow, by which they had engaged themselves to Christ.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	13	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	14	I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	16	If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	17	Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	19	Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	20	Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	21	I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	22	Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	23	Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent infirmities.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	24	Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	25	In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. 1 Timothy Chapter 6 Duties of servants. The danger of covetousness. Lessons for the rich.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	1	Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be blasphemed.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	2	But they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	5	Conflicts of men corrupted in mind and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	8	But having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	9	For they that will become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	10	For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	11	But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	13	I charge thee before God who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	14	That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings and Lord of lords:	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality and inhabiteth light inaccessible: whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting. Amen.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	17	Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy)	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	18	To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to others,	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	19	To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called.	8	DRB
The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	21	Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.	8	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	5	To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	6	I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	7	Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	9	As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	11	For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	14	And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	17	Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	18	Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I tarried with him fifteen days.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	21	Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth now preach the faith which once he impugned.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me. Galatians Chapter 2 The apostle’s preaching was approved of by the other apostles. The Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	1	Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	2	And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles: but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	4	But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	5	To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	6	But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man): for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision. The gospel of the uncircumcision.... The preaching of the gospel to the uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles. St. Paul was called in an extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles; St. Peter, besides his general commission over the whole flock, (John 21. 15, etc.,) had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumcision, that is, of the Jews.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	8	(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	9	And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	10	Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. I withstood, etc.... The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul’s reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	12	For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	13	And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented: so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	15	We by nature are Jews: and not of the Gentiles, sinners.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	16	But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid!	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	19	For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God; with Christ I am nailed to the cross.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	20	And I live, now not I: but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself for me.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	21	I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain. Galatians Chapter 3 The Spirit, and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law, but by faith.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	1	O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	5	He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of the faith?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	6	As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	7	Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	9	Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	11	But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	12	But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall live in them.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree).	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	15	Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	16	To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	17	Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	19	Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Because of transgressions.... To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats. Ordained by angels.... The law was delivered by angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the mediator, on this occasion, between God and the people.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	21	Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe. Hath concluded all under sin.... that is, hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	23	But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be justified by faith. Pedagogue.... That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	25	But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	26	For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. Neither Jew, etc.... That is, no distinction of Jew, etc.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	29	And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. Galatians Chapter 4 Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn sons of Abraham.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. Under the elements, etc.... That is, under the first rudiments of religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and sacraments.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	5	That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	7	Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	8	But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature, are not gods.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	9	But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to serve again?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	10	You observe days and months and times, and years. You observe days, etc.... He speaks not of the observation of the Lord’s day, or other Christian festivals; but either of the superstitious observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the Jewish festivals, to the observance of which, certain Jewish teachers sought to induce the Galatians.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	12	Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You have not injured me at all.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	13	And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	14	You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	15	Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	16	Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	17	They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	18	But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	20	And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	24	Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is Agar.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	25	For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	26	But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	27	For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit: so also it is now.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	30	But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. Galatians Chapter 5 He exhorts them to stand to their Christian liberty. Of the fruits of the flesh and of the spirit.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	1	Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	2	Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	4	You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	5	For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by Charity.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	7	You did run well. What hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	9	A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	13	For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty. Only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh: but by charity of the spirit serve one another.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another: take heed you be not consumed one of another.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	16	I say then: Walk in the spirit: and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh: For these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	21	Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	23	Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	26	Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. Galatians Chapter 6 He exhorts to charity, humility and all virtue. He glories in nothing but in the cross of Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	1	Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another’s burdens: and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	3	For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	4	But let every one prove his own work: and so he shall have glory in himself only and not in another.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	5	For every one shall bear his own burden.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	6	And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived: God is not mocked.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	8	For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	9	And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	10	Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	11	See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	12	For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law: but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but a new creature.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	16	And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them and mercy: and upon the Israel of God.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.	9	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	1	God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	2	In these days, hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high: The figure ... that is, the express image, and most perfect resemblance. Making purgation.... That is, having purged away our sins by his passion.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	7	And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	8	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	10	And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish: but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. But thou art the selfsame: and thy years shall not fail.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation? Hebrews Chapter 2 The transgression of the precepts of the Son of God is far more condemnable than of those of the Old Testament given by angels.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	1	Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	5	For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	7	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy hands.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he might taste death for all.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	10	For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion. Perfect by his passion.... By suffering, Christ was to enter into his glory, Luke 24.26, which the apostle here calls being made perfect.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	12	I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	13	And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	14	Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	15	And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	16	For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold. No where doth he, etc.... That is, he never took upon him the nature of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	18	For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he is able to succour them also that are tempted. Hebrews Chapter 3 Christ is more excellent than Moses. Wherefore we must adhere to him by faith and obedience.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	2	Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	6	But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the desert,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	10	Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	11	As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	12	Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	15	While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	16	For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	19	And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief. Hebrews Chapter 4 The Christian’s rest. We are to enter into it through Jesus Christ.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore lest, the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	2	For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	3	For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	4	For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	6	Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	7	Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David; To day, after so long a time as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards spoken of another day. Jesus.... Josue, who in Greek is called Jesus.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	11	Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	14	Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	15	For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	16	Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid. Hebrews Chapter 5 The office of a high priest. Christ is our high priest.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	3	And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	4	Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	5	So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	8	And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	9	And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	10	Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	12	For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	13	For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil. Hebrews Chapter 6 He warns them of the danger of falling by apostasy and exhorts them to patience and perseverance.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	1	Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect: not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works and of faith towards God, The word of the beginning.... The first rudiments of the Christian doctrine.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, It is impossible, etc.... The meaning is, that it is impossible for such as have fallen after baptism, to be again baptized; and very hard for such as have apostatized from the faith, after having received many graces, to return again to the happy state from which they fell.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	5	Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	6	And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	7	For the earth, that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	8	But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and very near unto a curse: whose end is to be burnt.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	9	But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered and do minister to the saints.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	12	That you become not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	13	For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	14	Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I shall multiply thee.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	15	And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, we who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	19	Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	20	Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. Hebrews Chapter 7 The priesthood of Christ according to the order of Melchisedech excels the Levitical priesthood and puts an end both to that and to the law.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever. Without father, etc.... Not that he had no father, etc., but that neither his father, nor his pedigree, nor his birth, nor his death, are set down in scripture.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	5	And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	6	But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the better.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	8	And here indeed, men that die receive tithes: but there, he hath witness that he liveth.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	9	And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedech met him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	11	If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech: and not be called according to the order of Aaron?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	16	Who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	18	There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	19	For the law brought nothing to perfection: but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it is not without an oath (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	21	But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever).	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	23	And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue: Many priests, etc.... The apostle notes this difference between the high priests of the law, and our high priest Jesus Christ; that they being removed by death, made way for their successors; whereas our Lord Jesus is a priest for ever, and hath no successor; but liveth and concurreth for ever with his ministers, the priests of the new testament, in all their functions. Also, that no one priest of the law, nor all of them together, could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting redemption, which our one high priest Jesus Christ has offered once, and for ever.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	24	But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	25	Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us. Make intercession.... Christ, as man, continually maketh intercession for us, by representing his passion to his Father.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath (which was since the law) the Son who is perfected for evermore. Hebrews Chapter 8 More of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ and of the New Testament.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. The holies.... That is, the sanctuary.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	4	If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law. If then he were on earth, etc.... That is, if he were not of a higher condition than the Levitical order of earthly priests, and had not another kind of sacrifice to offer, he should be excluded by them from the priesthood, and its functions, which by the law were appropriated to their tribe.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount. Who serve unto, etc.... The priesthood of the law and its functions were a kind of an example and shadow of what is done by Christ in his church militant and triumphant, of which the tabernacle was a pattern.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	6	But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament which is established on better promises.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	7	For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	8	For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	10	For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them. They shall not teach, etc.... So great shall be light and grace of the new testament, that it shall not be necessary to inculcate to the faithful the belief and knowledge of the true God, for they shall all know him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	12	Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember no more.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	13	Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end. A new.... Supply ‘covenant’. Hebrews Chapter 9 The sacrifices of the law were far inferior to that of Christ.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	1	The former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks and the table and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the Holy.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	4	Having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna and the rod of Aaron that had blossomed and the tables of the testament.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	5	And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	6	Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle, the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	7	But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own and the people’s ignorance:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost signifying this: That the way into the Holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	9	Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	10	And divers washings and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction. Of correction.... Viz., when Christ should correct and settle all things.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	11	But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption. Eternal redemption.... By that one sacrifice of his blood, once offered on the cross, Christ our Lord paid and exhibited, once for all, the general price and ransom of all mankind: which no other priest could do.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer, being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	15	And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of necessity come in.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	20	Saying: This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	21	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	23	It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	24	For Jesus is not entered into the Holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into Heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the Holies every year with the blood of others: Offer himself often.... Christ shall never more offer himself in sacrifice, in that violent, painful, and bloody manner, nor can there be any occasion for it: since by that one sacrifice upon the cross, he has furnished the full ransom, redemption, and remedy for all the sins of the world. But this hinders not that he may offer himself daily in the sacred mysteries in an unbloody manner, for the daily application of that one sacrifice of redemption to our souls.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	26	For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world. But now once, at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	28	So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many. The second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation. To exhaust.... That is, to empty, or draw out to the very bottom, by a plentiful and perfect redemption. Hebrews Chapter 10 Because of the insufficiency of the sacrifices of the law, Christ our high priest shed his own blood for us, offering up once for all the sacrifice of our redemption. He exhorts them to perseverance.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	2	For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer. They would have ceased.... If they had been of themselves perfect to all the intents of redemption and remission, as Christ’s death is there would have been no occasion of so often repeating them: as there is no occasion for Christ’s dying any more for our sins.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	3	But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore, when he cometh into the world he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	6	Holocausts for sin did not please thee.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	7	Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	8	In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	9	Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: He taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	10	In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	11	And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	12	But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	14	For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	16	And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts and on their minds will I write them:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	18	Now, where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin. There is no more an oblation for sin.... Where there is a full remission of sins, as in baptism, there is no more occasion for a sin offering to be made for such sins already remitted; and as for sins committed afterwards, they can only be remitted in virtue of the one oblation of Christ’s death.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	20	A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	21	And a high priest over the house of God:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised):	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed: but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins: If we sin wilfully.... He speaks of the sin of wilful apostasy from the known truth; after which, as we can not be baptized again, we can not expect to have that abundant remission of sins, which Christ purchased by his death, applied to our souls in that ample manner as it is in baptism: but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful judgment; the more because apostates from the known truth, seldom or never have the grace to return to it.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	27	But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	28	A man making void the law of Moses dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	29	How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	32	But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	33	And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on them that were in bands and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	35	Do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	36	For patience is necessary for you: that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come will come and will not delay.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	38	But my just man liveth by faith: but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	39	But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul. Hebrews Chapter 11 What faith is. Its wonderful fruits and efficacy demonstrated in the fathers.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	1	Now, faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	2	For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God: that from invisible things visible things might be made.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts. And by it he being dead yet speaketh.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	5	By faith Henoch was translated that he should not see death: and he was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is: and is a rewarder to them that seek him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house: by the which he condemned the world and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	8	By faith he that is called Abraham obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing whither he went. He that is called Abraham ... or, Abraham being called.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	9	By faith he abode in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city that hath foundations: whose builder and maker is God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	11	By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive seed, even past the time of age: because she believed that he was faithful who had promised,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	12	For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	13	All these died according to faith, not having received the promises but beholding them afar off and saluting them and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	14	For they that say these things do signify that they seek a country.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they had doubtless, time to return.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	18	(To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called:)	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Whereupon also he received him for a parable. For a parable.... That is, as a figure of Christ, slain and coming to life again.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	20	By faith also of things to come Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and adored the top of his rod. Adored the top of his rod.... The apostle here follows the ancient Greek Bible of the seventy interpreters, (which translates in this manner, Gen. 47. 31.,) and alleges this fact of Jacob, in paying a relative honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of Joseph, as to a figure of Christ’s sceptre and kingdom, as an instance and argument of his faith. But some translators, who are no friends to this relative honour, have corrupted the text, by translating it, he worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff; as if this circumstance of leaning upon his staff were any argument of Jacob’s faith, or worthy the being thus particularly taken notice of by the Holy Ghost.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents: because they saw he was a comely babe, and they feared not the king’s edict.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses, when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of Pharao’s daughter:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	25	Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God than to have the pleasure of sin for a time:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians. For he looked unto the reward.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king: for he endured, as seeing him that is invisible.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	28	By faith he celebrated the pasch and the shedding of the blood: that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting, were swallowed up.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, by the going round them seven days.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I yet say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, Barac, Samson, Jephthe, David, Samuel, and the prophets:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	33	Who by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle, put to flight the armies of foreigners.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again. But others were racked, not accepting deliverance, that they might find a better resurrection.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of mockeries and stripes: moreover also of bands and prisons.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned, they were cut asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted:	10	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	1	And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over our head, laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	2	Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who, having joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	3	For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	4	For you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	5	And you have forgotten the consolation which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord: neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth: and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	7	Persevere under discipline. God dealeth with you as with his sons. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	8	But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made partakers, then are you bastards and not sons.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	9	Moreover, we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them. Shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits and live?	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	10	And they indeed for a few days, according to their own pleasure, instructed us: but he, for our profit, that we might receive his sanctification.	10	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	15	Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder and by it many be defiled:	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau who for one mess sold his first birthright.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	12	17	For know ye that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the benediction, he was rejected.

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	4	Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge. Or, Let marriage be honourable in all.... That is, in all things belonging to the marriage state. This is a warning to married people, not to abuse the sanctity of their state, by any liberties or irregularities contrary thereunto. Now it does not follow from this text that all persons are obliged to marry, even if the word omnibus were rendered, in all persons, instead of in all things: for if it was a precept, St. Paul himself would have transgressed it, as he never married. Moreover, those who have already made a vow to God to lead a single life, should they attempt to marry, they would incur their own damnation. 1 Tim. 5. 12.	10	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	5	Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have. For he hath said: I will not leave thee: neither will I forsake thee.	10	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach. Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach....

The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	2	My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations: Into divers temptations.... The word temptation, in this epistle, is sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions, as in this place: at other times, it is to be understood, tempting, enticing, or drawing others into sin.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	3	Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	4	And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	5	But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.	11	DRB

The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	14	But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	15	Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	16	Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	17	Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	18	For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature. Some beginning.... That is, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	19	You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.	11	DRB

The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	21	Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	22	But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	23	For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	24	For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of man he was.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	25	But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	26	And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	27	Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world. James Chapter 2 Against respect of persons. The danger of transgressing one point of the law. Faith is dead without works.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, with respect of persons. With respect of persons.... The meaning is, that in matters relating to faith, the administering of the sacraments, and other spiritual functions in God’s church, there should be no respect of persons; but that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the rich. See Deut. 1.17.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	2	For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire:	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	3	And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel and shall say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or: Sit under my footstool:	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	4	Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	5	Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	6	But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	8	If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	9	But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	10	And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. Guilty of all; ... That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such a manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him to salvation; for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great and general commandment of charity, even by one mortal sin. For all the precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law, and as it were a chain of precepts, where, by breaking one link of this chain, the whole chain is broken, or the integrity of the law consisting of a collection of precepts. A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence against any one precept, incurs eternal punishment; yet the punishment in hell shall be greater for those who have been greater sinners, as a greater reward shall be for those in heaven who have lived with greater sanctity and perfection.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	11	For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	12	So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	13	For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	14	What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	15	And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	16	And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	17	So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	18	But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	22	Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works faith was made perfect?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	24	Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	25	And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	26	For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works is dead. James Chapter 3 Of the evils of the tongue. Of the difference between the earthly and heavenly wisdom.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	1	Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	2	For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	3	For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us: and we turn about their whole body.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	4	Behold also ships, whereas they are great and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	5	Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	7	For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the rest is tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	8	But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	9	By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men who are made after the likeness of God.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes? Or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	14	But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	15	For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	16	For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and every evil work.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	18	And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace. James Chapter 4 The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends to this world. Admonitions against pride, detraction and the like.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	1	From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	2	You covet, and have not: you kill and envy and cannot obtain. You contend and war, and you have not: because you ask not.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	3	You ask and receive not: because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your concupiscences.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	4	Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world becometh an enemy of God.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	5	Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	6	But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	7	Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil: and he will fly from you.	11	DRB

The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	9	Be afflicted and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into sorrow.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	10	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord: and he will exalt you.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	11	Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	12	There is one lawgiver and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	13	But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year and will traffic and make our gain.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	14	Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	15	For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and, If we shall live, we will do this or that.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	16	But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	17	To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is sin. James Chapter 5 A woe to the rich that oppress the poor.

The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	4	Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	5	You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.	11	DRB
The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the Just One: and he resisted you not.	11	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	2	And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God: and there were given to them seven trumpets.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	3	And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer: and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the throne of God.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	4	And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	5	And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it on the earth: and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and a great earthquake.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpet.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	7	And the first angel sounded the trumpet: and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood: and it was cast on the earth.

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	10	And the third angel sounded the trumpet: and a great star fell from heaven, burning as it were a torch. And it fell on the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters:	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became wormwood. And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened.

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	13	And I beheld: and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, Woe, Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the rest of the voices of the three angels, who are yet to sound the trumpet! Apocalypse Chapter 9 Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of horsemen.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	1	And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. A star full.... This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith. Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.... That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star. To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit: and the smoke of the pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	3	And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. There came out locusts.... These may be devils in Antichrist’s time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads. Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc. These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies. Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists: besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	5	And it was given unto them that they should not kill them: but that they should torment them five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	6	And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die: and death shall fly from them.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women: and their teeth were as lions.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	10	And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men, five months. And they had over them	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	16	And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand. And I heard the number of them.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision. And they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions: and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	18	And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads: and with them they hurt.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	20	And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk:	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	21	Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts. Apocalypse Chapter 10 The cry of a mighty angel. He gives John a book to eat.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the prophets.

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	2	But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles. And the holy city they shall tread under foot, two and forty months:	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	3	And I will give unto my two witnesses: and they shall prophesy, a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. My two witnesses.... It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias.	12	DRB

The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet: and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	1	And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns: and upon his horns, ten diadems: and upon his heads, names of blasphemy. A beast.... This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.: the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz., the empire of Rome: and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard: and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his own strength and great power.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	3	And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and his death’s wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration after the beast.

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	12	And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	13	And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down from heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	14	And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which had the wound by the sword and lived.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	15	And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast: and that the image of the beast should speak: and should cause that whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	18	Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the number of him is six hundred sixty-six. Six hundred sixty-six.... The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number.

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	3	And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.	12	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	4	These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	8	And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant. St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.	12	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	10	And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is at hand. For the time is at hand.... That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world. Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men. In fine, others think that St. John’s design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general: the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events: for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word.

APPENDICES These texts come from the 1582 Rhemes and 1610 Doway printings of the portions of the Bible. The primary sources provide a glimpse both into the history of the Douay-Rheims version and the English language itself. The reader will quickly notice that the letter ‘j’ does not appear in the texts, rather ‘i’ functions either as a vowel or a consonant. Likewise ‘u’ is not a distinct letter; it is employed typographically in the lower-case in place of ‘v’ where not starting a word. The letters ‘u’ and ‘v’ both function either as vowels or consonants. The word ‘vniuersity’ demonstrates this rule. The letter ‘w’ is often employed, but in many cases the earlier form of a double-v (vv) appears instead. The transcriber has done his best to render the text accurately. Note the relaxed spelling standards of the time; many variants appear. While the errata section from the 1610 edition observed: “We haue also found some other faultes of lesse importance; and feare there be more. But we trust the reader may easely correct them, as they occurre.” only obvious errors have been amended. Where the transcriber has doubt between whether an irregular spelling is either an error and a variant, the printed text stands. 7-bit ASCII cannot fully represent the typographical standards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many special characters have been replaced with modern equivalents.

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping) that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:	14	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction: whose God is their belly: and whose glory is in their shame: who mind earthly things.	14	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	20	But our conversation is in heaven: from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,	14	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	8	For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline: think on these things. For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, etc.... Here the apostle enumerates general precepts of morality, which they ought to practise. Whatsoever things are true.... in words, in promises, in lawful oaths, etc., he commands rectitude of mind, and sincerity of heart. Whatsoever modest.... by these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. Whatsoever just.... That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest. Whatsoever holy.... by these words may be understood, that those who are in a religious state professed, or in holy orders, should lead a life of sanctity and chastity, according to the vows they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow. Whatsoever lovely.... that is, to practise those good offices in society, that procure us the esteem and good will of our neighbours. Whatsoever of good fame.... That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline.... that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things.... that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of God might be with them.	14	DRB

In verses, in carminibus.... In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.—Ibid. For David, or to David....

The Book of Psalms	8	5	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	8	6	Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour:	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	8	7	And hast set him over the works of thy hands.	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	8	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover, the beasts also of the fields.	15	DRB

The Book of Psalms	9	4	When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	9	5	For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	9	6	Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	9	7	The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:	15	DRB
The Book of Psalms	9	8	But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment:	15	DRB

The Book of Psalms	9	21	Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men. Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible. Psalm 10 according to the Hebrews. 9a:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble? 9a:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. 9a:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. 9a:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him: 9a:5. God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. 9a:6. For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. 9a:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. 9a:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may kill the innocent. 9a:9. His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. 9a:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. 9a:11. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end. 9a:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. 9a:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. 9a:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. 9a:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. 9a:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. 9a:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. 9a:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth. Psalms Chapter 10 In Domino confido. The just man’s confidence in God in the midst of persecutions.	15	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	27	Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	28	For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law. By faith, etc.... The faith, to which the apostle here attributes man’s justification, is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified; but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised. Heb. 11. A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ. Gal. 5.6. In short, a faith which takes in hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments. And the works which he here excludes, are only the works of the law: that is, such as are done by the law of nature, or that of Moses, antecedent to the faith of Christ: but by no means, such as follow faith, and proceed from it.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	30	For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	31	Do we then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid! But we establish the law. Romans Chapter 4 Abraham was not justified by works done, as of himself, but by grace and by faith. And that before he was circumcised. Gentiles, by faith, are his children.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. By works.... Done by his own strength, without the grace of God, and faith in him. Not before God.... Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice. Reputed, etc.... By God, who reputeth nothing otherwise than it is. However, we may gather from this word, that when we are justified, our justification proceedeth from God’s free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature, abstracting from God’s grace.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace but according to debt. To him that worketh.... Vis., as of his own fund, or by his own strength. Such a man, says the apostle, challenges his reward as a debt due to his own performances; whereas he who worketh not, that is, who presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength, but seeketh justice through faith and grace, is freely justified by God’s grace.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	6	As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God reputeth justice without works:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins are covered. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.... That is, blessed are those who, by doing penance, have obtained pardon and remission of their sins, and also are covered; that is, newly clothed with the habit of grace, and vested with the stole of charity.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.... That is, blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence, that no grievous sin can be imputed to him. And, likewise, blessed is the man, who after fall into sin, hath done penance and leads a virtuous life, by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent a relapse, that sin is no more imputed to him.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	9	This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice. In the circumcision, etc.... That is, is it only for the Jews that are circumcised? No, says the apostle, but also for the uncircumcised Gentiles: who, by faith and grace, may come to justice; as Abraham did before he was circumcised.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	10	How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which he had, being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised: that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	12	And he might be the father of circumcision; not to them only that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world: but through the justice of faith.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	14	For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void: the promise is made of no effect. Be heirs.... That is, if they alone, who follow the ceremonies of the law, be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham; then that faith which was so much praised in him, will be found to be of little value. And the very promise will be made void, by which he was promised to be the father, not of the Jews only, but of all nations of believers.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	15	For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression. The law worketh wrath.... The law, abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God’s wrath.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	16	Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	17	(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations), before God, whom he believed: who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	19	And he was not weak in faith. Neither did he consider his own body, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the dead womb of Sara.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	20	In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust: but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	21	Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	22	And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	23	Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	24	But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	25	Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification. Romans Chapter 5 The grounds we have for hope in Christ. Sin and death came by Adam, grace and life by Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	1	Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	3	And not only so: but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	4	And patience trial; and trial hope;	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	5	And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	6	For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	7	For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	9	Christ died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	11	And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	12	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned. By one man.... Adam, from whom we all contracted original sin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	13	For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not. Not imputed.... That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	14	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	15	But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	18	Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	19	For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	20	Now the law entered in that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound. That sin might abound.... Not as if the law were given on purpose for sin to abound: but that it so happened through man’s perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans Chapter 6 The Christian must die to sin and live to God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	1	What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	2	God forbid! For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	3	Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	4	For we are buried together with him by baptism into death: that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer. Old man—body of sin.... Our corrupt state, subject to sin and concupiscence, coming to us from Adam, is called our old man, as our state, reformed in and by Christ, is called the new man. And the vices and sins, which then ruled in us are named the body of sin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is justified from sin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	8	Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no more. Death shall no more have dominion over him.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	10	For in that he died to sin, he died once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	11	So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin: but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of justice unto God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	15	What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	16	Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death or of obedience unto justice.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin but have obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have been delivered.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	18	Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	19	I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity: so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	20	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	21	What fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 7 We are released by Christ from the law and from the guilt of sin, though the inclination to it still tempts us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	1	Know you not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth? As long as it liveth; ... or, as long as he liveth.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	2	For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	3	Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ: that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead that we may bring forth fruit to God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	6	But now we are loosed from the law of death wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid! But I do not know sin, but by the law. For I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. Sin taking occasion.... Sin, or concupiscence, which is called sin, because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was weakened by the prohibition: the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly giving occasion to it: but occasion being taken by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	9	And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	10	And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me: and by it killed me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law indeed is holy: and the commandment holy and just and good.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	13	Was that then which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me: that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure. That it may appear sin, or that sin may appear, viz.... To be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good, to work death.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual. But I am carnal, sold under sin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	15	For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will: but the evil which I hate, that I do. I do not that good which I will, etc.... The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason: and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors: and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind. But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	18	For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will is present with me: but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	19	For the good which I will, I do not: but the evil which I will not, that I do.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	20	Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	21	I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	22	For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	24	Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	25	The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God: but with the flesh, the law of sin. Romans Chapter 8 There is no condemnation to them that, being justified by Christ, walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. Their strong hope and love of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	1	There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	2	For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	4	That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	5	For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are of the flesh: but they that are according to the spirit mind the things that are of the spirit.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	6	For the wisdom of the flesh is death: but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	7	Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God. For it is not subject to the law of God: neither can it be.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	8	And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin: but the spirit liveth, because of justification.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ, from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	14	For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	15	For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear: but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	16	For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God. The Spirit himself, etc.... By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God’s favour; by which they are much strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance: which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Phil. 2.12. And that he that thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall. 1 Cor. 10.12. See also, Rom. 11.20, 21, 22.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	17	And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	19	For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. The expectation of the creature, etc.... He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity: not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	21	Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	22	For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	23	And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit: even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	26	Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For, we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, Asketh for us.... The Spirit is said to ask, and desire for the saints, and to pray in us; inasmuch as he inspireth prayer, and teacheth us to pray.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit desireth: because he asketh for the saints according to God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	28	And we know that to them that love God all things work together unto good: to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son: that he might be the Firstborn amongst many brethren. He also predestinated, etc.... That is, God hath preordained that all his elect should be conformable to the image of his Son. We must not here offer to pry into the secrets of God’s eternal election; only firmly believe that all our good, in time and eternity, flows originally from God’s free goodness; and all our evil from man’s free will.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	30	And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	32	He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	33	Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God is he that justifieth:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	34	Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died: yea that is risen also again, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	35	Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or danger? Or persecution? Or the sword?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	36	(As it is written: For thy sake, we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	38	For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might, I am sure.... That is, I am persuaded; as it is in the Greek, pepeismai.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 9 The apostle’s concern for the Jews. God’s election is free and not confined to their nation.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	1	I speak the truth in Christ: I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	2	That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	3	For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren: who are my kinsmen according to the flesh: Anathema; ... A curse. The apostle’s concern and love for his countrymen the Jews was so great, that he was willing to suffer even an anathema, or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites: to whom belongeth the adoption as of children and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel. All are not Israelites, etc.... Not all, who are the carnal seed of Israel, are true Israelites in God’s account: who, as by his free grace, he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election and mercy, raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	7	Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children: but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	8	That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are the children of God: but they that are the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come. And Sara shall have a son.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	10	And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	11	For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand): Not yet born, etc.... By this example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in his election, mercy and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined; nor to any prerogative of birth, or any forgoing merits. For as, antecedently to his grace, he sees no merits in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath: there is no one whom he might not justly leave in that mass; so that whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy: and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice. As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution of the other.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	12	Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	13	As it is written: Jacob I have loved: but Esau I have hated.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid!	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Not of him that willeth, etc.... That is, by any power or strength of his own, abstracting from the grace of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. To this purpose, etc.... Not that God made him on purpose that he should sin, and so be damned; but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin, and the abuse of his own free will, he raised him up to be a mighty king, to make a more remarkable example of him: and that his power might be better known, and his justice in punishing him, published throughout the earth.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	18	Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will. And whom he will, he hardeneth. He hardeneth.... Not by being the cause or author of his sin, but by withholding his grace, and so leaving him in his sin, in punishment of his past demerits.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? For who resisteth his will?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	20	O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	21	Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour? The potter.... This similitude is used only to shew that we are not to dispute with our Maker, nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another; for since the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy, that he makes out of it so many vessels of honor; and it is no more than just, that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels of dishonor.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	23	That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared unto glory?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	24	Even us, whom also he hath called, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	25	As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy; one that hath obtained mercy.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	26	And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them: you are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	27	And Isaias cried out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved. A remnant.... That is, a small number only of the children of Israel shall be converted and saved. How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions, when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel!	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	28	For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	29	And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabbaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who followed not after justice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	31	But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	32	Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	33	As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a rock of scandal. And whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded. Romans Chapter 10 The end of the law is faith in Christ, which the Jews refusing to submit to, cannot be justified.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	1	Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is for them unto salvation.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	3	For they, not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God. The justice of God.... That is, the justice which God giveth us through Christ; as on the other hand, the Jews’ own justice is, that which they pretended to by their own strength, or by the observance of the law, without faith in Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	4	For the end of the law is Christ: unto justice to everyone that believeth.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	5	For Moses wrote that the justice which is of the law: The man that shall do it shall live by it.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	6	But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart: Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down;	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	7	Or who shall descend into the deep? That is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	8	But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee; even in thy mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	9	For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Thou shalt be saved.... To confess the Lord Jesus, and to call upon the name of the Lord (ver. 13) is not barely the professing a belief in the person of Christ; but moreover, implies a belief of his whole doctrine, and an obedience to his law; without which, the calling him Lord will save no man. St. Matt. 7.21.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	10	For, with the heart, we believe unto justice: but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things? Unless they be sent.... Here is an evident proof against all new teachers, who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any lawful mission, derived by succession from the apostles, to whom Christ said, John 20.21, As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	16	But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	17	Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	18	But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily: Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the whole world.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	19	But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation: by a foolish nation I will anger you.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	20	But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me. I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not and contradicteth me. Romans Chapter 11 God hath not cast off all Israel. The Gentiles must not be proud but stand in faith and fear.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	1	I say then: Hath God cast away his people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias, how he calleth on God against Israel?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	3	Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars. And I am left alone: and they seek my life.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	4	But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal. Seven thousand, etc.... This is very ill alleged by some, against the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ; the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of Jezabel in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Judah.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	5	Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	6	And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace. It is not now by works, etc.... If salvation were to come by works, done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such dead works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation. It is not the same with regard to works done with, and by, God’s grace; for to such works as these, he has promised eternal salvation.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	7	What then? That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it. And the rest have been blinded.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	8	As it is written: God hath given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, until this present day. God hath given them, etc.... Not by his working or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their obstinacy.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	9	And David saith: Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	11	I say then: Have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid! But by their offence salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them. That they should fall.... The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only, (many thousands of them having been at first converted,) and for a time; which fall of theirs, God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	12	Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the diminution of them the riches of the Gentiles: how much more the fulness of them?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	13	For I say to you, Gentiles: As long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	15	For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root: but the root thee.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	20	Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear. Thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.... We see here that he who standeth by faith may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	21	For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps also he spare not thee.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.... The Gentiles are here admonished not to be proud, nor to glory against the Jews: but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they be cast off. Not that the whole church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, wert grafted into the good olive tree: how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	25	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery (lest you should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	26	And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	27	And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. For the gifts and the calling of God are without.... his repenting himself of them; for the promises of God are unchangeable, nor can he repent of conferring his gifts.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	30	For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	31	So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all. Concluded all in unbelief.... He hath found all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, in unbelief and sin; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own free will; so that their calling and election is purely owing to his mercy.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	1	Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. Eat all things.... Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine’s flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	23	But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin. Discerneth.... That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his conscience, what he deems unclean. Of faith.... By faith is here understood judgment and conscience: to act against which is always a sin. Romans Chapter 15 He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	1	Now, we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	2	Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	3	For Christ did not please himself: but, as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	4	For what things soever were written were written for our learning: that, through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind, one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	6	That with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	7	Wherefore, receive one another, as Christ also hath received you, unto the honour of God.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: Minister of the circumcision.... That is, executed his office and ministry towards the Jews, the people of the circumcision.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	9	But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles and will sing to thy name.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	10	And again he saith: rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	11	And again: praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles: and magnify him, all ye people.	16	DRB
The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	12	And again, Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	15	But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given me from God,	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	17	I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	25	But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.	16	DRB

The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	27	For it hath pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.	16	DRB

The Book of Ruth	1	1	In the days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	2	He was named Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	4	And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	5	And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	6	And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with both her daughters in law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people, and had given them food.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters in law: and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	8	She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	9	May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	10	And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	11	But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	12	Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	13	If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man’s estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother in law.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	15	And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her. To her gods, etc.... Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the false gods she had formerly worshipped: but by this manner of speech, insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her false gods and return to the Lord the God of Israel.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	16	She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	17	The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more also, if aught but death part me and thee. The Lord do so and so, etc.... A form of swearing usual in the history of the Old Testament, by which the person wished such and such evils to fall upon them, if they did not do what they said.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	18	Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	19	So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	20	But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful,) but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	21	I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted?	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	1	22	So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter in law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest. Ruth Chapter 2 Ruth gleaneth in the field of Booz, who sheweth her favour.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	1	Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	2	And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder, that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	3	She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	4	And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	5	And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	6	And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi, from the land of Moab,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	7	And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	8	And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	9	And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	10	She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a woman of another country?	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	11	And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	12	The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	13	And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	14	And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	15	And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	16	And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	17	She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	18	Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother in law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	19	And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned today, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man’s name, that he was called Booz.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	20	And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	21	And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	22	And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man’s field some one may resist thee.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	2	23	So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns. Ruth Chapter 3 Ruth instructed by her mother in law lieth at Booz’s feet, claiming him for her husband by the law of affinity: she receiveth a good answer, and six measures of barley.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	1	After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	2	This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	4	And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	5	She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	6	And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	7	And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	8	And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	9	And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	10	And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich. Thy latter kindness, viz.... to thy husband deceased in seeking to keep up his name and family by marrying his relation according to the law, and not following after young men. For Booz, it seems, was then in years.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	11	Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	12	Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	13	Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	14	So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	15	And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	16	And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	17	And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	3	18	And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said. Ruth Chapter 4 Upon the refusal of the nearer kinsman, Booz marrieth Ruth, who bringeth forth Obed, the grandfather of David.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	1	Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	2	And Booz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	3	They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	4	I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	5	And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman’s hand, thou must take also Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	6	He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	7	Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	8	So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	9	And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and Chelion’s, and Mahalon’s, of the hand of Noemi:	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	10	And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	11	Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients, answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem: Ephrata.... Another name of Bethlehem.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	12	And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	13	Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	14	And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	15	And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	16	And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	17	And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.	17	DRB
The Book of Ruth	4	18	These are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esron,	17	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	2	Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	6	Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	7	That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	8	For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation which came to us in Asia: that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	9	But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	10	Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	11	You helping withal in prayer for us. That for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	12	For our glory is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	14	As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory: as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia: and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	17	Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	18	But God is faithful: for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not: It is and It is not. But, It is, was in him. It is, was in him.... There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, It is, and at other times saying, It is not. But their doctrine was ever the same, one uniform yea, in Jesus Christ, one Amen, that is, one truth in him.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God are in him, It is. Therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	21	Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ and that hath anointed us, is God:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	22	Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	23	But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy. For in faith you stand. 2 Corinthians Chapter 2 He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same to you: that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	5	And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me: but in part, that I may not burden you all.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	6	To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	7	So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your charity towards him.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	10	And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ: I also.... The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, in the person and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian, whom before he had put under penance, which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	11	That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	12	And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	15	For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved and in them that perish.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	16	To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? The odour of death, etc.... The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God: but with sincerity: but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 He needs no commendatory letters. The glory of the ministry of the New Testament.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	2	You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	3	Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written: not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	4	And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter but in the spirit. For the letter killeth: but the spirit quickeneth. The letter.... Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	7	Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious (so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance), which is made void:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	14	But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	15	But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	16	But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	18	But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians Chapter 4 The sincerity of his preaching. His comfort in his afflictions.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	2	But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God: but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience, in the sight of God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	3	And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord: and ourselves your servants through Jesus.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God and not of us.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	8	In all things we suffer tribulation: but are not distressed. We are straitened: but are not destitute.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	9	We suffer persecution: but are not forsaken. We are cast down: but we perish not.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake: that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us: but life in you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe. For which cause we speak also:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and place us with you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes: that the grace, abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not: but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	17	For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure, exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal: but the things which are not seen, are eternal. 2 Corinthians Chapter 5 He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord. His charity to the Corinthians.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	1	For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	2	For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	3	Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	4	For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	5	Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	6	Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	7	(For we walk by faith and not by sight.)	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	8	But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	9	And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. The proper things of the body.... In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men: but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	12	We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf: that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	14	For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	15	And Christ died for all: that they also who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh: but now we know him so no longer. We know no man according to the flesh.... That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	17	If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	19	For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins. And he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	20	For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	21	Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us: that we might be made the justice of God in him. Sin for us.... That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin. 2 Corinthians Chapter 6 He exhorts them to a correspondence with God’s grace and not to associate with unbelievers.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	1	And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	2	For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day of salvation.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	4	But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	5	In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	6	In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	7	In the word of truth, in the power of God: by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour: by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true: as unknown and yet known:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	9	As dying and behold we live: as chastised and not killed:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching many: as having nothing and possessing all things.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians: our heart is enlarged.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	12	You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are straitened.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	13	But having the same recompense (I speak as to my children): be you also enlarged.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	14	Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God: as God saith: I will dwell in them and walk among them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore: Go out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	18	And I will receive you. And will be a Father to you: and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians Chapter 7 The apostle’s affection for the Corinthians. His comfort and joy on their account.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	2	Receive us. We have injured no man: we have corrupted no man: we have overreached no man.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before that you are in our hearts: to die together and to live together.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence for you: great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	5	For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest: but we suffered all tribulation. Combats without: fears within.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	6	But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me: so that I rejoiced the more.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	8	For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent. And if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	9	Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge. In all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it: but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	13	Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	14	And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame: but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	15	And his bowels are more abundantly towards you: remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you. 2 Corinthians Chapter 8 He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of Jerusalem.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	1	Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	2	That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity. Simplicity.... That is, sincere bounty and charity.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	4	With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	5	And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God;	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	7	That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us: so in this grace also you may abound.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	8	I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform ye it also in deed: that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	12	For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath: not according to that which he hath not.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	14	In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an equality,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	15	As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	16	And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	18	We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	19	And not that only: but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	21	For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also before men.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much confidence in you,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	23	Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf. 2 Corinthians Chapter 9 A further exhortation to almsgiving. The fruits of it.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	1	For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	2	For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past. And your emulation hath provoked very many.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	3	Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	4	Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	6	Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	7	Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound in you: that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	9	As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	10	And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	11	That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	12	Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	13	By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them and unto all.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	14	And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. 2 Corinthians Chapter 10 To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the power of his apostleship.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	5	And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	6	And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	7	See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ’s let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we also.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	8	For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	9	But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	10	(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	13	But we will not glory beyond our measure: but according to the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	15	Not glorying beyond measure in other men’s labours: but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	16	Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel: not to glory in another man’s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	18	For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom God commendeth. 2 Corinthians Chapter 11 He is forced to commend himself and his labours, lest the Corinthians should be imposed upon by the false apostles.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	1	Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly! But do bear with me. My folly.... So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel, which you have not received: you might well bear with him.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	6	For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge: but in all things we have been made manifest to you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached unto you the Gospel of God freely?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	8	I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	9	And, when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia. And in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you: and so I will keep myself.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	10	The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do: that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion: that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	13	For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	16	I say again (Let no man think me to be foolish: otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little):	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I speak not according to God: but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	19	For you gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	20	For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	21	I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	22	They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	23	They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes save one.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods: once I was stoned: thrice I suffered shipwreck: a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	26	In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	27	In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches. My daily instance.... The labours that come in, and press upon me every day.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	32	At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall: and so escaped his hands. 2 Corinthians Chapter 12 His raptures and revelations, His being buffeted by Satan. His fear for the Corinthians.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	1	If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ: above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	4	That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	5	For such an one I will glory: but for myself I will glory nothing but in my infirmities.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	6	For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	7	And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	8	For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart from me.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	9	And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Power is made perfect.... The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	10	For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	11	I am become foolish. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you. For I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	12	Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	13	For what is there that you have had less than the other churches but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	14	Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	15	But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls: although loving you more, I be loved less.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	16	But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	17	Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus: and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not in the same steps?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	19	Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	21	Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed. 2 Corinthians Chapter 13 He threatens the impenitent, to provoke them to penance.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	1	Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	2	I have told before and foretell, as present and now absent, to them that sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	3	Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	4	For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	5	Try your own selves if you be in the faith: prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray God that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as reprobates. Reprobates.... that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth: but for the truth.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	11	For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace. And the God of peace and of love shall be with you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	12	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	13	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.	18	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	1	The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth, The ancient.... That is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one of the twelve apostles then living. To the lady Elect.... Some conjecture that Electa might be the name of a family, or of a particular church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this Epistle from St. John.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	And this is charity: That we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him: God speed you. Nor say to him, God speed you.... This admonition is in general, to forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of every one, even of our enemies.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	11	For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	12	Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that your joy may be full.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	13	The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.	19	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	1	Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ: to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	2	Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	3	As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	4	By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises: that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature: flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	5	And you, employing all care, minister in your faith, virtue: And in virtue, knowledge:	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	6	And in knowledge, abstinence: and in abstinence, patience: and in patience, godliness:	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	7	And in godliness, love of brotherhood: and in love of brotherhood, charity.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	8	For if these things be with you and abound, they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	9	For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	10	Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the ever-lasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	12	For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the present truth.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	13	But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	14	Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	15	And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease whereby you may keep a memory of these things.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	16	For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ: but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	18	And this voice, we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	19	And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	20	Understanding this first: That no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation.... This shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one’s private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world. Some may tell us, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures: they may do so, but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	21	For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter Chapter 2 He warns them against false teachers and foretells their punishment.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	1	But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction. Seeds of perdition.... That is, heresies destructive of salvation.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	2	And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not: and their perdition slumbereth not.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment:	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	5	And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.	20	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented:	20	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	11	Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment. Bring not a railing judgment, etc....

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	12	But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption:	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	13	Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day: stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in their feasts with you: The delights of a day: that is, the short delights of this world, in which they place all their happiness.	20	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	17	These are fountains without water and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	18	For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape, such as converse in error:	20	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	20	For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and overcome: their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	22	For, that of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog is returned to his vomit; and: The sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. 2 Peter Chapter 3 Against scoffers denying the second coming of Christ.

The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	14	Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	15	And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation: as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:	20	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.	20	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, A revolt.... This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the ancient fathers, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church; which has, in part, happened already, by means of Mahomet, Luther, &c., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the Antichrist. The man of sin.... Here must be meant some particular man, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article: o`, ‘the’ man of sin, ‘the’ son of perdition, ‘the’ adversary or opposer. It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the world.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.	21	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	8	And then that wicked one shall be revealed: whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: him	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	9	Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power and signs and lying wonders:	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	10	And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish: because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying: God shall send.... That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	11	That all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have consented to iniquity.	21	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	14	Therefore, brethren, stand fast: and hold the traditions, which you have learned, whether by word or by our epistle. Traditions.... See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be received than their epistles.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	15	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope in grace,	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	16	Exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word. 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3 He begs their prayers and warns them against idleness.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	1	For the rest, brethren, pray for us that the word of God may run and may be glorified, even as among you: May run.... That is, may spread itself, and have free course.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	2	And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men: for all men have not faith.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	3	But God is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.	21	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us. For we were not disorderly among you.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing: but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	9	Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	10	For also, when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.	21	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	11	For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly: working not at all, but curiously meddling.	21	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	6	For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.	22	DRB
The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power and of love and of sobriety.	22	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	12	For which cause, I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.	22	DRB

The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day.

The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church. Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God:	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles. Taking nothing of the Gentiles....

The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works which he doth, with malicious words prating against us. And as if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church. Diotrephes who loveth.... This man seemeth to be in power, but not a friend to the faithful; therefore this part of the letter might be an admonition to him from the apostle.	23	DRB

THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JUDE St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and brother to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles were then living, except St. John. He inveighs against the heresies and wicked practices of the Simonians, Nicolaites, and Gnostics, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes, He exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics. Jude Chapter 1 He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	1	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James: to them that are beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	Mercy unto you and peace: and charity be fulfilled.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long ago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day. Principality.... That is, the state in which they were first created, their original dignity.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise dominion and blaspheme majesty. Blaspheme majesty.... Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even utter blasphemies against the divine majesty.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee. Contended about the body, etc.... This contention, which is no where else mentioned in holy writ, was originally known by revelation, and transmitted by tradition. It is thought the occasion of it was, that the devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner, as to be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours. Command thee.... or rebuke thee.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	11	Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have perished in the contradiction of Core. Gone in the way, etc.... Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam, by putting a scandal before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	12	These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by winds: trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion: wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	14	Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints: Prophesied.... This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that is since lost.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	15	To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for all the works of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly: and for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	16	These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own desires: and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring persons, for gain’s sake.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	17	But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful, etc.... He now exhorts the faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had heard from the apostles, who had also foretold that in aftertimes (lit. in the last time) there should be false teachers, scoffing and ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to their passions and lusts; who separate themselves from the Catholic communion by heresies and schisms. Sensual men.... carried away and enslaved by the pleasures of the senses.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	18	Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers, walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	19	These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not the Spirit.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	20	But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting. Building yourselves upon your most holy faith.... Raising by your actions, a spiritual building, founded, 1st, upon faith; 2d, on the love of God; 3d, upon hope, whilst you are waiting for the mercies of God, and the reward of eternal life; 4th, joined with the great duty of prayer.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	22	And some indeed reprove, being judged:	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	23	But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal. And some indeed reprove being judged.... He gives them another instruction to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour, where they will meet with three sorts of persons: 1st, With persons obstinate in their errors and sins; these may be said to be already judged and condemned; they are to be sharply reprehended, reproved, and if possible convinced of their error. 2d, As to others you must endeavour to save them, by pulling them, as it were, out of the fire, from the ruin they stand in great danger of. 3d, You must have mercy on others in fear, when you see them through ignorance of frailty, in danger of being drawn into the snares of these heretics; with these you must deal more gently and mildly, with a charitable compassion, hating always, and teaching others to hate the carnal garment which is spotted, their sensual and corrupt manners, that defile both the soul and body.	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	24	Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:	23	DRB
The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	25	To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen. Now to him, etc.... St. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of praising God, and praying to the only God our Saviour, which may either signify God the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the three persons, who are equally the cause of Christ’s incarnation, and man’s salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, being God from eternity, took upon him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer.	23	DRB

This can not be meant of all the things prophesied in the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. That some things were to come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches, chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly.

Apocalypse Chapter 9 Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of horsemen.	25	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	1	And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. A star full.... This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith. Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.... That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star. To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.	25	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	3	And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. There came out locusts.... These may be devils in Antichrist’s time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads. Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc. These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies. Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists: besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.	25	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.	25	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	9	And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron: and the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.	25	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	10	And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men, five months. And they had over them	25	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	11	A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).	25	DRB
The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	12	One woe is past: and behold there come yet two woes more hereafter.	25	DRB

And the inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not. The beast which thou sawest.... This beast which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil: which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist. The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap. 13.1, and below, ver. 10.) The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.	25	DRB

St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant. St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.	25	DRB

The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	10	And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is at hand. For the time is at hand.... That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world. Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men. In fine, others think that St. John’s design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general: the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events: for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word.
