THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	3	I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a pure conscience, that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	4	Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	5	Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice, and I am certain that in thee also.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	6	For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power and of love and of sobriety.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but labour with the gospel, according to the power of God.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	9	Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	10	But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and incorruption by the gospel. By the illumination.... That is, by the bright coming and appearing of our Saviour.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	11	Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	12	For which cause, I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	13	Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me: in faith and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	14	Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	15	Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia are turned away from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	16	The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath often refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain:	1

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	18	The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day. And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest. 2 Timothy Chapter 2 He exhorts him to diligence in his office and patience in suffering. The danger of the delusions of heretics.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	2	And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	3	Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	4	No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	5	For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	6	The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	7	Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	8	Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	9	Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer. But the word of God is not bound.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	11	A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	12	If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	13	If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	14	Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words: for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	15	Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	16	But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	17	And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	18	Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	19	But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	21	If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	22	But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	23	And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	24	But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward all men, apt to teach, patient,	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	25	With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	26	And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by whom they are held captive at his will. 2 Timothy Chapter 3 The character of heretics of latter days. He exhorts Timothy to constancy. Of the great profit of the knowledge of the scriptures.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	1	Know also this, that in the last days shall come dangerous times.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	2	Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	3	Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	4	Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	5	Having an appearance indeed of godliness but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	6	For of these sort are they who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	7	Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	8	Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. Jannes and Mambres.... The magicians of king Pharao.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	9	But they shall proceed no farther: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	11	Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	12	And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	13	But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error,	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	14	But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned and which have been committed to thee, knowing of whom thou hast learned them:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	15	And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures which can instruct thee to salvation by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	16	All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice: All scripture, ... Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable for all these ends. But, if we would have the whole rule of Christian faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures, which Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the Old Testament alone: nor yet with the New Testament, without taking along with it the traditions of the apostles, and the interpretation of the church, to which the apostles delivered both the book, and the true meaning of it.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	17	That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work. 2 Timothy Chapter 4 His charge to Timothy. He tells him of his approaching death and desires him to come to him.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	1	I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	2	Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	3	For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	4	And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	5	But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober. An evangelist ... a diligent preacher of the gospel.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	6	For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	7	I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course: I have kept the faith.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	8	As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	9	For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	10	Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	13	The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee: and the books, especially the parchments.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	15	Whom do thou also avoid: for he hath greatly withstood our words.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	16	At my first answer, no man stood with me: but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	17	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished and that all the Gentiles may hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	18	The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	19	Salute Prisca, and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	21	Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren, salute thee.	1
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.	1
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	1	Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ: to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	2	Grace be unto you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	3	I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	4	Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all with joy:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	5	For your communication in the gospel of Christ, from the first day until now.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	6	Being confident of this very thing: that he who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	7	As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that, in my bands and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	8	For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	9	And this I pray: That your charity may more and more abound in knowledge and in all understanding:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	10	That you may approve the better things: that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	11	Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	12	Now, brethren, I desire you should know that the things which have happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	13	So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court and in all other places.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	15	Some indeed, even out of envy and contention: but some also for good will preach Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	16	Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	17	And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	18	But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	19	For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	20	According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded: but with all confidence, as always, so now also, shall Christ be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	21	For to me, to live is Christ: and to die is gain.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	22	And if to live in the flesh: this is to me the fruit of labour. And what I shall choose I know not. This is to me, etc.... His meaning is, that although his dying immediately for Christ would be his gain, by putting him presently in possession of heaven; yet he is doubtful what he should choose, because by staying longer in the flesh, he should be more beneficial to the souls of his neighbours.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	23	But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	24	But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	26	That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	27	Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	28	And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	29	For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	1	30	Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me and now have heard of me. Philippians Chapter 2 He recommends them to unity and humility, and to work out their salvation with fear and trembling.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	2	Fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	3	Let nothing be done through contention: neither by vain glory. But in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	4	Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men’s.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	5	For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	6	Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	7	But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man. Emptied himself, exinanivit.... made himself as of no account.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	8	He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	9	For which cause, God also hath exalted him and hath given him a name which is above all names:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	10	That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	12	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation. With fear, etc.... This is against the false faith, and presumptuous security of modern sectaries.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	13	For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	14	And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	15	That you may be blameless and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation: among whom you shine as lights in the world.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	16	Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ: because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	17	Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	18	And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate with me.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	19	And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	20	For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	21	For all seek the things that are their own not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	22	Now know ye the proof of him: that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately: so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	24	And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you shortly.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	25	But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier, but your apostle: and he that hath ministered to my wants.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	26	For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	27	For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him. And not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	28	Therefore, I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	29	Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord: and treat with honour such as he is.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service. Philippians Chapter 3 He warneth them against false teachers. He counts all other things loss, that he may gain Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	1	As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you is necessary.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	2	Beware of dogs: beware of evil workers: beware of the concision.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	3	For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	5	Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews. According to the law, a Pharisee:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	6	According to zeal, persecuting the church of God: According to the justice that is in the law, conversing without blame.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	7	But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	8	Furthermore, I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	9	And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God: justice in faith.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	10	That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings: being made conformable to his death,	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	11	If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	12	Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	13	Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth myself to those that are before,	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	14	I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you,	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	16	Nevertheless, whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	17	Be ye followers of me, brethren: and observe them who walk so as you have our model.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	18	For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping) that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	19	Whose end is destruction: whose God is their belly: and whose glory is in their shame: who mind earthly things.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	20	But our conversation is in heaven: from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	3	21	Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself. Philippians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to perseverance in all good and acknowledges their charitable contributions to him.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	1	Therefore my dearly beloved brethren and most desired, my joy and my crown: so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	2	I beg of Evodia and I beseech Syntyche to be of one mind in the Lord.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	3	And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always: again, I say, rejoice.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	5	Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	6	Be nothing solicitous: but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	8	For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline: think on these things. For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, etc.... Here the apostle enumerates general precepts of morality, which they ought to practise. Whatsoever things are true.... in words, in promises, in lawful oaths, etc., he commands rectitude of mind, and sincerity of heart. Whatsoever modest.... by these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. Whatsoever just.... That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest. Whatsoever holy.... by these words may be understood, that those who are in a religious state professed, or in holy orders, should lead a life of sanctity and chastity, according to the vows they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow. Whatsoever lovely.... that is, to practise those good offices in society, that procure us the esteem and good will of our neighbours. Whatsoever of good fame.... That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline.... that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things.... that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of God might be with them.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	9	The things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, these do ye: and the God of peace shall be with you.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	10	Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	11	I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	12	I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound (every where and in all things I am instructed): both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound and to suffer need.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	13	I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	14	Nevertheless, you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	15	And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	16	For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	17	Not that I seek the gift: but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	18	But I have all and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	19	And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	20	Now to God and our Father be glory, world without end. Amen.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	21	Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	22	The brethren who are with me salute you. All the saints salute you: especially they that are of Caesar’s household.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.	2
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	2	And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	3	Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	4	I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	5	Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and towards all the saints:	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	6	That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	7	For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	8	Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to command thee that which is to the purpose:	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	9	For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	10	I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	11	Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is profitable both to me and thee:	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	12	Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	14	But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou mightest receive him again for ever:	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	16	Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me. But how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	17	If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	18	And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put that to my account.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	19	I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	20	Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord! Refresh my bowels in the Lord.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	21	Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	22	But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus:	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	24	Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.	3
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO PHILEMON	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.	3
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	1	The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and to teach,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	2	Until the day on which, giving commandments by the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	3	To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many proofs, for forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	4	And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	5	For John indeed baptized with water: but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	6	They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	7	But he said to them: It is not for you to know the times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own power:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	8	But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the uttermost part of the earth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	9	And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised up: and a cloud received him out of their sight.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	10	And while they were beholding him going up to heaven, behold two men stood by them in white garments.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	11	Who also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come as you have seen him going into heaven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day’s journey.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes and Jude the brother of James.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	14	All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	15	In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said (now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty):	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	16	Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader of them that apprehended Jesus:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	17	Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	18	And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of iniquity, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	19	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so that the same field was called in their tongue, Haceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	20	For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein. And his bishopric let another take.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	21	Wherefore of these men who have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	22	Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	23	And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	24	And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the heart of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	25	To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	1	26	And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. Acts Chapter 2 The disciples receive the Holy Ghost. Peter’s sermon to the people. The piety of the first converts.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	1	And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming: and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	3	And there appeared to them parted tongues, as it were of fire: and it sat upon every one of them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	4	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost: and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	5	Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	6	And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	7	And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these that speak Galileans?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	8	And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	11	Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	12	And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	13	But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	14	But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you and with your ears receive my words.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	15	For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	16	But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	17	And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord), I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	18	And upon my servants indeed and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit: and they shall prophesy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	19	And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	20	The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord shall come.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	21	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	23	This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain. By the determinate, etc.... God delivered up his Son; and his Son delivered up himself, for the love of us, and for the sake of our salvation; and so Christ’s being delivered up was holy, and was God’s own determination. But they who betrayed and crucified him, did wickedly, following therein their own malice and the instigation of the devil; not the will and determination of God, who was by no means the author of their wickedness; though he permitted it; because he could, and did draw out of it so great a good, viz., the salvation of man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	24	Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it. Having loosed the sorrow, etc.... Having overcome the grievous pains of death and all the power of hell.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	25	For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	26	For this my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	27	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell: nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	29	Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David: that he died and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present day.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	30	Whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	31	Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell: neither did his flesh see corruption.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	32	This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	33	Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	34	For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	35	Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	37	Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	38	But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	39	For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	40	And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	41	They therefore that received his word were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	42	And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	43	And fear came upon every soul. Many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem: and there was great fear in all.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	44	And all they that believed were together and had all things common.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	45	Their possessions and goods they sold and divided them to all, according as every one had need.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	46	And continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	2	47	Praising God and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved. Acts Chapter 3 The miracle upon the lame man, followed by the conversion of many.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	1	Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	2	And a certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	3	He, when he had seen Peter and John, about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	4	But Peter with John, fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	5	But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	6	But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	7	And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up: and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	8	And he leaping up, stood and walked and went in with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	10	And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	11	And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them, to the porch which is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	12	But Peter seeing, made answer to the people: Ye men of Israel, why wonder you at this? Or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made this man to walk?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	13	The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	14	But you denied the Holy One and the Just: and desired a murderer to be granted unto you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	15	But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead: of which we are witnesses.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	16	And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known, hath his name strengthened. And the faith which is by him hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	17	And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance: as did also your rulers.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	18	But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	19	Be penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	20	That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the Lord, and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you, Jesus Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	21	Whom heaven indeed must receive, until the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the beginning of the world.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	22	For Moses said: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me: him you shall hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	23	And it shall be, that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	24	And all the prophets, from Samuel and afterwards, who have spoken, have told of these days.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	25	You are the children of the prophets and of the testament which God made to our fathers, saying to Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	3	26	To you first, God, raising up his Son, hath sent him to bless you: that every one may convert himself from his wickedness. Acts Chapter 4 Peter and John are apprehended. Their constancy. The church is increased.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	1	And as they were speaking to the people the priests and the officer of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	2	Being grieved that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	3	And they laid hands upon them and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	4	But many of them who had heard the word believed: and the number of the men was made five thousand.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their princes and ancients and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	6	And Annas the high priest and Caiphas and John and Alexander: and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	7	And setting them in the midst, they asked: By what power or by what name, have you done this?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them: Ye princes of the people and ancients, hear.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	9	If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he hath been made whole:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	10	Be it known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by him, this man standeth here before you, whole.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	11	This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is become the head of the corner.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	12	Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	13	Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered: and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	14	Seeing the man also who had been healed, standing with them, they could say nothing against it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	15	But they commanded them to go aside out of the council: and they conferred among themselves,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	16	Saying: What shall we do to these men? For indeed a miracle hath been done by them, known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. It is manifest: and we cannot deny it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	17	But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	18	And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	19	But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just, in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	21	But they, threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified what had been done, in that which had come to pass.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	22	For the man was above forty years old, in whom that miraculous cure had been wrought.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	23	And being let go, they came to their own company and related all that the chief priests and ancients had said to them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	24	Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea and all things that are in them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	25	Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hast said: Why did the Gentiles rage: and the people meditate vain things?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	26	The kings of the earth stood up: and the princes assembled together against the Lord and his Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	27	For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	28	To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants that with all confidence they may speak thy word,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	30	By stretching forth thy hand to cures and signs and wonders, to be done by the name of thy holy Son, Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	31	And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were assembled: and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost: and they spoke the word of God with confidence.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	32	And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul. Neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed was his own: but all things were common unto them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	33	And with great power did the Apostles give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord: and great grace was in them all.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	34	For neither was there any one needy among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of the things they sold,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	35	And laid it down before the feet of the apostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	36	And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas (which is, by interpretation, The son of consolation), a Levite, a Cyprian born,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	4	37	Having land, sold it and brought the price and laid it at the feet of the Apostles. Acts Chapter 5 The judgment of God upon Ananias and Saphira. The apostles are cast into prison.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	2	And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land, his wife being privy thereunto: and bringing a certain part of it, laid it at the feet of the apostles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	3	But Peter said: Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost and by fraud keep part of the price of the land?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	4	Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee? And after it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	5	And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the ghost. And there came great fear upon all that heard it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	6	And the young men rising up, removed him, and carrying him out, buried him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	8	And Peter said to her: Tell me, woman, whether you sold the land for so much? And she said: Yea, for so much.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	9	And Peter said unto her: Why have you agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the door: and they shall carry thee out,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	10	Immediately, she fell down before his feet and gave up the ghost. And the young men coming in found her dead: and carried her out and buried her by her husband.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	11	And there came great fear upon the whole church and upon all that heard these things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	13	But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them: but the people magnified them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	14	And the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord was more increased:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	15	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that, when Peter came, his shadow at the least might overshadow any of them and they might be delivered from their infirmities.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	16	And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude out of the neighbouring cities, bringing sick persons and such as were troubled with unclean spirits: who were all healed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	17	Then the high priest rising up, and all they that were with him (which is the heresy of the Sadducees) were filled with envy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	18	And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	19	But an angel of the Lord by night, opening the doors of the prison and leading them out, said:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	20	Go, and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	21	Who having heard this, early in the morning, entered into the temple and taught. And the high priest coming, and they that were with him, called together the council and all the ancients of the children of Israel: and they sent to the prison to have them brought.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	22	But when the ministers came and opening the prison found them not there, they returned and told,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	23	Saying: The prison indeed we found shut with all diligence, and the keepers standing before the doors; but opening it, we found no man within.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	24	Now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what would come to pass.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	25	But one came and told them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	26	Then went the officer with the ministers and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	28	Saying: Commanding, we commanded you that you should not teach in this name. And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine: and you have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	29	But Peter and the apostles answering, said: We ought to obey God rather than men.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	30	The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom you put to death, hanging him upon a tree.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	32	And we are witnesses of these things: and the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to all that obey him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	33	When they had heard these things, they were cut to the heart: and they thought to put them to death.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	34	But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a little while.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	35	And he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these men.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	36	For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves. Who was slain: and all that believed him were scattered and brought to nothing.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	37	After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him. He also perished: and all, even as many as consented to him, were dispersed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	38	And now, therefore, I say to you: Refrain from these men and let them alone. For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to nought:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	39	But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God. And they consented to him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	40	And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus. And they dismissed them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	41	And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	5	42	And every day they ceased not, in the temple and from house to house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus. Acts Chapter 6 The ordination of the seven deacons. The zeal of Stephen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	1	And in those days, the number of the disciples increasing, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, for that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Greeks.... So they called the Jews that were born and brought up in Greece.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	2	Then the twelve, calling together the multitude of the disciples, said: It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	3	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	5	And the saying was liked by all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor, and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	6	These they set before the apostles: and they praying, imposed hands upon them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	7	And the word of the Lord increased: and the number of the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	8	And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great wonders and signs among the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	9	Now there arose some, of that which is called the synagogue of the Libertines and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that spoke.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	11	Then they suborned men to say they had heard him speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	12	And they stirred up the people and the ancients and the scribes. And running together, they took him and brought him to the council.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	13	And they set up false witnesses, who said: This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place and the law.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	14	For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the traditions which Moses delivered unto us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	6	15	And all that sat in the council, looking on him, saw his face as if it had been the face of an angel. Acts Chapter 7 Stephen’s speech before the council. His martyrdom.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	1	Then the high priest said: Are these things so?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	2	Who said: Ye men, brethren and fathers, hear. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	3	And said to him: Go forth out of thy country and from thy kindred: and come into the land which I shall shew thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	4	Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charan. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	5	And he gave him no inheritance in it: no, not the pace of a foot. But he promised to give it him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	6	And God said to him: That his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and that they should bring them under bondage and treat them evil four hundred years.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	7	And the nation which they shall serve will I judge (said the Lord): and after these things they shall go out and shall serve me in this place.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so he begot Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day: and Isaac begot Jacob: and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	9	And the patriarchs, through envy, sold Joseph into Egypt. And God was with him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	10	And delivered him out of all his tribulations: and he gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharao, the king of Egypt. And he appointed him governor over Egypt and over all his house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	11	Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan, and great tribulation: and our fathers found no food.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	12	But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent our fathers first.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	13	And at the second time, Joseph was known by his brethren: and his kindred was made known to Pharao.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	14	And Joseph sending, called thither Jacob, his father, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	15	So Jacob went down into Egypt. And he died, and our fathers.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	16	And they were translated into Sichem and were laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor, the son of Sichem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	17	And when the time of the promise drew near, which God had promised to Abraham, the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	18	Till another king arose in Egypt, who knew not Joseph.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	19	This same, dealing craftily with our race, afflicted our fathers, that they should expose their children, to the end they might not be kept alive.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	20	At the same time was Moses born: and he was acceptable to God. Who was nourished three months in his father’s house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	21	And when he was exposed, Pharao’s daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	22	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians: and he was mighty in his words and in his deeds.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	24	And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he defended him: and striking the Egyptian, he avenged him who suffered the injury.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	25	And he thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them. But they understood it not.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	26	And the day following, he shewed himself to them when they were at strife and would have reconciled them in peace, saying: Men, ye are brethren. Why hurt you one another?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	27	But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	28	What! Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	29	And Moses fled upon this word: and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begot two sons.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	30	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him, in the desert of mount Sina, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	31	And Moses seeing it wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to view it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	32	I am the God of thy fathers: the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. And Moses being terrified durst not behold.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	33	And the Lord said to him: Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place wherein thou standest is holy ground.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	34	Seeing, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt: and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them. And now come: and I will send thee into Egypt.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	35	This Moses, whom they refused, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge? Him God sent to be prince and redeemer, by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	36	He brought them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the desert, forty years.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	37	This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel: A prophet shall God raise up to you of your own brethren, as myself. Him shall you hear.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	38	This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sina and with our fathers. Who received the words of life to give unto us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	39	Whom our fathers would not obey: but thrust him away and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	40	Saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us. For as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	41	And they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifices to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	42	And God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the books of the prophets: Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me for forty years, in the desert, O house of Israel?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	43	And you took unto you the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Rempham, figures which you made to adore them. And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	44	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as God ordained for them, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the form which he had seen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	45	Which also our fathers receiving, brought in with Jesus, into the possession of the Gentiles: whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David, Jesus.... That is Josue, so called in Greek.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	46	Who found grace before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	47	But Solomon built him a house,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	48	Yet the most High dwelleth not in houses made by hands, as the prophet saith: Dwelleth not in houses, etc.... That is, so as to stand in need of earthly dwellings, or to be contained, or circumscribed by them. Though, otherwise by his immense divinity, he is in our houses; and every where else; and Christ in his humanity dwelt in houses; and is now on our altars.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	49	Heaven is my throne and the earth my footstool. What house will you build me (saith the Lord)? Or what is the place of my resting?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	50	Hath not my hand made all these things?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	51	You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost. As your fathers did, so do you also.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	52	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? And they have slain them who foretold of the coming of the Just One: of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	53	Who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	54	Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart: and they gnashed with their teeth at him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up steadfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. And he said: Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	56	And they, crying out with a loud voice, stopped their ears and with one accord ran violently upon him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	57	And casting him forth without the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	58	And they stoned Stephen, invoking and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	7	59	And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying: Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord. And Saul was consenting to his death. Acts Chapter 8 Philip converts the Samaritans and baptizes the eunuch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	1	And at that time, there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem. And they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	2	And devout men took order for Stephen’s funeral and made great mourning over him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	3	But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house: and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	4	They therefore that were dispersed went about preaching the word of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	5	And Philip, going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	6	And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	7	For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	8	And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	9	There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	10	To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	11	And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	12	But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	13	Then Simon himself believed also and, being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	14	Now, when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	15	Who, when they were come, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	16	For he was not as yet come upon any of them: but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	17	Then they laid their hands upon them: and they received the Holy Ghost. They laid their hands upon them, etc.... The apostles administered the sacrament of confirmation, by imposition of hands, and prayer; and the faithful thereby received the Holy Ghost. Not but they had received the grace of the Holy Ghost at their baptism: yet not that plenitude of grace and those spiritual gifts which they afterwards received from bishops in the sacrament of confirmation, which strengthened them to profess their faith publicly.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	18	And when Simon saw that, by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	19	Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	20	Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee: because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	21	Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	22	Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness: and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	23	For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	24	Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	25	And they indeed, having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem: and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	26	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	27	And rising up, he went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	28	And he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading Isaias the prophet.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	29	And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near and join thyself to this chariot.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	30	And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	31	Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	32	And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	33	In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	34	And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? Of himself, or of some other man?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	35	Then Philip, opening his mouth and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	36	And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is water: What doth hinder me from being baptized?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	37	And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. If thou believest with all thy heart.... The scripture many times mentions only one disposition, as here belief, when others equally necessary are not expressed, viz., a sorrow for sins, a firm hope, and the love of God. Moreover, believing with the whole heart signifies a belief of every thing necessary for salvation.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch. And he baptized him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip: and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	8	40	But Philip was found in Azotus: and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea. Acts Chapter 9 Paul’s conversion and zeal. Peter heals Eneas and raises up Tabitha to life.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	1	And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	2	And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues: that if he found any men and women of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	3	And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that he drew nigh to Damascus. And suddenly a light from heaven shined round about him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	4	And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	5	Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	6	And he, trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	7	And the Lord said to him: Arise and go into the city; and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now the men who went in company with him stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice but seeing no man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	8	And Saul arose from the ground: and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they, leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	9	And he was there three days without sight: and he did neither eat nor drink.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	10	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias, And he said: Behold I am here, Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	11	And the Lord said to him: Arise and go into the street that is called Strait and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	12	(And he saw a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands upon him, that he might receive his sight.)	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	13	But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	14	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	15	And the Lord said to him: Go thy way: for this man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	16	For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	17	And Ananias went his way and entered into the house. And laying his hands upon him, he said: Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest, that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he received his sight. And rising up, he was baptized.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	19	And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples that were at Damascus, for some days.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	20	And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the son of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	21	And all that heard him were astonished and said: Is not this he who persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon this name and came hither for that intent, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	22	But Saul increased much more in strength and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, affirming that this is the Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	23	And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted together to kill him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	24	But their lying in wait was made known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night, that they might kill him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	25	But the disciples, taking him in the night, conveyed him away by the wall, letting him down in a basket.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	26	And when he was come into Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples: and they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	27	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and told them how he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken to him: and how in Damascus he had dealt confidently in the name of Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	28	And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem and dealing confidently in the name of the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	29	He spoke also to the Gentiles and disputed with the Greeks. But they sought to kill him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	30	Which when the brethren had known, they brought him down to Cæsarea and sent him away to Tarsus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	31	Now, the church had peace throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria: and was edified, walking in the fear of the Lord: and was filled with the consolation of the Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	32	And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through, visiting all, came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	33	And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, who was ill of the palsy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	34	And Peter said to him: Eneas, the Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed. And immediately he arose.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him: who were converted to the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	36	And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	37	And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died. Whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	38	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not be slack to come unto them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	39	And Peter rising up went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood about him, weeping and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	40	And they all being put forth, Peter, kneeling down, prayed. And turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes and, seeing Peter, sat up.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	41	And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	42	And it was made known throughout all Joppe. And many believed in the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	9	43	And it came to pass that he abode many days in Joppe, with one Simon a tanner. Acts Chapter 10 Cornelius is received into the church. Peter’s vision.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	1	And there was a certain man in Cæsarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	2	A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to the people and always praying to God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	3	This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him and saying to him: Cornelius.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	4	And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	5	And now send men to Joppe: and call hither one Simon, who is surnamed Peter.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	6	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	7	And when the angel who spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household servants and a soldier who feared the Lord, of them that were under him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	8	To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	9	And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	10	And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat. And as they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	11	And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to the earth:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	12	Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and fowls of the air.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	13	And there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter. Kill and eat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	14	But Peter said: Far be it from me. For I never did eat any thing that is common and unclean.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	15	And the voice spoke to him again the second time: That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	16	And this was done thrice. And presently the vessel was taken up into heaven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	17	Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself what the vision that he had seen should mean, behold the men who were sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon’s house, stood at the gate.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	18	And when they had called, they asked if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, were lodged there.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	19	And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold three men seek thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	20	Arise, therefore: get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	21	Then Peter, going down to the men, said: Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the cause for which you are come?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	22	Who said: Cornelius, a centurion, a just man and one that feareth God, and having good testimony from all the nation of the Jews, received an answer of an holy angel, to send for thee into his house And to hear words of thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	23	Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following, he arose and went with them: and some of the brethren from Joppe accompanied him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	24	And the morrow after, he entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited for them, having called together his kinsmen and special friends.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	25	And it came to pass that when Peter was come in, Cornelius came to meet him and falling at his feet adored.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	26	But Peter lifted him up, saying: Arise: I myself also am a man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	27	And talking with him, he went in and found many that were come together.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	28	And he said to them: you know how abominable it is for a man that is a Jew to keep company or to come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed to me, to call no man common or unclean.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	29	For which cause, making no doubt, I came when I was sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause you have sent for me?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	30	And Cornelius said: Four days ago, unto this hour, I was praying in my house, at the ninth hour and behold a man stood before me in white apparel and said:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	31	Cornelius, thy prayer is heard and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	32	Send therefore to Joppe: and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and thou hast done well in coming. Now, therefore, all we are present in thy sight to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	34	And Peter opening his mouth, said: in very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	35	But in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh justice is acceptable to him. In every nation, etc.... That is to say, not only Jews, but Gentiles also, of what nation soever, are acceptable to God, if they fear him and work justice. But then true faith is always to be presupposed, without which (saith St. Paul, Heb. 11. 6) it is impossible to please God. Beware then of the error of those, who would infer from this passage, that men of all religions may be pleasing to God. For since none but the true religion can be from God, all other religions must be from the father of lies, and therefore highly displeasing to the God of truth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	36	God sent the word to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all).	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	37	You know the word which hath been published through all Judea: for it began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	38	Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	39	And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem: whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	40	Him God raised up the third day and gave him to be made manifest,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	41	Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he arose again from the dead.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	42	And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	43	To him all the prophets give testimony, that by his name all receive remission of sins, who believe in him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	44	While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	45	And the faithful of the circumcision, who came with Peter, were astonished for that the grace of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	46	For they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	47	Then Peter answered: Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, as well as we?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	10	48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then they desired him to tarry with them some days. Acts Chapter 11 Peter defends his having received the Gentiles into the church.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	1	And the apostles and brethren, who were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	3	Saying: Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	4	But Peter began and declared to them the matter in order, saying:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	5	I was in the city of Joppe praying: and I saw in an ecstasy of mind a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. And it came even unto me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	6	Into which looking, I considered and saw fourfooted creatures of the earth and beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	7	And I heard also a voice saying to me: Arise, Peter. Kill and eat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	8	And I said: Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	9	And the voice answered again from heaven: What God hath made clean, do not thou call common.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	10	And this was done three times. And all were taken up again into heaven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	11	And behold, immediately there were three men come to the house wherein I was, sent to me from Cæsarea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	12	And the Spirit said to me that I should go with them, nothing doubting. And these six brethren went with me also: and we entered into the man’s house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	13	And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him: Send to Joppe and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	14	Who shall speak to thee words whereby thou shalt be saved, and all thy house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	15	And when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said: John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	17	If then God gave them the same grace as to us also who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ: who was I, that could withstand God?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	18	Having heard these things, they held their peace and glorified God, saying: God then hath also to the Gentiles given repentance, unto life.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	19	Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose on occasion of Stephen went about as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none, but to the Jews only.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	20	But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were entered into Antioch, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	21	And the hand of he Lord was with them: and a great number believing, were converted to the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	22	And the tidings came to the ears of the church that was at Jerusalem, touching these things: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	23	Who, when he was come and had seen the grace of God, rejoiced. And he exhorted them all with purpose of heart to continue in the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	24	For he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	25	And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul: whom, when he had found, he brought to Antioch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	26	And they conversed there in the church a whole year: and they taught a great multitude, so that at Antioch the disciples were first named Christians.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	27	And in these days there came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	28	And one of them named Agabus, rising up, signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over the whole world, which came to pass under Claudius.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	29	And the disciples, every man according to his ability, purposed to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	11	30	Which also they did, sending it to the ancients, by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. Acts Chapter 12 Herod’s persecution. Peter’s deliverance by an angel. Herod’s punishment.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	1	And at the same time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands, to afflict some of the church.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	2	And he killed James, the brother of John, With the sword.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	3	And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take up Peter also. Now it was in the days of the Azymes. Azymes.... The festival of the unleavened bread, or the pasch, which answers to our Easter.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	4	And when he had apprehended him, he cast him into prison, delivering him to four files of soldiers, to be kept, intending, after the pasch, to bring him forth to the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	5	Peter therefore was kept in prison. But prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	7	And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shined in the room. And he, striking Peter on the side, raised him up, saying: Arise quickly. And the chains fell off from his hands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	8	And the angel said to him: Gird thyself and put on thy sandals. And he did so. And he said to him: Cast thy garment about thee and follow me,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	9	And going out, he followed him. And he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel: but thought he saw a vision.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	10	And passing through the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city which of itself opened to them. And going out, they passed on through one street. And immediately the angel departed from him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	11	And Peter coming to himself, said: Now I know in very deed that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	12	And considering, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	13	And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, whose name was Rhode.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	14	And as soon as she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy: but running in she told that Peter stood before the gate.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	15	But they said to her: Thou art mad. But she affirmed that it was so. Then said they: It is his angel.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	16	But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened, they saw him and were astonished.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	17	But he, beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, told how the Lord had brought him out of prison. And he said: Tell these things to James and to the brethren. And going out, he went into another place.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	18	Now when day was come, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	19	And when Herod had sought for him and found him not, having examined the keepers, he commanded they should be put to death. And going down from Judea to Cæsarea, he abode there.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	20	And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians. But they with one accord came to him: and, having gained Blastus who was the king’s chamberlain, they desired peace, because their countries were nourished by him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	21	And upon a day appointed, Herod being arrayed in kingly apparel, sat in the judgment seat and made an oration to them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	22	And the people made acclamation, saying: It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	23	And forthwith an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the honour to God: and, being eaten up by worms, he gave up the ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	24	But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	12	25	And Barnabas and Saul, returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled their ministry, taking with them John who was surnamed Mark. Acts Chapter 13 Saul and Barnabas are sent forth by the Holy Ghost. They preach in Cyprus and in Antioch of Pisidia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	1	Now there were in the church which was at Antioch prophets and doctors, among whom was Barnabas and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manahen who was the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	2	And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Ghost said to them: Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	3	Then they fasting and praying and imposing their hands upon them, sent them away.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	4	So they, being sent by the Holy Ghost, went to Seleucia: and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	5	And when they were come to Salamina, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also in the ministry.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	6	And when they had gone through the whole island, as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesu:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	7	Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He, sending for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is interpreted) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	9	Then Saul, otherwise Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, looking upon him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	10	Said: O full of all guile and of all deceit, child of the devil, enemy of all justice, thou ceasest not to pervert the right ways of the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	11	And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee: and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell a mist and darkness upon him: and going about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	12	Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done, believed, admiring at the doctrine of the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	13	Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from Paphos, they came to Perge in Pamphylia. And John departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	14	But they, passing through Perge, came to Antioch in Pisidia: and, entering into the Synagogue on the sabbath day, they sat down.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Ye men, brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to make to the people, speak.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	16	Then Paul rising up and with his hand bespeaking silence, said: Ye men of Israel and you that fear God, give ear.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	17	The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt: And with an high arm brought them out from thence:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	18	And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the desert:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	19	And, destroying seven nations in the land of Chanaan, divided their land among them by lot.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	20	As it were, after four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the prophet.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	21	And after that they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	22	And when he had removed him, he raised them up David to be king: to whom giving testimony, he said: I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who shall do all my wills.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	23	Of this man’s seed, God, according to his promise, hath raised up to Israel a Saviour Jesus:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	24	John first preaching, before his coming, the baptism of penance to all the people of Israel.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	25	And when John was fulfilling his course, he said: I am not he whom you think me to be. But behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	26	Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fear God: to you the word of this salvation is sent.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	27	For they that inhabited Jerusalem and the rulers thereof, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, judging him, have fulfilled them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	28	And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of Pilate that they might kill him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	29	And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	30	But God raised him up from the dead the third day.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	31	Who was seen for many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who to this present are his witnesses to the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	32	And we declare unto you that the promise which was made to our fathers,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	33	This same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising up Jesus, as in the second psalm also is written: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	34	And to shew that he raised him up from the dead, not to return now any more to corruption, he said thus: I will give you the holy things of David, faithful. I will give you the holy, etc.... These are the words of the prophet Isaias, 55. 3. According to the Septuagint, the sense is: I will faithfully fulfil the promises I made to David.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	35	And therefore, in another place also, he saith: Thou shalt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	36	For David, when he had served in his generation, according to the will of God, slept: and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	37	But he whom God hath raised from the dead saw no corruption.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	38	Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is preached to you: and from all the things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	39	In him every one that believeth is justified.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	40	Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	41	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, if any man shall tell it you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	42	And as they went out, they desired them that on the next sabbath they would speak unto them these words.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	43	And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews and of the strangers who served God followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	44	But the next sabbath day, the whole city almost came together, to hear the word of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	45	And the Jews, seeing the multitudes, were filled with envy and contradicted those things which were said by Paul, blaspheming.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	46	Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly: To you it behoved us first to speak the word of God: but because you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold we turn to the Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	47	For so the Lord hath commanded us: I have set thee to be the light of the Gentiles: that thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost part of the earth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	48	And the Gentiles hearing it were glad and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to life everlasting believed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole country.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	50	But the Jews stirred up religious and honourable women and the chief men of the city: and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas: and cast them out of their coasts.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	51	But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	13	52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost. Acts Chapter 14 Paul and Barnabas preach in Iconium and Lystra. Paul heals a cripple. They are taken for gods. Paul is stoned. They preach in Derbe and Perge.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	1	And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke that a very great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks did believe.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	3	A long time therefore they abode there, dealing confidently in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	4	And the multitude of the city was divided. And some of them indeed held with the Jews, but some with the apostles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	5	And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to use them contumeliously and to stone them:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	6	They, understanding it, fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the whole country round about: and were there preaching the gospel.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	7	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	8	This same heard Paul speaking. Who looking upon him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	9	Said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	10	And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying: The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	11	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter: but Paul, Mercury: because he was chief speaker.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	12	The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing oxen and garlands before the gate, would have offered sacrifice with the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	13	Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard, rending their clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	14	And saying: Ye men, why do ye these things? We also are mortals, men like unto you, preaching to you to be converted from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	15	Who in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	16	Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing good from heaven, giving rains and fruitful Seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	17	And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people from sacrificing to them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	18	Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium: and, persuading the multitude and stoning Paul, drew him out of the city, thinking him to be dead.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	19	But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and entered into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	20	And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	21	Confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith: and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	22	And when they had ordained to them priests in every church and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	23	And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	24	And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they went down into Attalia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	25	And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been delivered to the grace of God, unto the work which they accomplished.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	26	And when they were come and had assembled the church, they related what great things God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	14	27	And they abode no small time with the disciples. Acts Chapter 15 A dissension about circumcision. The decision and letter of the council of Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	1	And some, coming down from Judea, taught the brethren: That, except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	2	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of the other side should go up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem, about this question.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	3	They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through Phenice and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles. And they caused great joy to all the brethren.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and by the apostles and ancients, declaring how great things God had done with them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	5	But there arose of the sect of the Pharisees some that believed, saying: They must be circumcised and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	6	And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	7	And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know that in former days God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	8	And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	9	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	10	Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	11	But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in like manner as they also.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	12	And all the multitude held their peace: and they heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	14	Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles, a people to his name.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	15	And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	16	After these things I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down: and the ruins thereof I will rebuild. And I will set it up:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	17	That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	18	To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the world.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	19	For which cause I judge that they who from among the Gentiles are converted to God are not to be disquieted:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	20	But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	21	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	22	Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to choose men of their own company and to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	23	Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	24	Forasmuch as we have heard that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we gave no commandment:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	25	It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	26	Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	28	For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay no further burden upon you than these necessary things:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	29	That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication: from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well. From blood, and from things strangled.... The use of these things, though of their own nature indifferent, was here prohibited, to bring the Jews more easily to admit of the society of the Gentiles; and to exercise the latter in obedience. But this prohibition was but temporary, and has long since ceased to oblige; more especially in the western churches.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	30	They therefore, being dismissed, went down to Antioch and, gathering together the multitude, delivered the epistle.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	31	Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	32	But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, with many words comforted the brethren and confirmed them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	33	And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by the brethren unto them that had sent them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	34	But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there: and Judas alone departed to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	35	And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	36	And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas: Let us return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they do.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	37	And Barnabas would have taken with them John also, that was surnamed Mark.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	38	But Paul desired that he (as having departed from them out of Pamphylia and not gone with them to the work) might not be received.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	39	And there arose a dissension so that they departed one from another. And Barnabas indeed, taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	40	But Paul, choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by the brethren to the grace of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	15	41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients. Acts Chapter 16 Paul visits the churches. He is called to preach in Macedonia. He is scourged at Philippi.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	1	And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, there was a certain disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman that believed: but his father was a Gentile.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	2	To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	3	Him Paul would have to go along with him: and taking him, he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places. For they all knew that his father was a Gentile.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	4	And as they passed through the cities, they delivered unto them the decrees for to keep, that were decreed by the apostles and ancients who were at Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	5	And the churches were confirmed in faith and increased in number daily.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	6	And when they had passed through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	7	And when they were come into Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	8	And when they had passed through Mysia, they went down to Troas.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	9	And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night, which was a man of Macedonia standing and beseeching him and saying: Pass over into Macedonia and help us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	10	And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia: being assured that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	11	And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the day following to Neapolis.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	12	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city some days conferring together.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	13	And upon the Sabbath day, we went forth without the gate by a river side, where it seemed that there was prayer: and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, did hear: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to those things which were said by Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	15	And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl having a pythonical spirit met us, who brought to her masters much gain by divining. A pythonical spirit.... That is, a spirit pretending to divine, and tell fortunes.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	17	This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the Most High God, who preach unto you the way of salvation.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	18	And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out from her. And he went out the same hour.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	19	But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the market place to the rulers.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	20	And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These men disturb our city, being Jews:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	21	And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	22	And the people ran together against them: and the magistrates, rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	24	Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	25	And at midnight, Paul and Silas, praying, praised God. And they that were in prison heard them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and the bands of all were loosed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	27	And the keeper of the prison, awakening out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself no harm, for we all are here.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	29	Then calling for a light, he went in: and trembling, fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	30	And bringing them out, he said: Masters, what must I do, that I may be saved?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	31	But they said: believe in the Lord Jesus: and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	32	And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	33	And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes: and himself was baptized, and all his house immediately.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	34	And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table for them: and rejoiced with all his house, believing God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	35	And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying: Let those men go.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	36	And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart. And go in peace.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	37	But Paul said to them: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison. And now do they thrust us out privately? Not so: but let them come.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	38	And let us out themselves. And the serjeants told these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid: hearing that they were Romans.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	39	And coming, they besought them: and bringing them out, they desired them to depart out of the city.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	16	40	And they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia: and having seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed. Acts Chapter 17 Paul preaches to the Thessalonians and Bereans. His discourse to the Athenians.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	1	And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	2	And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them. And for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	3	Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	4	And some of them believed and were associated to Paul and Silas: and of those that served God and of the Gentiles a great multitude: and of noble women not a few.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	5	But the Jews, moved with envy and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar: and besetting Jason’s house, sought to bring them out unto the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	6	And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar are come hither also: City. Urbem.... In the Greek, the world.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	7	Whom Jason hath received. And these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	8	And they stirred up the people: and the rulers of the city, hearing these things,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	9	And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	10	But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	11	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so. More noble.... The Jews of Berea are justly commended, for their eagerly embracing the truth, and searching the scriptures, to find out the texts alleged by the apostle: which was a far more generous proceeding than that of their countrymen at Thessalonica, who persecuted the preachers of the gospel, without examining the grounds they alleged for what they taught.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	12	And many indeed of them believed: and of honourable women that were Gentiles and of men, not a few.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	13	And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	15	And they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	16	Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	17	He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews and with them that served God: and in the market place, every day, with them that were there.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	18	And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him. And some said: What is it that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods. Because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	19	And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	20	For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	21	(Now all the Athenians and strangers that were there employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	22	But Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	23	For passing by and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the Unknown God. What therefore you worship without knowing it, that I preach to you:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	24	God, who made the world and all things therein, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Dwelleth not in temples.... God is not contained in temples; so as to need them for his dwelling, or any other uses, as the heathens imagined. Yet by his omnipresence, he is both there and everywhere.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	25	Neither is he served with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing: seeing it is he who giveth to all life and breath and all things:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	26	And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times and the limits of their habitation.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	27	That they should seek God, if haply they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	28	For in him we live and move and are: as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	29	Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold or silver or stone, the graving of art and device of man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	30	And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men that all should every where do penance.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	31	Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed: giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	32	And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked. But others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	33	So Paul went out from among them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	17	34	But certain men, adhering to him, did believe: among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. Acts Chapter 18 Paul founds the church of Corinth and preaches at Ephesus and in other places. Apollo goes to Corinth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	1	After these things, departing from Athens, he came to Corinth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	2	And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), he came to them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	3	And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and wrought. (Now they were tentmakers by trade.)	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus. And he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	5	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	6	But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his garments and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads: I am clean. From henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	7	And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain man, named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	8	And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house. And many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	9	And the Lord said to Paul in the night, by a vision: Do not fear, but speak. And hold not thy peace,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	10	Because I am with thee and no man shall set upon thee, to hurt thee. For I have much people in this city.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	11	And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	12	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	13	Saying: This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	14	And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were some matter of injustice or an heinous deed, O Jews, I should with reason bear with you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	15	But if they be questions of word and names and of your law, look you to it. I will not be judge of such things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	16	And he drove them from the judgment seat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	17	And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	18	But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shorn his head in Cenchrae. For he had a vow.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	19	And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself, entering into the synagogue, disputed with the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	20	And when they desired him that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	21	But taking his leave and saying: I will return to you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	22	And going down to Cæsarea, he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church: and so came down to Antioch.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	23	And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	24	Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in spirit, spoke and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	26	This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them and expounded to him the way of the Lord more diligently.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	27	And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	18	28	For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. Acts Chapter 19 Paul establishes the church at Ephesus. The tumult of the silversmiths.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	1	And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	2	And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	3	And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John’s baptism.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	4	Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance saying: That they should believe in him, who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	5	Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	6	And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them: and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	7	And all the men were about twelve.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	8	And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	9	But when some were hardened and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	10	And this continued for the space of two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	11	And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	12	So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons: and the diseases departed from them: and the wicked spirits went out of them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	13	Now some also of the Jewish exorcists, who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	14	And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	15	But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know: and Paul I know. But who are you?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	16	And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	17	And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt a Ephesus. And fear fell on them all: and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	18	And many of them that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	19	And many of them who had followed curious arts brought together their books and burnt them before all. And, counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	20	So mightily grew the word of God and was confirmed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	21	And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	22	And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	23	Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	25	Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	26	And you see and hear that this Paul, by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: they are not gods which are made by hands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing! Yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	28	Having heard these things, they were full of anger and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	29	And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	31	And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	32	Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused: and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	33	And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	34	But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two, hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	35	And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiter’s offspring?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	36	For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	37	For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	38	But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open: and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	39	And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	19	40	For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. Acts Chapter 20 Paul passes through Macedonia and Greece. He raises a dead man to life at Troas. His discourse to the clergy of Ephesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	1	And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling to him the disciples and exhorting them, took his leave and set forward to go into Macedonia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	2	And when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	3	Where, when he had spent three months, the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria. So he took a resolution to return through Macedonia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	4	And there accompanied him Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, of Berea: and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy: and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	5	These, going before, stayed for us at Troas.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	6	But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the azymes and came to them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	7	And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, being to depart on the morrow. And he continued his speech until midnight. And on the first day of the week.... Here St. Chrysostom and many other interpreters of the scripture explain, that the Christians even at this time, must have changed the sabbath into the first day of the week, (the Lord’s day,) as all Christians now keep it. This change was undoubtedly made by the authority of the church; hence the exercise of the power, which Christ had given to her: for he is Lord of the sabbath.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	8	And there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where we were assembled.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	9	And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting on the window, being oppressed with a deep sleep (as Paul was long preaching), by occasion of his sleep fell from the third loft down and was taken up dead.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	10	To whom, when Paul had gone down, he laid himself upon him and, embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his soul is in him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	11	Then going up and breaking bread and tasting and having talked a long time to them, until daylight, so he departed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	12	And they brought the youth alive and were not a little comforted.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	13	But we going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul. For so he had appointed, himself purposing to travel by land.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	14	And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	15	And sailing thence, the day following we came over against Chios: and the next day we arrived at Samos: and the day following we came to Miletus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, lest he should be stayed any time in Asia. For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to keep the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	17	And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the ancients of the church.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	18	And when they were come to him and were together, he said to them: You know from the first day that I came into Asia, in what manner I have been with you, for all the time.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	19	Serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and temptations which befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	20	How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	21	Testifying both to Jews and Gentiles penance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	22	And now, behold, being bound in the spirit, I go to Jerusalem: not knowing the things which shall befall me there:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	23	Save that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to me, saying: That bands and afflictions wait for me at Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	24	But I fear none of these things, neither do I count my life more precious than myself, so that I may consummate my course and the ministry of the word which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	25	And now behold, I know that all you, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	26	Wherefore I take you to witness this day that I am clear from the blood of all men.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	27	For I have not spared to declare unto you all, the counsel of God.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	28	Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops, to rule the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	29	I know that after my departure ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	30	And of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	31	Therefore watch, keeping in memory that for three years I ceased not with tears to admonish every one of you, night and day.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	32	And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, who is able to build up and to give an inheritance among all the sanctified.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	33	I have not coveted any man’s silver, gold or apparel, as	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	34	You yourselves know. For such things as were needful for me and them that are with me, these hands have furnished.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	35	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	36	And when he had said these things, kneeling down, he prayed with them all.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	37	And there was much weeping among them all. And falling on the neck of Paul, they kissed him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	20	38	Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship. Acts Chapter 21 Paul goes up to Jerusalem. He is apprehended by the Jews in the temple.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	1	And when it came to pass that, being parted from them, we set sail, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes: and from thence to Patara.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	2	And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice, we went aboard and set forth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	3	And when we had discovered Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed into Syria, and came to Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul, through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	5	And the days being expired, departing we went forward, they all bringing us on our way, with their wives and children, till we were out of the city. And we kneeled down on the shore: and we prayed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	6	And when we had bid one another farewell, we took ship. And they returned home.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	7	But we, having finished the voyage by sea, from Tyre came down to Ptolemais: and saluting the brethren, we abode one day with them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	8	And the next day departing, we came to Cæsarea. And entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him. The evangelist.... That is, the preacher of the gospel; the same that before converted the Samaritans, and baptized the eunuch, chap. 8., being one of the first seven deacons.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	9	And he had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	10	And as we tarried there for some days, there came from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	11	Who, when he was come to us, took Paul’s girdle: and binding his own feet and hands, he said: Thus saith the Holy Ghost: The man whose girdle this is, the Jews shall bind in this manner in Jerusalem and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	12	Which when we had heard, both we and they that were of that place desired him that he would not go up to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	13	Then Paul answered and said: What do you mean, weeping and afflicting my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but to die also in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	14	And when we could not persuade him, we ceased, saying: The will of the Lord be done.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	15	And after those days, being prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	16	And there went also with us some of the disciples from Cæsarea, bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	18	And the day following, Paul went in with us unto James: and all the ancients were assembled.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	19	Whom when he had saluted, he related particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	20	But they hearing it, glorified God and said to him: Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews that have believed: and they are all zealous for the law.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	21	Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews, who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses: saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor walk according to the custom.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	22	What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	23	Do therefore this that we say to thee. We have four men, who have a vow on them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	24	Take these and sanctify thyself with them: and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads. And all will know that the things which they have heard of thee are false: but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law. Keeping the law.... The law, though now no longer obligatory, was for a time observed by the Christian Jews: to bury, as it were, the synagogue with honour.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	25	But, as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has been offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	26	Then Paul took the men and, the next day being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one of them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	27	But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and laid hands upon him, crying out:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	28	Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place; and moreover hath brought in Gentiles into the temple and hath violated this holy place.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	29	(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him. whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	30	And the whole city was in an uproar: and the people ran together. And taking Paul, they drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	31	And as they went about to kill him, it was told the tribune of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	32	Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions, ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	33	Then the tribune, coming near, took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains: and demanded who he was and what he had done.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude. And when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	35	And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying: Away with him!	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	37	And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith to the tribune: May I speak something to thee? Who said: Canst thou speak Greek?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	38	Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days didst raise a tumult and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were murderers?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	39	But Paul said to him: I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	21	40	And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great silence being made, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying: Acts Chapter 22 Paul declares to the people the history of his conversion. He escapes scourging by claiming the privilege of a Roman citizen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	1	Men, brethren and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give unto you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	2	(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence.)	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	3	And he saith: I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous for the law, as also all you are this day:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	4	Who persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	5	As the high priest doth bear me witness and all the ancients. From whom also receiving letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus, that I might bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	6	And it came to pass, as I was going and drawing nigh to Damascus, at mid-day, that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a great light:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	7	And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	8	And I answered: Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	9	And they that were with me saw indeed the light: but they heard not the voice of him that spoke with me. Heard not the voice.... That is, they distinguished not the words; though they heard the voice. Acts 9. 7.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	10	And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	11	And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light, being led by the hand by my companions, I came to Damascus,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	12	And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having testimony of all the Jews who dwelt there,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	13	Coming to me and standing by me, said to me: Brother Saul, look up. And I, the same hour, looked upon him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	14	But he said: The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that thou shouldst know his will and see the Just One and shouldst hear the voice from his mouth. Just One.... Our Saviour, who appeared to St. Paul, Acts 9. 17.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	15	For thou shalt be his witness to all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	16	And now why tarriest thou? Rise up and be baptized and wash away thy sins, invoking his name.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	17	And it came to pass, when I was come again to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	18	And saw him saying unto me: Make haste and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	19	And I said: Lord, they know that I cast into prison and beat in every synagogue them that believed in thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	20	And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I stood by and consented: and kept the garments of them that killed him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	21	And he said to me: Go, for unto the Gentiles afar off will I send thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	22	And they heard him until this word and then lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such an one from the earth. For it is not fit that he should live.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	23	And as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust into the air,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	24	The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and that he should be scourged and tortured: to know for what cause they did so cry out against him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	25	And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the centurion that stood by him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	26	Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune and told him, saying: What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	27	And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me. Art thou a Roman? But he said: Yea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	28	And the tribune answered: I obtained the being free of this city with a great sum. And Paul said: But I was born so.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	29	Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to torture him. The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman citizen and because he had bound him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	22	30	But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently for what cause he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him and commanded the priests to come together and all the council: and, bringing forth Paul, he set him before them. Acts Chapter 23 Paul stands before the council. The Jews conspire his death. He is sent away to Cesarea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	1	And Paul, looking upon the council, said: Men, brethren, I have conversed with all good conscience before God until this present day.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	2	And the high priest, Ananias, commanded them that stood by him to strike him on the mouth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	3	Then Paul said to him: God shall strike thee, thou whited wall. For, sittest thou to judge me according to the law and, contrary to the law, commandest me to be struck?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	4	And they that stood by said: Dost thou revile the high priest of God?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	5	And Paul said: I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest. For it is written: Thou shalt not speak evil of the prince of thy people.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	6	And Paul, knowing that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And the multitude was divided.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	9	And there arose a great cry. And some of the Pharisees rising up, strove, saying: We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	10	And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	11	And the night following, the Lord standing by him, said: Be constant: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	12	And when day was come, some of the Jews gathered together and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they killed Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	13	And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	14	Who came to the chief priests and the ancients and said: We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we have slain Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	15	Now therefore do you with the council signify to the tribune, that he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to know something more certain touching him. And we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	16	Which when Paul’s sister’s son had heard, of their lying in wait, he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	17	And Paul, calling to him one of the centurions, said: Bring this young man to the tribune: for he hath some thing to tell him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	18	And he, taking him, brought him to the tribune and said: Paul, the prisoner, desired me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath some thing to say to thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	19	And the tribune, taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately and asked him: What is it that thou hast to tell me?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	20	And he said: The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldst bring forth Paul to-morrow into the council, as if they meant to inquire some thing more certain touching him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	21	But do not thou give credit to them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves by oath neither to eat nor to drink, till they have killed him. And they are now ready, looking for a promise from thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	22	The tribune therefore dismissed the young man, charging him that he should tell no man that he had made known these things unto him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	23	Then having called two centurions, he said to them: Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Cæsarea: and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, for the third hour of the night.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	24	And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on and bring him safe to Felix the governor.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	25	(For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by force and kill him: and he should afterwards be slandered, as if he was to take money.) And he wrote a letter after this manner:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	26	Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	27	This man, being taken by the Jews and ready to be killed by them, I rescued, coming in with an army, understanding that he is a Roman.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	28	And meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him, I brought him forth into their council.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	29	Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law; but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	30	And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him, I sent him to thee, signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	31	Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded them, taking Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	32	And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	33	Who, when they were come to Cæsarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, did also present Paul before him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	34	And when he had read it and had asked of what province he was and understood that he was of Cilicia:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	23	35	I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall. Acts Chapter 24 Paul defends his innocence before Felix the governor. He preaches the faith to him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	1	And after five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with some ancients and one Tertullus, an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	2	And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas, through thee we live in much peace and many things are rectified by thy providence,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	3	We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	4	But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in a few words.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	5	We have found this to be a pestilent man and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world: and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	6	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	7	But Lysias the tribune, coming upon us with great violence, took him away out of our hands;	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	8	Commanding his accusers to come to thee. Of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	9	And the Jews also added and said that these things were so.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	10	Then Paul answered (the governor making a sign to him to speak): Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	11	For thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	12	And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or causing any concourse of the people: neither in the synagogues, nor in the city.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	13	Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	14	But this I confess to thee that according to the way which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	15	Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	16	And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence, towards God and towards men.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	17	Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings and vows.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	18	In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude nor with tumult.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	19	But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee and to accuse, if they had anything against me:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	20	Or let these men themselves say if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	21	Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them: Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	22	And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	23	And he commanded a centurion to keep him: and that he should be easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	24	And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul and heard of him the faith that is in Christ Jesus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	25	And as he treated of justice and chastity and of the judgment to come, Felix, being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	26	Hoping also withal that money should be given him by Paul: for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	24	27	But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. Acts Chapter 25 Paul appeals to Caesar. King Agrippa desires to hear him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Cæsarea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	2	And the chief priests and principal men of the Jews went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	3	Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	4	But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Cæsarea: and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	5	Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	6	And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cæsarea. And the next day, he sat in the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	7	Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from Jerusalem, objecting many and grievious causes, which they could not prove:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	8	Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	9	But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	10	Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	11	For if I have injured them or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	12	Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	13	And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea, to salute Festus.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	14	And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of Paul, saying: A certain man was left prisoner by Felix.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	15	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the ancients of the Jews came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	16	To whom I answered: it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	17	When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	18	Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of this which I thought ill of:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	19	But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	20	I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these things.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	21	But Paul, appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	22	And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	23	And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp and had entered into the hall of audience with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment, Paul was brought forth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	24	And Festus saith: King Agrippa and all ye men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	25	Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	26	Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. For which cause, I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, examination being made, I may have what to write.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	25	27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify the things laid to his charge. Acts Chapter 26 Paul gives an account to Agrippa of his life, conversion and calling.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	1	Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	2	I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	3	Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions, that are among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	4	And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	5	Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived, a Pharisee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	6	And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	7	Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should raise the dead?	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	9	And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	10	Which also I did at Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	11	And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	12	Whereupon, when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	13	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that were in company with me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	14	And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	15	And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	16	But rise up and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister and a witness of those things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	17	Delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which now I send thee:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	18	To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	20	But to them first that are at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	21	For this cause, the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	22	But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	23	That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	24	As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	25	And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	26	For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	27	Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	28	And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	29	And Paul said: I would to God that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	30	And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	31	And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	26	32	And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar. Acts Chapter 27 Paul is shipped for Rome. His voyage and shipwreck.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	1	And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	2	Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	3	And the day following, we came to Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of himself.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	5	And sailing over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	6	And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	7	And when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	8	And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	9	And when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	10	Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	11	But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	12	And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the south-west and north-west.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	13	And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	14	But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	15	And when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	16	And running under a certain island that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	17	Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard and so were driven.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	18	And we, being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they lightened the ship.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	19	And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	20	And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	21	And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete and have gained this harm and loss.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but only of the ship.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	23	For an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	24	Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	26	And we must come unto a certain island.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	27	But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	28	Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms: and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	29	Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern: and wished for the day.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	30	But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	33	And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and continued fasting, taking nothing.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	34	Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat for your health’s sake: for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	35	And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all. And when he had broken it, he began to eat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	36	Then were they all of better cheer: and they also took some meat.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	39	And when it was day, they knew not the land. But they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands. And hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	41	And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground. And the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	42	And the soldiers’ counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out should escape.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done. And he commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and save themselves and get to land.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	27	44	And the rest, some they carried on boards and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass that every soul got safe to land. Acts Chapter 28 Paul, after three months’ stay in Melita, continues his voyage and arrives at Rome. His conference there with the Jews.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	1	And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	2	For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	3	And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	4	And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	5	And he indeed, shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	6	But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	7	Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island, named Publius: who, receiving us for three days, entertained us courteously.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	8	And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in. And when he had prayed and laid his hands on him, he healed him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	9	Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came and were healed.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	10	Who also honoured us with many honours: and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were necessary.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	11	And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	12	And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there three days.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	13	From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli:	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	14	Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days. And so we went to Rome.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	15	And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns. Whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	16	And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	17	And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	18	Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	19	But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar: not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	20	For this cause therefore I desired to see you and to speak to you. Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	21	But they said to him: We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea: neither did any of the brethren that came hither relate or speak any evil of thee.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that it is every where contradicted.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him unto his lodgings. To whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	24	And some believed the things that were said: but some believed not.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, Paul speaking this one word: Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by Isaias the prophet,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	26	Saying: Go to this people and say to them: With the ear you shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	27	For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have they heard heavily and their eyes they have shut, lest perhaps they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted: and I should heal them.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	28	Be it known therefore to you that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles: and they will hear it.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	29	And when he had said these things, the Jews went out from him, having much reasoning among themselves.	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	30	And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging: and he received all that came in to him,	4
THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES	28	31	Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without prohibition.	4
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	1	The Ancient, to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	2	Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well, as thy soul doth prosperously.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	3	I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	4	I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk in truth. No greater grace.... that is nothing that gives me greater joy and satisfaction.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	5	Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the brethren: and that for strangers,	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	6	Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church. Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God:	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	7	Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles. Taking nothing of the Gentiles.... These ministers of the gospel are commended by St. John, who took nothing from the Gentiles, lest they should seem to preach in order to get money by it.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such: that we may be fellow helpers of the truth.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	9	I had written perhaps to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	10	For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works which he doth, with malicious words prating against us. And as if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church. Diotrephes who loveth.... This man seemeth to be in power, but not a friend to the faithful; therefore this part of the letter might be an admonition to him from the apostle.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	11	Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil: but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: he that doth evil hath not seen God.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	12	To Demetrius, testimony is given by all, and by the truth itself: yea and we also give testimony. And thou knowest that our testimony is true.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	13	I had many things to write unto thee: but I would not by ink and pen write to thee.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	14	But I hope speedily to see thee: and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JUDE St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and brother to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles were then living, except St. John. He inveighs against the heresies and wicked practices of the Simonians, Nicolaites, and Gnostics, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes, He exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics. Jude Chapter 1 He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	1	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James: to them that are beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	2	Mercy unto you and peace: and charity be fulfilled.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	3	Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	4	For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long ago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	5	I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	6	And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day. Principality.... That is, the state in which they were first created, their original dignity.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	7	As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	8	In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise dominion and blaspheme majesty. Blaspheme majesty.... Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even utter blasphemies against the divine majesty.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	9	When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee. Contended about the body, etc.... This contention, which is no where else mentioned in holy writ, was originally known by revelation, and transmitted by tradition. It is thought the occasion of it was, that the devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner, as to be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours. Command thee.... or rebuke thee.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	10	But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	11	Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have perished in the contradiction of Core. Gone in the way, etc.... Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam, by putting a scandal before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	12	These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by winds: trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion: wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	14	Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints: Prophesied.... This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that is since lost.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	15	To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for all the works of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly: and for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	16	These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own desires: and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring persons, for gain’s sake.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	17	But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful, etc.... He now exhorts the faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had heard from the apostles, who had also foretold that in aftertimes (lit. in the last time) there should be false teachers, scoffing and ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to their passions and lusts; who separate themselves from the Catholic communion by heresies and schisms. Sensual men.... carried away and enslaved by the pleasures of the senses.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	18	Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers, walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	19	These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not the Spirit.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	20	But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting. Building yourselves upon your most holy faith.... Raising by your actions, a spiritual building, founded, 1st, upon faith; 2d, on the love of God; 3d, upon hope, whilst you are waiting for the mercies of God, and the reward of eternal life; 4th, joined with the great duty of prayer.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	22	And some indeed reprove, being judged:	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	23	But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal. And some indeed reprove being judged.... He gives them another instruction to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour, where they will meet with three sorts of persons: 1st, With persons obstinate in their errors and sins; these may be said to be already judged and condemned; they are to be sharply reprehended, reproved, and if possible convinced of their error. 2d, As to others you must endeavour to save them, by pulling them, as it were, out of the fire, from the ruin they stand in great danger of. 3d, You must have mercy on others in fear, when you see them through ignorance of frailty, in danger of being drawn into the snares of these heretics; with these you must deal more gently and mildly, with a charitable compassion, hating always, and teaching others to hate the carnal garment which is spotted, their sensual and corrupt manners, that defile both the soul and body.	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	24	Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:	5
THE THIRD EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	25	To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen. Now to him, etc.... St. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of praising God, and praying to the only God our Saviour, which may either signify God the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the three persons, who are equally the cause of Christ’s incarnation, and man’s salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, being God from eternity, took upon him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer.	5
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, elect,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	2	According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	4	Unto an inheritance, incorruptible, and undefiled and that cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	5	Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	6	Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	7	That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	8	Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now though you see him not, you believe and, believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	11	Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ and the glories that should follow.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	12	To whom it was revealed that, not to themselves but to you, they ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you: the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	13	Wherefore, having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	14	As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires of your ignorance,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	15	But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all manner of conversation holy:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	16	Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	17	And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to every one’s work: converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	18	Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	20	Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the last times for you:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	21	Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the dead and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	22	Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love, from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	24	For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel hath been preached unto you. 1 Peter Chapter 2 We are to lay aside all guile and go to Christ the living stone, and, as being now his people, walk worthily of him, with submission to superiors and patience under sufferings.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	1	Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations and envies and all detractions,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	2	As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	3	If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	4	Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen and made honourable by God:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	5	Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	6	Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him shall not be confounded.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	7	To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	8	And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	9	But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	10	Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy: but now have obtained mercy.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	12	Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	13	Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	14	Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of the good.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	15	For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	16	As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	19	For this is thankworthy: if, for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	20	For what glory is it, if, committing sin and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently: this is thankworthy before God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	21	For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	23	Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not, but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	24	Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	25	For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. 1 Peter Chapter 3 How wives are to behave to their husbands. What ornaments they are to seek. Exhortations to divers Virtues.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	1	In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	2	Considering your chaste conversation with fear.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	3	Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	4	But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	5	For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	6	As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well and not fearing any disturbance.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	7	Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	8	And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	10	For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	11	Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace and pursue it:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	12	Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	13	And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	14	But if also you suffer any thing for justice’ sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	15	But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	16	But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	17	For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer than doing ill.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	18	Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	19	In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison: Spirits that were in prison.... See here a proof of a third place, or middle state of souls: for these spirits in prison, to whom Christ went to preach, after his death, were not in heaven; nor yet in the hell of the damned: because heaven is no prison: and Christ did not go to preach to the damned.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	20	Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	21	Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Whereunto baptism, etc.... Baptism is said to be of the like form with the water by which Noe was saved, because the one was a figure of the other. Not the putting away, etc.... As much as to say, that baptism has not its efficacy, in order to salvation, from its washing away any bodily filth or dirt; but from its purging the conscience from sin, when accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party, to answer the interrogations made at that time, with relation to faith, the renouncing of Satan with all his works; and the obedience to God’s commandments.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	22	Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him. 1 Peter Chapter 4 Exhortations to cease from sin, to mutual charity, to do all for the glory of God, to be willing to suffer for Christ.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	1	Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sins:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	2	That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after the desires of men but according to the will of God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	3	For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the same confusion of riotousness: speaking evil of you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	5	Who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	6	For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: That they might be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh: but may live according to God, in the Spirit.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	7	But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore and watch in prayers.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	8	But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	9	Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	10	As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	11	If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any minister, let him do it, as of the power which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	12	Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you: as if some new thing happened to you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	13	But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	14	If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory and power of God, and that which is his Spirit resteth upon you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a railer or a coveter of other men’s things.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	16	But, if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed: but let him glorify God in that name.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	17	For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if at first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	18	And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Scarcely.... That is, not without much labour and difficulty; and because of the dangers which constantly surround, the temptations of the world, of the devil, and of our own corrupt nature.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	4	19	Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator. 1 Peter Chapter 5 He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and recommends to all humility and watchfulness.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	1	The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre’s sake but voluntarily:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	3	Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	4	And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	5	In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	6	Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	7	Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	8	Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	9	Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls, your brethren who are in the world.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you and confirm you and establish you.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	11	To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	12	By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	13	The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you. And so doth my son, Mark.	6
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	5	14	Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.	6
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	1	James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	2	My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations: Into divers temptations.... The word temptation, in this epistle, is sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions, as in this place: at other times, it is to be understood, tempting, enticing, or drawing others into sin.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	3	Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	4	And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	5	But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	7	Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	8	A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	9	But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	10	And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	11	For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished. So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love him.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	13	Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	14	But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	15	Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	16	Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	17	Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	18	For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature. Some beginning.... That is, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	19	You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	20	For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	21	Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	22	But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	23	For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	24	For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of man he was.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	25	But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	26	And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	1	27	Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world. James Chapter 2 Against respect of persons. The danger of transgressing one point of the law. Faith is dead without works.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, with respect of persons. With respect of persons.... The meaning is, that in matters relating to faith, the administering of the sacraments, and other spiritual functions in God’s church, there should be no respect of persons; but that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the rich. See Deut. 1.17.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	2	For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire:	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	3	And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel and shall say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or: Sit under my footstool:	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	4	Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	5	Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	6	But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	8	If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	9	But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	10	And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. Guilty of all; ... That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such a manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him to salvation; for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great and general commandment of charity, even by one mortal sin. For all the precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law, and as it were a chain of precepts, where, by breaking one link of this chain, the whole chain is broken, or the integrity of the law consisting of a collection of precepts. A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence against any one precept, incurs eternal punishment; yet the punishment in hell shall be greater for those who have been greater sinners, as a greater reward shall be for those in heaven who have lived with greater sanctity and perfection.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	11	For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	12	So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	13	For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	14	What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	15	And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	16	And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	17	So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	18	But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	22	Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works faith was made perfect?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	24	Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	25	And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	2	26	For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works is dead. James Chapter 3 Of the evils of the tongue. Of the difference between the earthly and heavenly wisdom.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	1	Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	2	For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	3	For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us: and we turn about their whole body.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	4	Behold also ships, whereas they are great and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	5	Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	7	For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the rest is tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	8	But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	9	By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men who are made after the likeness of God.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes? Or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	14	But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	15	For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	16	For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and every evil work.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	3	18	And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace. James Chapter 4 The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends to this world. Admonitions against pride, detraction and the like.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	1	From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	2	You covet, and have not: you kill and envy and cannot obtain. You contend and war, and you have not: because you ask not.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	3	You ask and receive not: because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your concupiscences.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	4	Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world becometh an enemy of God.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	5	Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	6	But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	7	Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil: and he will fly from you.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	8	Draw nigh to God: and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	9	Be afflicted and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into sorrow.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	10	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord: and he will exalt you.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	11	Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	12	There is one lawgiver and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	13	But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year and will traffic and make our gain.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	14	Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	15	For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and, If we shall live, we will do this or that.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	16	But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	4	17	To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is sin. James Chapter 5 A woe to the rich that oppress the poor. Exhortations to patience and to avoid swearing. Of the anointing the sick, confession of sins and fervour in prayer.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	1	Go to now, ye rich men: weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	2	Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	4	Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	5	You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the Just One: and he resisted you not.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	7	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	8	Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	9	Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	10	Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	11	Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be: Yea, Yea: No, No: that you fall not under judgment.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	13	Is any of you sad? Let him pray: Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	14	Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. Let him bring in, etc.... See here a plain warrant of scripture for the sacrament of extreme unction, that any controversy against its institution would be against the express words of the sacred text in the plainest terms.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	16	Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much. Confess your sins one to another.... That is, to the priests of the church, whom (ver.14) he had ordered to be called for, and brought in to the sick; moreover, to confess to persons who had no power to forgive sins, would be useless. Hence the precept here means, that we must confess to men whom God hath appointed, and who, by their ordination and jurisdiction, have received the power of remitting sins in his name.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	17	Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth. And it rained not for three years and six months.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	18	And he prayed again. And the heaven gave rain: and the earth brought forth her fruit.	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	19	My brethren, if any of you err from the truth and one convert him:	7
THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES THE APOSTLE	5	20	He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.	7
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	2	According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	3	It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	4	That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	5	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth. Of the course of Abia.... that is, of the rank of Abia, which word in the Greek is commonly put for the employment of one day: but here for the functions of a whole week. For, by the appointment of David, 1 Par. 24., the descendants from Aaron were divided into twenty-four families, of which the eighth was Abia, from whom descended this Zachary, who at this time was in the week of his priestly functions.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	6	And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	7	And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren: and they both were well advanced in years.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	8	And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	9	According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	10	And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	11	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	12	And Zachary seeing him, was troubled: and fear fell upon him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	13	But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard: and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son. And thou shalt call his name John.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness: and many shall rejoice in his nativity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	15	For he shall be great before the Lord and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	16	And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias: that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	18	And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	19	And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good tidings.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	20	And behold, thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass: because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	21	And the people were waiting for Zachary: and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	22	And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	23	And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	24	And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	26	And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: and the virgin’s name was Mary.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	28	And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	29	Who having heard, was troubled at his saying and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	30	And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	31	Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	32	He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	33	And of his kingdom there shall be no end.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	34	And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	35	And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	36	And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	37	Because no word shall be impossible with God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	38	And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	39	And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	40	And she entered into the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	41	And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	43	And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	44	For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	45	And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	46	And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	48	Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Shall call me blessed.... These words are a prediction of that honour which the church in all ages should pay to the Blessed Virgin. Let Protestants examine whether they are any way concerned in this prophecy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	49	Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me: and holy is his name.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	50	And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	51	He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	52	He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	53	He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	54	He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	55	As he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham and to his seed for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months. And she returned to her own house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	57	Now Elizabeth’s full time of being delivered was come: and she brought forth a son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	58	And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her: and they congratulated with her.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	59	And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they called him by his father’s name Zachary.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	60	And his mother answering, said: Not so. But he shall be called John.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	61	And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	62	And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	63	And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	64	And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed: and he spoke, blessing God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	65	And fear came upon all their neighbours: and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	66	And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	67	And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost. And he prophesied, saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	69	And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant. Horn of salvation.... That is, A powerful salvation, as Dr. Witham translates it. For in the Scripture, by horn is generally understood strength and power.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	70	As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	71	Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	72	To perform mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy testament.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	73	The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	74	That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	75	In holiness and justice before him, all our days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	76	And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt, go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their sins.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	78	Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on high hath visited us: The Orient.... It is one of the titles of the Messias, the true light of the world, and the sun of justice.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	79	To enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	80	And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit: and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel. Luke Chapter 2 The birth of Christ. His presentation in the temple. Simeon’s prophecy. Christ at twelve years of age, is found amongst the doctors.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	1	And it came to pass that in those days there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be enrolled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	2	This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	3	And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and family of David.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	5	To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	6	And it came to pass that when they were there, her days were accomplished that she should be delivered.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	7	And she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger: because there was no room for them in the inn. Her firstborn.... The meaning is, not that she had afterward any other child; but it is a way of speech among the Hebrews, to call them also the firstborn, who are the only children. See annotation Matt. 1. 25.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	8	And there were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping the night watches over their flock.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	9	And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them and the brightness of God shone round about them: and they feared with a great fear.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	10	And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy that shall be to all the people:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	11	For, this day is born to you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	12	And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	14	Glory to God in the highest: and on earth peace to men of good will.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	15	And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	16	And they came with haste: and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	17	And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	18	And all that heard wondered: and at those things that were told them by the shepherds.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	19	But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	21	And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	22	And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	23	As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	24	And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	25	And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon: and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Ghost was in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	26	And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	28	He also took him into his arms and blessed God and said	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	29	Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word in peace:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	30	Because my eyes have seen thy salvation,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	32	A light to the revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	33	And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be contradicted. For the fall, etc.... Christ came for the salvation of all men; but here Simeon prophesies what would come to pass, that many through their own wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in Christ, nor receive his doctrine, which therefore would be ruin to them: but to others a resurrection, by their believing in him, and obeying his commandments.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	35	And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts thoughts may be revealed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser. She was far advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	37	And she was a widow until fourscore and four years: who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	38	Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord: and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	39	And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	40	And the child grew and waxed strong, full of wisdom: and the grace of God was in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	41	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	42	And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	43	And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem. And his parents knew it not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	44	And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day’s journey and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	45	And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	46	And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them and asking them questions.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	47	And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	48	And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	49	And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be about my father’s business?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	50	And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	51	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	52	And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace with God and men. Luke Chapter 3 John’s mission and preaching. Christ is baptized by him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilina:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	2	Under the high priests Annas and Caiphas: the word of the Lord was made unto John, the son of Zachary, in the desert.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	3	And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of penance for the remission of sins.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	4	As it was written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the prophet: A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	5	Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways plain.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	7	He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized by him: Ye offspring of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance: and do not begin to say, We have Abraham for our father. For I say unto you that God is able of these stones, to raise up children to Abraham.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	9	For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	10	And the people asked him, saying: What then shall we do?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	11	And he answering, said to them: He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	12	And the publicans also came to be baptized and said to him: Master, what shall we do?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	13	But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	14	And the soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Do violence to no man, neither calumniate any man; and be content with your pay.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	15	And as the people were of opinion, and all were thinking in their hearts of John, that perhaps he might be the Christ:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	16	John answered, saying unto all: I indeed baptize you with water: but there shall come one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire;	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	17	Whose fan is in his hand: and he will purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his barn: but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	18	And many other things exhorting did he preach to the people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	20	He added this also above all and shut up John in prison.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	21	Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove, upon him. And a voice came from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son. In thee I am well pleased.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	23	And Jesus himself was beginning about the age of thirty years: being (as it was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was of Heli, who was of Mathat, Who was of Heli.... St. Joseph, who by nature was the son of Jacob, (St. Matt. 1. 16,) in the account of the law, was son of Heli. For Heli and Jacob were brothers, by the same mother; and Heli, who was the elder, dying without issue, Jacob, as the law directed, married his widow: in consequence of such marriage, his son Joseph was reputed in the law the son of Heli.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	24	Who was of Levi, who was of Melchi, who was of Janne, who was of Joseph,	8

THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	28	Who was of Melchi, who was of Addi, who was of Cosan, who was of Helmadan, who was of Her,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	29	Who was of Jesus, who was of Eliezer, who was of Jorim, who was of Mathat, who was of Levi,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	30	Who was of Simeon, who was of Judas, who was of Joseph, who was of Jona, who was of Eliakim,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	31	Who was of Melea, who was of Menna, who was of Mathatha, who was of Nathan, who was of David,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	32	Who was of Jesse, who was of Obed, who was of Booz, who was of Salmon, who was of Naasson,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	33	Who was of Aminadab, who was of Aram, who was of Esron, who was of Phares, who was of Judas,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	34	Who was of Jacob, who was of Isaac, who was of Abraham, who was of Thare, who was of Nachor,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	35	Who was of Sarug, who was of Ragau, who was of Phaleg, who was of Heber, who was of Sale,	8

THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	37	Who was of Mathusale, who was of Henoch, who was of Jared, who was of Malaleel, who was of Cainan,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	38	Who was of Henos, who was of Seth, who was of Adam, who was of God. Luke Chapter 4 Christ’s fasting and temptation. He is persecuted in Nazareth. His miracles in Capharnaum.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	1	And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the desert,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	2	For the space of forty days, and was tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	3	And the devil said to him: If thou be the Son of God, say to this stone that it be made bread.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	4	And Jesus answered him: It is written that Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	5	And the devil led him into a high mountain and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	6	And he said to him: To thee will I give all this power and the glory of them. For to me they are delivered: and to whom I will, I give them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	7	If thou therefore wilt adore before me, all shall be thine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	8	And Jesus answering said to him. It is written: Thou shalt adore the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	9	And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself from hence.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	10	For it is written that He hath given his angels charge over thee that they keep thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	11	And that in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	12	And Jesus answering, said to him: It is said: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	13	And all the temptation being ended, the devil departed from him for a time.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit, into Galilee: and the fame of him went out through the whole country.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	15	And he taught in their synagogues and was magnified by all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	16	And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up: and he went into the synagogue, according to his custom, on the sabbath day: and he rose up to read.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	17	And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him. And as he unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	18	The spirit of the Lord is upon me. Wherefore he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	19	To preach deliverance to the captives and sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of reward.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	20	And when he had folded the book, he restored it to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	21	And he began to say to them: This day is fulfilled this scripture in your ears.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	22	And all gave testimony to him. And they wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth. And they said: Is not this the son of Joseph?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	23	And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: Physician, heal thyself. As great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	24	And he said: Amen I say to you that no prophet is accepted in his own country.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	25	In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	26	And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow woman.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	28	And all they in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with anger.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	29	And they rose up and thrust him out of the city: and they brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	30	But he passing through the midst of them, went his way.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	31	And he went down into Capharnaum, a city of Galilee: and there he taught them on the sabbath days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	32	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his speech was with power.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil: and he cried out with a loud voice,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	34	Saying: Let us alone. What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace and go out of him. And when the devil had thrown him into the midst, he went out of him and hurt him not at all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	36	And there came fear upon all; and they talked among themselves, saying: What word is this, for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they go out?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	37	And the fame of him was published into every place of the country.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	38	And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue, went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever: and they besought him for her.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	39	And standing over her, he commanded the fever: and it left her. And immediately rising, she ministered to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	40	And when the sun was down, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him. But he, laying his hands on every one of them, healed them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	41	And devils went out from many, crying out and saying: Thou art the son of God. And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak; for they knew that he was Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	42	And when it was day, going out he went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought him, and came unto him. And they stayed him that he should not depart from them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	43	To whom he said: To other cities also I must preach the kingdom of God: for therefore am I sent.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. Luke Chapter 5 The miraculous draught of fishes. The cure of the leper and of the paralytic. The call of Matthew.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	1	And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	2	And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	3	And going into one of the ships that was Simon’s, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting, he taught the multitudes out of the ship.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	4	Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	5	And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have laboured all the night and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	6	And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	7	And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	8	Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	9	For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	10	And so were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	11	And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	12	And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy who, seeing Jesus and falling on his face, besought him saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	13	And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will. Be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	14	And he charged him that he should tell no man, but: Go, shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	15	But the fame of him went abroad the more: and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	16	And he retired into the desert; and prayed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	18	And behold, men brought in a bed a man who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	20	Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	21	And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	22	And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	23	Which is easier to say: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise and walk?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	24	But that you may know that the Son of man hath the power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed and go into thy house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	25	And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay: and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	26	And all were astonished: and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying: We have seen wonderful things to-day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	27	And after these things, he went forth and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him: Follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	28	And leaving all things, he rose up and followed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: And there was a great company of publicans and of others that were at table with them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	30	But the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying to his disciples: Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	31	And Jesus answering, said to them: They that are whole need not the physician: but they that are sick.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	32	I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	33	And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine eat and drink?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	34	To whom he said: Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast whilst the bridegroom is with them?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	35	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: then shall they fast in those days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	36	And he spoke also a similitude to them: That no man putteth a piece from a new garment upon an old garment: otherwise he both rendeth the new, and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the new wine will break the bottles; and it will be spilled and the bottles will be lost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	38	But new wine must be put into new bottles: and both are preserved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	39	And no man drinking old hath presently a mind to new: for he saith: The old is better. Luke Chapter 6 Christ excuses his disciples. He cures upon the sabbath day, chooses the twelve and makes a sermon to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	1	And it came to pass on the second first sabbath that, as he went through the corn fields, his disciples plucked the ears and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. The second first sabbath.... Some understand this of the sabbath of Pentecost, which was the second in course among the great feasts: others, of a sabbath day that immediately followed any solemn feast.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	2	And some of the Pharisees said to them: Why do you that which is not lawful on the sabbath days?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	3	And Jesus answering them, said: Have you not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry and they that were with him:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	4	How he went into the house of God and took and ate the bread of proposition and gave to them that were with him, which is not lawful to eat but only for the priests?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	5	And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	6	And it came to pass also, on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath: that they might find an accusation against him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	8	But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand: Arise and stand forth in the midst. And rising he stood forth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	9	Then Jesus said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil? To save life or to destroy?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	10	And looking round about on them all, he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth. And his hand was restored.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	11	And they were filled with madness: and they talked one with another, what they might do to Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	12	And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray: and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	13	And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples: and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles):	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	14	Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	15	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who is called Zelotes,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	16	And Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	17	And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place: and the company of his disciples and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast, both of Tyre and Sidon,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	18	Who were come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	19	And all the multitude sought to touch him: for virtue went out from him and healed all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	20	And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	22	Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	23	Be glad in that day and rejoice: for behold, your reward is great in heaven, For according to these things did their fathers to the prophets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	24	But woe to you that are rich: for you have your consolation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	25	Woe to you that are filled: for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh: for you shall mourn and weep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	26	Woe to you when men shall bless you: for according to these things did their fathers to the false prophets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	27	But I say to you that hear: Love your enemies. Do good to them that hate you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	28	Bless them that curse you and pray for them that calumniate you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	29	And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek, offer also the other. And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	30	Give to every one that asketh thee: and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	31	And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them in like manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	32	And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you? For sinners also love those that love them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	33	And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks are to you? For sinners also do this.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	34	And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks are to you? For sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	35	But love ye your enemies: do good, and lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest. For he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	37	Judge not: and you shall not be judged. Condemn not: and you shall not be condemned. Forgive: and you shall be forgiven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	38	Give: and it shall be given to you: good measure and pressed down and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	39	And he spoke also to them a similitude: Can the blind lead the blind? Do they not both fall into the ditch?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	40	The disciple is not above his master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be as his master.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	41	And why seest thou the mote in thy brother’s eye: but the beam that is in thy own eye thou considerest not?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye: and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother’s eye.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	43	For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit: nor an evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	44	For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns: nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	46	And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	47	Every one that cometh to me and heareth my words and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	48	He is like to a man building a house, who digged deep and laid the foundation upon a rock. And when a flood came, the stream beat vehemently upon that house: and it could not shake it: for it was founded on a rock.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	49	But he that heareth and doth not is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation: against which the stream beat vehemently. And immediately it fell: and the ruin of that house was great. Luke Chapter 7 Christ heals the centurion’s servant. He raises the widow’s son to life, answers the messengers sent by John and absolves the penitent sinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	1	And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capharnaum.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	2	And the servant of a certain centurion who was dear to him, being sick, was ready to die.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	3	And when he had heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the ancients of the Jews, desiring him to come and heal his servant.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying to him: He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	5	For he loveth our nation: and he hath built us a synagogue.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	6	And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent his friends to him, saying: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	7	For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	8	For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	9	Which Jesus hearing, marvelled: and turning about to the multitude that followed him, he said: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith, not even in Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	10	And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	11	And it came to pass afterwards that he went into a city that is called Naim: and there went with him his disciples and a great multitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	12	And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother: and she was a widow. And a great multitude of the city was with her.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	13	Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	14	And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	15	And he that was dead sat up and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	16	And there came a fear upon them all: and they glorified God saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the country round about.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	18	And John’s disciples told him of all these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	19	And John called to him two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he that art to come? Or look we for another?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	20	And when the men were come unto him, they said: John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying: Art thou he that art to come? Or look we for another?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	21	(And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases and hurts and evil spirits: and to many that were blind he gave sight.)	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	22	And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the gospel is preached.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	23	And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John. What went ye out into the desert to see? A reed shaken with the wind?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	25	But what went you out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately are in the houses of kings.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	26	But what went you out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	27	This is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	28	For I say to you: Amongst those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he that is the lesser in the kingdom of God is greater than he.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	29	And all the people hearing, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with John’s baptism. Justified God.... that is, praised the justice of God, feared and worshipped God, as just and merciful.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	31	And the Lord said: Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? And to what are they like?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	32	They are like to children sitting in the marketplace and speaking one to another and saying: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have mourned, and you have not wept.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine. And you say: He hath a devil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking. And you say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	35	And wisdom is justified by all her children.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee and sat down to meat. One of the Pharisees: that is, Simon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	37	And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	38	And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	39	And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were if a prophet, would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	40	And Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. But he said: Master, say it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	41	A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	42	And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two loveth him most?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	43	Simon answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	44	And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon: Dost thou see this woman? I entered into thy house: thou gavest me no water for my feet. But she with tears hath washed my feet; and with her hairs hath wiped them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss. But she, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint. But she with ointment hath anointed my feet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	47	Wherefore, I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less. Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much.... In the scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause, when there are divers other concurring dispositions; for the sins of this woman, in this verse, are said to be forgiven, because she loved much: but (ver. 50) Christ tells her, Thy faith hath made thee safe. Hence in a true conversion are joined faith, hope, love, sorrow for sin, and other pious dispositions.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	48	And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	50	And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe. Go in peace. Luke Chapter 8 The parable of the seed. Christ stills the storm at sea, casts out the legion, heals the issue of blood and raises the daughter of Jairus to life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	1	And it came to pass afterwards, that he travelled through the cities and towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God: and the twelve with him:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	2	And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven devils were gone forth,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod’s steward, and Susanna and many others who ministered unto him of their substance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	4	And when a very great multitude was gathered together and hastened out of the cities, unto him, he spoke by a similitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	5	The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side. And it was trodden down: and the fowls of the air devoured it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	6	And other some fell upon a rock. And as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	7	And other some fell among thorns. And the thorns growing up with it, choked it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	8	And other some fell upon good ground and, being sprung up, yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, he cried out: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	9	And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	10	To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see and hearing may not understand. Seeing they may not see.... See the annotation, Mark 4. 12.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	12	And they by the way side are they that hear: then the devil cometh and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	13	Now they upon the rock are they who when they hear receive the word with joy: and these have no roots: for they believe for a while and in time of temptation they fall away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	14	And that which fell among thorns are they who have heard and, going their way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and yield no fruit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	15	But that on the good ground are they who in a good and perfect heart, hearing the word, keep it and bring forth fruit in patience.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	16	Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed: but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	17	For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest, nor hidden that shall not be known and come abroad.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	18	Take heed therefore how you hear. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given: and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath shall be taken away from him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	19	And his mother and brethren came unto him: and they could not come at him for the crowd.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	20	And it was told him: Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	21	Who answering, said to them: My mother and my brethren are they who hear the word of God and do it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	22	And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with his disciples. And he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	23	And when they were sailing, he slept. And there came down a storm of wind upon the lake: and they were filled and were in danger.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	24	And they came and awaked him, saying: Master, we perish. But he arising, rebuked the wind and the rage of the water. And it ceased: and there was a calm.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	25	And he said to them: Where is your faith? Who being afraid, wondered, saying one to another: Who is this (think you), that he commandeth both the winds and the sea: and they obey him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	26	And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens, which is over against Galilee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	27	And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man who had a devil now a very long time. And he wore no clothes: neither did he abide in a house, but in the sepulchres.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	28	And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him. And crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	29	For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man. For many times it seized him: and he was bound with chains and kept in fetters: and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	30	And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion. Because many devils were entered into him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	33	The devils therefore went out of the man and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were stifled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	34	Which when they that fed them saw done, they fled away and told it in the city and in the villages.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	35	And they went out to see what was done. And they came to Jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at his feet, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	36	And they also that had seen told them how he had been healed from the legion.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	37	And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them: for they were taken with great fear. And he, going up into the ship, returned back again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	38	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	39	Return to thy house and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	40	And it came to pass that when Jesus was returned, the multitude received him: for they were all waiting for him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	41	And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus: and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at the feet of Jesus, beseeching him that he would come into his house:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	42	For he had an only daughter, almost twelve years old, and she was dying. And it happened as he went that he was thronged by the multitudes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	43	And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had bestowed all her substance on physicians and could not be healed by any.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	44	She came behind him and touched the hem of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stopped.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	45	And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, Peter and they that were with him said: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee; and dost thou say, who touched me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	46	And Jesus said: Somebody hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out from me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	47	And the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling and fell down before his feet and declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	48	But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. Go thy way in peace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	49	As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him: Thy daughter is dead: trouble him not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	50	And Jesus hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not. Believe only: and she shall be safe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	51	And when he was come to the house, he suffered not any man to go in with him, but Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	52	And all wept and mourned for her. But he said: Weep not. The maid is not dead, but sleepeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	54	But he taking her by the hand, cried out, saying: Maid, arise.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	55	And her spirit returned: and she arose immediately. And he bid them give her to eat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	56	And her parents were astonished, whom he charged to tell no man what was done. Luke Chapter 9 Christ sends forth his apostles, feeds five thousand with five loaves, is transfigured and casts out a devil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	1	Then calling together the twelve apostles, he gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	3	And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	4	And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there and depart not from thence.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	5	And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	6	And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing every where.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	7	Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all things that were done by him. And he was in a doubt, because it was said	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	8	By some that John was risen from the dead: but by other some, that Elias had appeared: and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	9	And Herod said: John I have beheaded. But who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all they had done. And taking them, he went aside into a desert place, apart, which belongeth to Bethsaida.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	11	Which when the people knew, they followed him: and he received them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and healed them who had need of healing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	12	Now the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to him: Send away the multitude, that, going into the towns and villages round about, they may lodge and get victuals; for we are here in a desert place.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	13	But he said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said: We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps, we should go and buy food for all this multitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	14	Now there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them sit down by fifties in a company.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	15	And they did so and made them all sit down.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them: and he broke and distributed to his disciples, to set before the multitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	17	And they did all eat and were filled. And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	18	And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples also were with him: and he asked them, saying: Whom do the people say that I am?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	19	But they answered and said: John the Baptist; but some say Elias: and others say that one of the former prophets is risen again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	20	And he said to them: But whom do you say that I am? Simon Peter answering, said: The Christ of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	21	But he strictly charging them, commanded they should tell this to no man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	22	Saying: The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the ancients and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day rise again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	23	And he said to all: If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: for he that shall lose his life for my sake shall save it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	25	For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world and lose himself and cast away himself?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	26	For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of man shall be ashamed, when he shall come in his majesty and that of his Father and of the holy angels.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	27	But I tell you of a truth: There are some standing here that shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	28	And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that he took Peter and James and John and went up into a mountain to pray.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	29	And whilst he prayed, the shape of his countenance was altered and his raiment became white and glittering.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	30	And behold two men were talking with him. And they were Moses and Elias,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	31	Appearing in majesty. And they spoke of his decease that he should accomplish in Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And waking, they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	33	And it came to pass that, as they were departing from him, Peter saith to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses; and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	34	And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they were afraid when they entered into the cloud.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	35	And a voice came out of the cloud; saying: This is my beloved son. Hear him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	36	And whilst the voice was uttered Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	37	And it came to pass the day following, when they came down from the mountain, there met him a great multitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	38	And behold a man among the crowd cried out, saying: Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is my only one.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	39	And lo, a spirit seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he throweth him down and teareth him, so that he foameth; and bruising him, he hardly departeth from him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	40	And I desired thy disciples to cast him out: and they could not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	41	And Jesus, answering, said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	42	And as he was coming to him, the devil threw him down and tore him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	43	And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and cured the boy and restored him to his father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	44	And all were astonished at the mighty power of God. But while all wondered at all the things he did, he said to his disciples: Lay you up in your hearts these words, for it shall come to pass that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	45	But they understood not this word: and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not. And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	46	And there entered a thought into them, which of them should be greater.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	47	But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their hearts, took a child and set him by him,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	48	And said to them: Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me. For he that is the lesser among you all, he is the greater.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	49	And John, answering, said: Master, we saw a certain man casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	50	And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	51	And it came to pass, when the days of his assumption were accomplishing, that he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	52	And he sent messengers before his face: and going, they entered into a city of the Samaritans, to prepare for him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	53	And they received him not, because his face was of one going to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	54	And when his disciples, James and John, had seen this, they said: Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	55	And turning, he rebuked them, saying: you know not of what spirit you are.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	56	The Son of man came not to destroy souls, but to save. And they went into another town.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	57	And it came to pass, as they walked in the way, that a certain man said to him: I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	58	Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	59	But he said to another: Follow me. And he said: Lord, suffer me first to go and to bury my father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	60	And Jesus said to him: Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	61	And another said: I will follow thee, Lord; but let me first take my leave of them that are at my house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	62	Jesus said to him: No man putting his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God. Luke Chapter 10 Christ sends forth and instructs his seventy-two disciples. The good Samaritan.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	1	And after these things, the Lord appointed also other seventy-two. And he sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself was to come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	2	And he said to them: The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send labourers into his harvest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	3	Go: Behold I send you as lambs among wolves.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	4	Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	5	Into whatever house you enter, first say: Peace be to this house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	6	And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall return to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	7	And in the same house, remain, eating and drinking such things as they have: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Remove not from house to house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	8	And into what city soever you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	9	And heal the sick that are therein and say to them: The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	10	But into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you not, going forth into the streets thereof, say:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	11	Even the very dust of your city that cleaveth to us, we wipe off against you. Yet know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	12	I say to you, it shall be more tolerable at that day for Sodom than for that city.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	13	Woe to thee, Corozain! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the mighty works that have been wrought in you, they would have done penance long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	15	And thou, Capharnaum, which art exalted unto heaven, thou shalt be thrust down to hell.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	16	He that heareth you heareth me: and he that despiseth you despiseth me: and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	17	And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying: Lord, the devils also are subject to us in thy name.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	18	And he said to them: I saw Satan like lightning falling from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	19	Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	20	But yet rejoice not in this, that spirits are subject unto you: but rejoice in this, that your names are written in heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	21	In that same hour, he rejoiced in the Holy Ghost and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to little ones. Yea, Father, for so it hath seemed good in thy sight. He rejoiced in the Holy Ghost.... That is, according to his humanity he rejoiced in the Holy Ghost, and gave thanks to his eternal Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	22	All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth who the Son is, but the Father: and who the Father is, but the Son and to whom the Son will reveal him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	23	And turning to his disciples, he said: Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	24	For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	25	And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	26	But he said to him: What is written in the law? How readest thou?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	27	He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	28	And he said to him: Thou hast answered right. This do: and thou shalt live.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	29	But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	30	And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who also stripped him and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	31	And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	32	In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	33	But a certain Samaritan, being on his journey, came near him: and seeing him, was moved with compassion:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	34	And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	35	And the next day he took out two pence and gave to the host and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	36	Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	37	But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	38	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain town: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary, who, sitting also at the Lord’s feet, heard his word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	40	But Martha was busy about much serving. Who stood and said: Lord, hast thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve? Speak to her therefore, that she help me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	41	And the Lord answering, said to her: Martha, Martha, thou art careful and art troubled about many things:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	42	But one thing is necessary. Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her. Luke Chapter 11 Christ teaches his disciples to pray. He casts out a dumb devil, confutes the Pharisees, and pronounces woes against them for their hypocrisy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	1	And it came to pass that as he was in a certain place praying, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	2	And he said to them: When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	3	Give us this day our daily bread.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	4	And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	5	And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	6	Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me and I have not what to set before him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	7	And he from within should answer and say: Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	8	Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	9	And I say to you: Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	10	For every one that asketh receiveth: and he that seeketh findeth: and to him that knocketh it shall be opened:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	11	And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? Or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	12	Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	13	If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	14	And he was casting out a devil: and the same was dumb. And when he had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes, were in admiration at it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	15	But some of them said: He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	16	And others tempting, asked of him a sign from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	17	But he seeing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to desolation; and house upon house shall fall.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	18	And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because you say that through Beelzebub I cast out devils.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	19	Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	20	But if I by the finger of God cast out devils, doubtless the kingdom of God is come upon you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	21	When a strong man armed keepeth his court, those things are in peace which he possesseth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	22	But if a stronger than he come upon him and overcome him, he will take away all his armour wherein he trusted and will distribute his spoils.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	23	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through places without water, seeking rest: and not finding, he saith: I will return into my house whence I came out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	25	And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	26	Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself: and entering in they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	27	And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him: Blessed is the womb that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	28	But he said: Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	29	And the multitudes running together, he began to say: This generation is a wicked generation. It asketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	30	For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites; so shall the Son of man also be to this generation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold more than Solomon here.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	32	The men of Ninive shall rise in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it; Because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold more than Jonas here.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	33	No man lighteth a candle and putteth it in a hidden place, nor under a bushel: but upon a candlestick, that they that come in may see the light.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	34	The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body will be lightsome: but if it be evil, thy body also will be darksome.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	36	If then thy whole body be lightsome, having no part of darkness: the whole shall be lightsome and, as a bright lamp, shall enlighten thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	37	And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee prayed him that he would dine with him. And he going in, sat down to eat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	38	And the Pharisee began to say, thinking within himself, why he was not washed before dinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	39	And the Lord said to him: Now you, Pharisees, make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter: but your inside is full of rapine and iniquity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	40	Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make also that which is within?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	41	But yet that which remaineth, give alms: and behold, all things are clean unto you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	42	But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb and pass over judgment and the charity of God. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	43	Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and salutations in the marketplace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	44	Woe to you, because you are as sepulchres that appear not: and men that walk over are not aware.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	45	And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him: Master, in saying these things, thou reproachest us also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	46	But he said: Woe to you lawyers also, because you load men with burdens which they cannot bear and you yourselves touch not the packs with one of your fingers. Woe to you lawyers.... He speaks of the doctors of the law of Moses, commonly called the scribes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	47	Woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets: and your fathers killed them. Woe to you who build, etc.... Not that the building of the monuments of the prophets was in itself blameworthy, but only the intention of these unhappy men, who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety, as a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of prophets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	48	Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your fathers. For they indeed killed them: and you build their sepulchres.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	49	For this cause also the wisdom of God said: I will send to them prophets and apostles: and some of them they will kill and persecute.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	50	That the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	51	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who was slain between the altar and the temple. Yea I say to you: It shall be required of this generation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	52	Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves have not entered in: and those that were entering in, you have hindered.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	53	And as he was saying these things to them, the Pharisees and the lawyers began violently to urge him and to oppress his mouth about many things,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	54	Lying in wait for him and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him. Luke Chapter 12 Christ warns us against hypocrisy, the fear of the world and covetousness. He admonishes all to watch.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	1	And when great multitudes stood about him, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples: Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	2	For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed: nor hidden that shall not be known.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	3	For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness shall be published in the light: and that which you have spoken in the ear in the chambers shall be preached on the housetops.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	4	And I say to you, my friends: Be not afraid of them who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	5	But I will shew you whom you shall fear: Fear ye him who, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you: Fear him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	7	Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	8	And I say to you: Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	9	But he that shall deny me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	10	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	11	And when they shall bring you into the synagogues and to magistrates and powers, be not solicitous how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	12	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you must say.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	13	And one of the multitude said to him: Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	14	But he said to him: Man, who hath appointed me judge or divider over you?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	15	And he said to them: Take heed and beware of all covetousness: for a man’s life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he possesseth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	16	And he spoke a similitude to them, saying: The land of a certain rich man brought forth plenty of fruits.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	17	And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	18	And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns and will build greater: and into them will I gather all things that are grown to me and my goods.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	19	And I will say to my soul: Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years. Take thy rest: eat, drink, make good cheer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	20	But God said to him: Thou fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee. And whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	22	And he said to his disciples: Therefore I say to you: Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	23	The life is more than the meat: and the body is more than the raiment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	24	Consider the ravens, for they sow not, neither do they reap, neither have they storehouse nor barn, and God feedeth them. How much are you more valuable than they?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	25	And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	26	If then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing, why are you solicitous for the rest?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	27	Consider the lilies, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin. But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	28	Now, if God clothe in this manner the grass that is to-day in the field and to-morrow is cast into the oven: how much more you, O ye of little faith?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	29	And seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink: and be not lifted up on high.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek. But your Father knoweth that you have need of these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	31	But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice: and all these things shall be added unto you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	32	Fear not, little flock, for it hath pleased your Father to give you a kingdom.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	33	Sell what you possess and give alms. Make to yourselves bags which grow not old, a treasure in heaven which faileth not: where no thief approacheth, nor moth corrupteth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	35	Let your loins be girt and lamps burning in your hands.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	36	And you yourselves like to men who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	37	Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall find watching. Amen I say to you that he will gird himself and make them sit down to meat and passing will minister unto them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so, blessed are those servants.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	39	But this know ye, that if the householder did know at what hour the thief would come, he would surely watch and would not suffer his house to be broken open.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	40	Be you then also ready: for at what hour you think not the Son of man will come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	41	And Peter said to him: Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us, or likewise to all?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	42	And the Lord said: Who thinkest thou is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord setteth over his family, to give them their measure of wheat in due season?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	43	Blessed is that servant whom, when his lord shall come, he shall find so doing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	44	Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he possesseth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	45	But if that servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a coming; and shall begin to strike the men-servants and maid-servants, and to eat and to drink and be drunk:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	46	The lord of that servant will come in the day that he hopeth not, and at the hour that he knoweth not: and shall separate him and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	47	And that servant, who knew the will of his lord and prepared not himself and did not according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	48	But he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. And unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required: and to whom they have committed much, of him they will demand the more.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	49	I am come to cast fire on the earth. And what will I, but that it be kindled?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	50	And I have a baptism wherewith I am to be baptized. And how am I straitened until it be accomplished?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	51	Think ye, that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no; but separation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	52	For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided: three against two, and two against three.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son and the son against his father: the mother against the daughter and the daughter against her mother: the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	54	And he said also to the multitudes: When you see a cloud rising from the west, presently you say: A shower is coming. And so it happeneth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	55	And when ye see the south wind blow, you say: There will be heat. And it cometh to pass.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	56	You hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the heaven and of the earth: but how is it that you do not discern this time?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	57	And why, even of yourselves, do you not judge that which is just?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	58	And when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince, whilst thou art in the way, endeavour to be delivered from him: lest perhaps he draw thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exacter, and the exacter cast thee into prison.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	59	I say to thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last mite. Luke Chapter 13 The necessity of penance. The barren fig tree. The cure of the infirm woman. The journey to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	1	And there were present, at that very time, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	2	And he answering, said to them: Think you that these Galileans were sinners above all the men of Galilee, because they suffered such things?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	3	No, I say to you: but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	4	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe and slew them: think you that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	5	No, I say to you: but except you do penance, you shall all likewise perish.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	6	He spoke also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard: and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	7	And he said to the dresser of the vineyard: Behold, for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down therefore. Why cumbereth it the ground?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	8	But he answering, said to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig about it and dung it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	9	And if happily it bear fruit: but if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	10	And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	11	And behold there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. And she was bowed together: neither could she look upwards at all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	12	Whom when Jesus saw, he called her unto him and said to her: Woman, thou art delivered from thy infirmity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	13	And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight and glorified God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	14	And the ruler of the synagogue being angry that Jesus had healed on the sabbath answering, said to the multitude: Six days there are wherein you ought to work. In them therefore come and be healed: and not on the sabbath day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	15	And the Lord answering him, said: Ye hypocrites, doth not every one of you, on the sabbath day, loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead them to water?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	16	And ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	17	And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done by him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	18	He said therefore: To what is the kingdom of God like, and whereunto shall I resemble it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	19	It is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden: and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	20	And again he said: Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God to be like?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	21	It is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	22	And he went through the cities and towns teaching and making his journey to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	23	And a certain man said to him: Lord, are they few that are saved? But he said to them:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	24	Strive to enter by the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter and shall not be able. Shall seek, etc.... Shall desire to be saved; but for want of taking sufficient pains, and being thoroughly in earnest, shall not attain to it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	25	But when the master of the house shall be gone in and shall shut the door, you shall begin to stand without; and knock at the door, saying: Lord, open to us. And he answering, shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	26	Then you shall begin to say: We have eaten and drunk in thy presence: and thou hast taught in our streets.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	27	And he shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God: and you yourselves thrust out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	29	And there shall come from the east and the west and the north and the south: and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	30	And behold, they are last that shall be first: and they are first that shall be last.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	31	The same day, there came some of the Pharisees, saying to him: Depart, and get thee hence, for Herod hath a mind to kill thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	32	And he said to them: Go and tell that fox: Behold, I cast out devils and do cures, to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am consummated.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	33	Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow and the day following, because it cannot be that a prophet perish, out of Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	34	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets; and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	35	Behold your house shall be left to you desolate. And I say to you that you shall not see me till the time come when you shall say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Luke Chapter 14 Christ heals the dropsical man. The parable of the supper. The necessity of renouncing all to follow Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	1	And it came to pass, when Jesus went into the house of one of the chief of the Pharisees, on the sabbath day, to eat bread, that they watched him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	2	And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	3	And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	4	But they held their peace. But he taking him, healed him and sent him away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	5	And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	6	And they could not answer him to these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	7	And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	8	When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	9	And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee: Give this man place. And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	10	But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	11	Because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	12	And he said to him also that had invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	13	But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	14	And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense: for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	15	When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these things, he said to him: Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	16	But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper and invited many.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	17	And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come: for now all things are ready.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	18	And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it. I pray thee, hold me excused.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	19	And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to try them. I pray thee, hold me excused.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	20	And another said: I have married a wife; and therefore I cannot come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	21	And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city; and bring in hither the poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	22	And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	23	And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	24	But I say unto you that none of those men that were invited shall taste of my supper.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	25	And there went great multitudes with him. And turning, he said to them:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	26	If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. Hate not, etc.... The law of Christ does not allow us to hate even our enemies, much less our parents: but the meaning of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of soul, as to be willing to renounce, and part with every thing, how near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	27	And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	28	For which of you, having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to finish it:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	29	Lest, after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that see it begin to mock him,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	30	Saying: This man began to build and was not able to finish.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	31	Or, what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	32	Or else, while the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	33	So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth cannot be my disciple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	34	Salt is good. But if the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	35	It is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill: but shall be cast out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Luke Chapter 15 The parables of the lost sheep and of the prodigal son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	1	Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	2	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	3	And he spoke to them this parable, saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	4	What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after that which was lost, until he find it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	5	And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	6	And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	7	I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	8	Or what woman having ten groats, if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	9	And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	10	So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance. Before the angels.... By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven have a concern for us below, and a joy at our repentance and consequently a knowledge of it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	11	And he said: A certain man had two sons.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	13	And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	14	And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country: and he began to be in want.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	15	And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	17	And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father’s house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	18	I will arise and will go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	19	I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	20	And rising up, he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to him fell upon his neck and kissed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	21	And the son said to him: Father: I have sinned against heaven and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	22	And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe and put it on him: and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	23	And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat and make merry:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	24	Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	26	And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	27	And he said to him: Thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	28	And he was angry and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	29	And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	30	But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	31	But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me; and all I have is thine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	32	But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found. Luke Chapter 16 The parable of the unjust steward and of the rich man and Lazarus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	1	And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	2	And he called him and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	3	And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	4	I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	5	Therefore, calling together every one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	6	But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	7	Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill and write eighty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	8	And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	9	And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity: that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings. Mammon of iniquity.... Mammon signifies riches. They are here called the mammon of iniquity, because oftentimes ill gotten, ill bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false; and not the true riches of a Christian. They may receive.... By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little is unjust also in that which is greater.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	11	If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon, who will trust you with that which is the true?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	12	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	13	No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other: or he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	14	Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	15	And he said to them: you are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts. For that which is high to men is an abomination before God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the kingdom of God is preached: and every one useth violence towards it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fall.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	18	Every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	19	There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	20	And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	21	Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. And no one did give him: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	22	And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell. Abraham’s bosom.... The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	23	And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	24	And he cried and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	25	And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	26	And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot, nor from thence come hither.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	27	And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee that thou wouldst send him to my father’s house, for I have five brethren,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	28	That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	29	And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	30	But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	31	And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead. Luke Chapter 17 Lessons of avoiding scandal and of the efficacy of faith. The ten lepers. The manner of the coming of Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	1	And he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come. But woe to him through whom they come!	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	2	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	3	Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	4	And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying: I repent: forgive him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	6	And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree: Be thou rooted up and be thou transplanted into the sea. And it would obey you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	7	But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go. Sit down to meat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	8	And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper and gird thyself and serve me, whilst I eat and drink; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	9	Doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he commanded him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	10	I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do. Unprofitable servants.... Because our service is of no profit to our master; and he justly claims it as our bounden duty. But though we are unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us; for he is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his promise, entitles them to an eternal reward.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	11	And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	12	And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	13	And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	14	Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	15	And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	16	And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks. And this was a Samaritan.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	17	And Jesus answering, said: Were not ten made clean? And where are the nine?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	18	There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	19	And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	20	And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	21	Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	22	And he said to his disciples: The days will come when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man. And you shall not see it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	23	And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	24	For as the lightning that lighteneth from under heaven shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	25	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	26	And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	27	They did eat and drink, they married wives and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	28	Likewise as it came to pass in the days of Lot. They did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	29	And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	31	In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	32	Remember Lot’s wife.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	34	I say to you: In that night there shall be two men in one bed. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	35	Two women shall be grinding together. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left. Two men shall be in the field. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	36	They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	37	Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together. Luke Chapter 18 We must pray always. The Pharisee and the publican. The danger of riches. The blind man is restored to sight.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	1	And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray and not to faint,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	2	Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God nor regarded man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	3	And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. Avenge.... That is, do me justice. It is a Hebraism.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	4	And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	5	Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	6	And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	7	And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	8	I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	9	And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others, he spoke also this parable:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	11	The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	12	I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	13	And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	14	I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	15	And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	16	But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	17	Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	18	And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	19	And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	21	Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	22	Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee. Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	23	He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	24	And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	26	And they that heard it said: Who then can be saved?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	27	He said to them: The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	28	Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	29	Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left home or parents or brethren or wife or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	30	Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	31	Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	32	For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	33	And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall rise again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	34	And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them: and they understood not the things that were said.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	35	Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	36	And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	37	And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	38	And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	39	And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	40	And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	41	Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	42	And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	43	And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God. Luke Chapter 19 Zacheus entertains Christ. The parable of the pounds. Christ rides upon an ass and weeps over Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	1	And entering he walked through Jericho.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	2	And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans: and he was rich.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	4	And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him: for he was to pass that way.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	5	And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down: for this day I must abide in thy house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	6	And he made haste and came down and received him with joy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	7	And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	8	But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	9	Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	10	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	11	As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	12	He said therefore: a certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	13	And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds and said to them: Trade till I come. He gave them ten pounds.... In the original, what is here translated a pound, is in Latin, mina, in value of our coin, three pounds two shillings and sixpence.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	14	But his citizens hated him and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	15	And it came to pass that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	16	And the first came saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	17	And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	18	And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	19	And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	20	And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	21	For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down: and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	22	He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down and reaping that which I did not sow.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	23	And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have exacted it with usury?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	24	And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him and give it to him that hath ten pounds.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	25	And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	26	But I say to you that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	27	But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither and kill them before me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	28	And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	29	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	30	Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him and bring him hither.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	31	And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? You shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	32	And they that were sent went their way and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	34	But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	36	And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	37	And when he was now coming near the descent of Mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	38	Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory on high!	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	39	And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	40	To whom he said: I say to you that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	41	And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	42	If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace: but now they are hidden from thy eyes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee: and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and straiten thee on every side,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	44	And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee. And they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	45	And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	46	Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	47	And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	48	And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. Luke Chapter 20 The parable of the husbandmen. Of paying tribute to Caesar and of the resurrection of the dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	1	And it came to pass that on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, with the ancients, met together,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	2	And spoke to him, saying: Tell us, by what authority dost thou these things? Or, who is he that hath given thee this authority?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	3	And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one thing. Answer me:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	4	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	5	But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From heaven: he will say: Why then did you not believe in him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	6	But if we say, of men: the whole people will stone us. For they are persuaded that John was a prophet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	7	And they answered that they knew not whence it was.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	8	And Jesus said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	9	And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen: and he was abroad for a long time.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him, sent him away empty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	11	And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also and, treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	12	And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also and cast him out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	13	Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be, when they see him, they will reverence him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	14	Whom, when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying: This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	15	So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	16	He will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: God forbid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	17	But he looking on them, said: What is this then that is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised: and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour: but they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke this parable to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	20	And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign themselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words, that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	21	And they asked him, saying: Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly: and thou dost not respect any person, but teachest the way of God in truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	23	But he, considering their guile, said to them: Why tempt you me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	24	Shew me a penny. Whose image and inscription hath it? They answering, said to him: Caesar’s.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	25	And he said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things, that are Caesar’s: and to God the things that are God’s.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	26	And they could not reprehend his word before the people: and wondering at his answer, they held their peace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	27	And there came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection: and they asked him,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	28	Saying: Master, Moses wrote unto us: If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should take her to wife and raise up seed unto his brother.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died without children.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	30	And the next took her to wife: and he also died childless.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	31	And the third took her. And in like manner, all the seven: and they left no children and died.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	32	Last of all the woman died also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	33	In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be? For all the seven had her to wife.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	34	And Jesus said to them: The children of this world marry and are given in marriage:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	35	But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and of the resurrection from the dead shall neither be married nor take wives.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	36	Neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	37	Now that the dead rise again, Moses also shewed at the bush, when he called the Lord: The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	38	For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	39	And some of the scribes answering, said to him: Master, thou hast said well.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	40	And after that they durst not ask him any more questions.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	41	But he said to them: How say they that Christ is the son of David?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	43	Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	44	David then calleth him Lord. And how is he his son?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	45	And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	46	Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and love salutations in the market place and the first chairs in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	47	Who devour the houses of widows, feigning long prayer. These shall receive greater damnation. Luke Chapter 21 The widow’s mites. The signs that should forerun the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	1	And looking on, he saw the rich men cast their gifts into the treasury.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in two brass mites.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	3	And he said: Verily, I say to you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	4	For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of God: but she of her want hath cast in all the living that she had.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	5	And some saying of the temple that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	6	These things which you see, the days will come in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	7	And they asked him, saying: Master, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when they shall begin to come to pass?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	8	Who said: Take heed you be not seduced: for many will come in my name, saying: I am he and the time is at hand. Go ye not therefore after them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	9	And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, be not terrified. These things must first come to pass: but the end is not yet presently.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	10	Then he said to them: Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	11	And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places and pestilences and famines and terrors from heaven: and there shall be great signs.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	12	But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons, dragging you before kings and governors, for my name’s sake.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	13	And it shall happen unto you for a testimony.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	14	Lay it up therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before how you shall answer:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	16	And you shall be betrayed by your parents and brethren and kinsmen and friends: and some of you they will put to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	17	And you shall be hated by all men for my name’s sake.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	18	But a hair of your head shall not perish.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	19	In your patience you shall possess your souls.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	20	And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed about with an army, then know that the desolation thereof is at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	21	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains: and those who are in the midst thereof depart out: and those who are in the countries not enter into it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	22	For these are the days of vengeance, that all things may be fulfilled, that are written.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	23	But woe to them that are with child and give suck in those days: for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captives into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles till the times of the nations be fulfilled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	25	And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea, and of the waves:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	26	Men withering away for fear and expectation of what shall come upon the whole world. For the powers of heaven shall be moved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	27	And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with great power and majesty.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	28	But when these things begin to come to pass, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	29	And he spoke to them a similitude. See the fig tree and all the trees:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	30	When they now shoot forth their fruit, you know that summer is nigh;	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	31	So you also, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	32	Amen, I say to you, this generation shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	33	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	34	And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life: and that day come upon you suddenly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	35	For as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of the whole earth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	36	Watch ye, therefore, praying at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come and to stand before the Son of man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	37	And in the daytime, he was teaching in the temple: but at night going out, he abode in the mount that is called Olivet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him. Luke Chapter 22 The treason of Judas. The last supper. The first part of the history of the passion.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	1	Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	2	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	3	And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	4	And he went and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	5	And they were glad and covenanted to give him money.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	6	And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	7	And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	8	And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	9	But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	10	And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	11	And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee: Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	12	And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished. And there prepare.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	13	And they going, found as he had said to them and made ready the pasch.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	14	And when the hour was come, he sat down: and the twelve apostles with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	15	And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	16	For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	17	And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks and said: Take and divide it among you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	18	For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	19	And taking bread, he gave thanks and brake and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. Do this for a commemoration of me.... This sacrifice and sacrament is to be continued in the church, to the end of the world, to shew forth the death of Christ, until he cometh. But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood, under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were redeemed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	20	In like manner, the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	21	But yet behold: the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	22	And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	23	And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	24	And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	25	And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them are called beneficent.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	26	But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger: and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	27	For which is greater, he that sitteth at table or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	28	And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	29	And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	30	That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	31	And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	32	But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	33	Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	34	And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	35	When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	36	But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and he that hath not, let him sell his coat and buy a sword.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	37	For I say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me. And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	38	But they said: Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them: It is enough.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	39	And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	40	And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	41	And he was withdrawn away from them a stone’s cast. And kneeling down, he prayed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	42	Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	43	And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	44	And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	45	And when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	46	And he said to them: Why sleep you? Arise: pray: lest you enter into temptation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	47	As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	48	And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	49	And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	51	But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	52	And Jesus said to the chief priests and magistrates of the temple and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	54	And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	56	Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	57	But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	58	And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not. Another, etc.... Observe here, in order to reconcile the four Evangelists, that divers persons concurred in charging Peter with being Christ’s disciple; till at length they brought him to deny him thrice. 1. The porteress that let him in, and afterwards seeing him at the fire, first put the question to him; and then positively affirmed that he was with Christ. 2. Another maid accused him to the standers by; and gave occasion to the man here mentioned to renew the charge against him, which caused the second denial. 3. Others of the company took notice of his being a Galilean; and were seconded by the kinsman of Malchus, who affirmed he had seen him in the garden. And this drew on the third denial.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	59	And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him: for he is also a Galilean.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	60	And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	61	And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	62	And Peter going out, wept bitterly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	63	And the men that held him mocked him and struck him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	64	And they blindfolded him and smote his face. And they asked him saying: Prophesy: Who is it that struck thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	65	And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	66	And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people and the chief priests and scribes came together. And they brought him into their council saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	67	And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	68	And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	69	But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	70	Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	22	71	And they said: What need we any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth. Luke Chapter 23 The continuation of the history of the passion.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	1	And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	2	And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he is Christ the king.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	3	And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	4	And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	5	But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	6	But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	7	And when he understood that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem in those days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	8	And Herod seeing Jesus, was very glad: for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	9	And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	11	And Herod with his army set him at nought and mocked him, putting on him a white garment: and sent him back to Pilate.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	12	And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day: for before they were enemies one to another.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	13	And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the magistrates and the people,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	14	Said to them: You have presented unto me this man as one that perverteth the people. And behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	15	No, nor Herod neither. For, I sent you to him: and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	16	I will chastise him therefore and release him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	17	Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	18	But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	19	Who, for a certain sedition made in the city and for a murder, was cast into prison.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	20	And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	21	But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, Crucify him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	22	And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore and let him go.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	23	But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	25	And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition had been cast into prison, whom they had desired. But Jesus he delivered up to their will.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	26	And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	27	And there followed him a great multitude of people and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	28	But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves and for your children.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	29	For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren and the wombs that have not borne and the paps that have not given suck.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us. And to the hills: Cover us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	31	For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	32	And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	33	And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there: and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	34	And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others: let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	37	And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	38	And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	39	And one of those robbers who were hanged blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	40	But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing; thou art under the same condemnation?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	41	And we indeed justly: for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done no evil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	42	And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	43	And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee: This day thou shalt be with me in paradise. In paradise.... That is, in the happy state of rest, joy, and peace everlasting. Christ was pleased, by a special privilege, to reward the faith and confession of the penitent thief, with a full discharge of all his sins, both as to the guilt and punishment; and to introduce him immediately after death into the happy society of the saints, whose limbo, that is, the place of their confinement, was now made a paradise by our Lord’s going thither.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	44	And it was almost the sixth hour: and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	46	And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	47	Now, the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	48	And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight and saw the things that were done returned, striking their breasts.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	49	And all his acquaintance and the women that had followed him from Galilee stood afar off, beholding these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	50	And behold there was a man named Joseph who was a counsellor, a good and a just man,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	51	(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings) of Arimathea, a city of Judea: who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	52	This man went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	53	And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	54	And it was the day of the Parasceve: and the sabbath drew on. Parasceve.... That is, the eve, or day of preparation for the sabbath.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	55	And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre and how his body was laid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	23	56	And returning, they prepared spices and ointments: and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment. Luke Chapter 24 Christ’s resurrection and manifestation of himself to his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	1	And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	2	And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	3	And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	4	And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	5	And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	6	He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in Galilee,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	7	Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	8	And they remembered his words.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	9	And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	10	And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	11	And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not believe them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	12	But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	13	And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	15	And it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also, drawing near, went with them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	16	But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	17	And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk and are sad?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	18	And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	19	To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	20	And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	21	But we hoped that it was he that should have redeemed Israel. And now besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	22	Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us who, before it was light, were at the sepulchre,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	23	And not finding his body, came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	24	And some of our people went to the sepulchre and found it so as the women had said: but him they found not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	25	Then he said to them: O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all things, Which the prophets have spoken.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so, to enter into his glory?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things that were concerning him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	28	And they drew nigh to the town whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	29	But they constrained him, saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	30	And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread and blessed and brake and gave to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	31	And their eyes were opened: and they knew him. And he vanished out of their sight.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	32	And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the scriptures?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	33	And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	34	Saying: The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	35	And they told what things were done in the way: and how they knew him in the breaking of bread.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	36	Now, whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them and saith to them: Peace be to you. It is I: Fear not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	37	But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	38	And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	39	See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	40	And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	41	But while they yet believed not and wondered for joy, he said: Have you here any thing to eat?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	42	And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	43	And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	44	And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms, concerning me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	45	Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	46	And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead, the third day:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	47	And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	48	And you are witnesses of these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	49	And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high. The promise of my Father.... that is, the Holy Ghost, whom Christ had promised that his Father and he would send, John 14. 26, and 17. 7.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	50	And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	51	And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them and was carried up to heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	52	And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	24	53	And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN St. John the Apostle and Evangelist was the son of Zebedee and Salome, brother to James the Greater. He was called the Beloved disciple of Christ and stood by at his Crucifixion. He wrote the Gospel after the other Evangelists, about sixty-three years after our Lord’s Ascension. Many things that they had omitted were supplied by him. The original was written in Greek; and by the Greeks he is titled: The Divine. St. Jerome relates that, when he was earnestly requested by the brethren to write the Gospel, he answered he would do it, if by ordering a common fast, they would all put up their prayers together to the Almighty God; which being ended replenished with the clearest and fullest revelation coming from Heaven, he burst forth into that preface: IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. John Chapter 1 The divinity and incarnation of Christ. John bears witness of him. He begins to call his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	1	In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God: and the Word was God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	3	All things were made by him: and without him was made nothing that was made.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	4	In him was life: and the life was the light of men.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	5	And the light shineth in darkness: and the darkness did not comprehend it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	6	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	7	This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	8	He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	9	That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	10	He was in the world: and the world was made by him: and the world knew him not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	11	He came unto his own: and his own received him not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	12	But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	13	Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	14	And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	15	John beareth witness of him and crieth out, saying: This was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me is preferred before me: because he was before me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	16	And of his fulness we all have received: and grace for grace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	17	For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son who is in the Bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	19	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art thou?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	20	And he confessed and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	21	And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	22	They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	23	He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	24	And they that were sent were of the Pharisees.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	25	And they asked him and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	26	John answered them, saying: I baptize with water: but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	27	The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	28	These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	29	The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him; and he saith: Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	30	This is he of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	31	And I knew him not: but that he may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	32	And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven; and he remained upon him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	33	And I knew him not: but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	34	And I saw: and I gave testimony that this is the Son of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	35	The next day again John stood and two of his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	36	And beholding Jesus walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak: and they followed Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	38	And Jesus turning and seeing them following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him: Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	39	He saith to them: Come and see. They came and saw where he abode: and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about the tenth hour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	40	And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard of John and followed him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	41	He findeth first his brother Simon and saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona. Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	43	On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee: and he findeth Philip, And Jesus saith to him: follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him: We have found him of whom Moses, in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	46	And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and he saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	48	Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	49	Nathanael answered him and said: Rabbi: Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	1	51	And he saith to him: Amen, amen, I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. John Chapter 2 Christ changes water into wine. He casts the sellers out of the temple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	1	And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	2	And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	3	And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	4	And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? My hour is not yet come. What is that to me, etc.... These words of our Saviour, spoken to his mother, have been understood by some commentators as harsh, they not considering the next following verse: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye, which plainly shows that his mother knew of the miracle that he was to perform, and that it was at her request he wrought it; besides the manner of speaking the words as to the tone, and the countenance shown at the same time, which could only be known to those who were present, or from what had followed: for words indicating anger in one tone of voice, would be understood quite the reverse in another.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	5	His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	6	Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	7	Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	8	And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	9	And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water: the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	10	And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	12	After this, he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	13	And the pasch of the Jews was at hand: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	14	And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	15	And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen: and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	16	And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	17	And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	18	The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	19	Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple; and in three days I will raise it up.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	20	The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	21	But he spoke of the temple of his body.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	22	When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this: and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had said.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	23	Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	24	But Jesus did not trust himself unto them: for that he knew all men,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	2	25	And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man. John Chapter 3 Christ’s discourse with Nicodemus. John’s testimony.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	1	And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	2	This man came to Jesus by night and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	4	Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born again?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	5	Jesus answered: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Unless a man be born again, etc.... By these words our Saviour hath declared the necessity of baptism; and by the word water it is evident that the application of it is necessary with the words. Matt. 28. 19.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	7	Wonder not that I said to thee: You must be born again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	8	The Spirit breatheth where he will and thou hearest his voice: but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be done?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him: Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	11	Amen, amen, I say to thee that we speak what we know and we testify what we have seen: and you receive not our testimony.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	12	If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not: how will you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	13	And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	15	That whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	16	For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son: that whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	17	For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world: but that the world may be saved by him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	18	He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Is not judged.... He that believeth, viz., by a faith working through charity, is not judged, that is, is not condemned; but the obstinate unbeliever is judged, that is, condemned already, by retrenching himself from the society of Christ and his church.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	19	And this is the judgment: Because the light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil. The judgment.... That is, the cause of his comdemnation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	20	For every one that doth evil hateth the light and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	21	But he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest: because they are done in God. He that doth truth.... that is, he that acteth according to truth, which here signifies the Law of God. Thy law is truth. Psa. 118. 142.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	22	After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them and baptized.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	23	And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim: because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	25	And there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews, concerning purification.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	26	And they came to John and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony: behold, he baptizeth and all men come to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	27	John answered and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	28	You yourselves do bear me witness that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	30	He must increase: but I must decrease.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	31	He that cometh from above is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven is above all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	32	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	35	The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	3	36	He that believeth in the Son hath life everlasting: but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him. John Chapter 4 Christ talks with the Samaritan woman. He heals the ruler’s son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	1	When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples and baptizeth more than John,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	2	(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples),	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	3	He left Judea and went again into Galilee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	4	And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	5	He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	6	Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	7	There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	8	For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	9	Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew; ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God and who he is that saith to thee: Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	11	The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou living water?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof, himself and his children and his cattle?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	14	But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	15	The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	16	Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	17	The woman answered and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well: I have no husband.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	18	For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This, thou hast said truly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	19	The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	20	Our fathers adored on this mountain: and you say that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore. This mountain.... Garizim, where the Samaritans had their schismatical temple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	21	Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	22	You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know. For salvation is of the Jews.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	23	But the hour cometh and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	24	God is a spirit: and they that adore him must adore him in spirit and in truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	25	The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ): therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	26	Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	27	And immediately his disciples came. And they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? Or: Why talkest thou with her?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	28	The woman therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men there:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	29	Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	30	They went therefore out of the city and came unto him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	31	In the mean time, the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	32	But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you know not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	33	The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	34	Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	35	Do not you say: There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries. For they are white already to harvest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	37	For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	38	I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour. Others have laboured: and you have entered into their labours.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	39	Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	40	So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	41	And many more believed in him, because of his own word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	42	And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	43	Now after two days, he departed thence and went into Galilee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	44	For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	45	And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day: for they also went to the festival day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	46	He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	47	He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and prayed him to come down and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	48	Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	49	The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	50	Jesus saith to him: Go thy way. Thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	51	And as he was going down, his servants met him: and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	52	He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	53	The father therefore knew that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him: Thy son liveth. And himself believed, and his whole house.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	4	54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee. John Chapter 5 Christ heals on the sabbath the man languishing thirty-eight years. His discourse upon this occasion.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	1	After these things was a festival day of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	2	Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches. Probatica.... That is, the sheep pond; either so called, because the sheep were washed therein, that were to be offered up in sacrifice in the temple, or because it was near the sheep gate. That this was a pond where miracles were wrought is evident from the sacred text; and also that the water had no natural virtue to heal, as one only of those put in after the motion of the water was restored to health; for if the water had the healing quality, the others would have the like benefit, being put into it about the same time.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered: waiting for the moving of the water.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	4	And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	5	And there was a certain man there that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	6	Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	7	The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	8	Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed and walk.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	10	The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	11	He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me: Take up thy bed and walk.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	12	They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee: Take up thy bed and walk?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	13	But he who was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	14	Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	15	The man went his way and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	16	Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	17	But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	18	Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	19	Then Jesus answered and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	22	For neither does the Father judge any man: but hath given all judgment to the Son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	23	That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father who hath sent him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	24	Amen, amen, I say unto you that he who heareth my word and believeth him that sent me hath life everlasting: and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	25	Amen, amen, I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given to the Son also to have life in himself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	27	And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	28	Wonder not at this: for the hour cometh wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	29	And they that have done good things shall come forth unto the resurrection of life: but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. Unto the resurrection of judgment.... That is, condemnation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	30	I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge. And my judgment is just: because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	32	There is another that beareth witness of me: and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	33	You sent to John: and he gave testimony to the truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	34	But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	35	He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	36	But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect, the works themselves which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	37	And the Father himself who hath sent me hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	38	And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	39	Search the scriptures: for you think in them to have life everlasting. And the same are they that give testimony of me. Or.... You search the scriptures. Scrutamini.... It is not a command for all to read the scriptures; but a reproach to the Pharisees, that reading the scriptures as they did, and thinking to find everlasting life in them, they would not receive him to whom all those scriptures gave testimony, and through whom alone they could have that true life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	40	And you will not come to me that you may have life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	41	I receive not glory from men.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	42	But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	43	I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	44	How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	45	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	46	For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also: for he wrote of me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	5	47	But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? John Chapter 6 Christ feeds five thousand with five loaves. He walks upon the sea and discourses of the bread of life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	1	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	3	Jesus therefore went up into a mountain: and there he sat with his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	4	Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	5	When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	6	And this he said to try him: for he himself knew what he would do.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	7	Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one may take a little.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	8	One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	9	There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves and two fishes. But what are these among so many?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	10	Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now, there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	12	And when they were filled, he said to his disciples: gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	13	They gathered up therefore and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above to them that had eaten.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	14	Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet that is to come into the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	15	Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by force and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	16	And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	17	And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the sea to Capharnaum. And it was now dark: and Jesus was not come unto them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	18	And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	19	When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh to the ship. And they were afraid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	20	But he saith to them: It is I. Be not afraid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	21	They were willing therefore to take him into the ship. And presently the ship was at the land to which they were going.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	22	The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other ship there but one: and that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	23	But other ships came in from Tiberias, nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving thanks.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	24	When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they took shipping and came to Capharnaum, seeking for Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	26	Jesus answered them and said: Amen, amen, I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of man will give you. For him hath God, the Father, sealed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	28	They said therefore unto him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he hath sent.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	30	They said therefore to him: What sign therefore dost thou shew that we may see and may believe thee? What dost thou work?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	32	Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say to you; Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	33	For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven and giveth life to the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	34	They said therefore unto him: Lord, give us always this bread.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	35	And Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall not hunger: and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	36	But I said unto you that you also have seen me, and you believe not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	37	All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	38	Because I came down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	39	Now this is the will of the Father who sent me: that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again in the last day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	40	And this is the will of my Father that sent me: that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in him may have life everlasting. And I will raise him up in the last day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	41	The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he had said: I am the living bread which came down from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	42	And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then saith he: I came down from heaven?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	44	No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him. And I will raise him up in the last day. Draw him.... Not by compulsion, nor by laying the free will under any necessity, but by the strong and sweet motions of his heavenly grace.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	45	It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned cometh to me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father: but he who is of God, he hath seen the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	47	Amen, amen, I say unto you: He that believeth in me hath everlasting life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	48	I am the bread of life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	49	Your fathers did eat manna in the desert: and are dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven: that if any man eat of it, he may not die.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	52	If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	53	The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	54	Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. Except you eat—and drink, etc.... To receive the body and blood of Christ, is a divine precept, insinuated in this text; which the faithful fulfil, though they receive but in one kind; because in one kind they receive both body and blood, which cannot be separated from each other. Hence, life eternal is here promised to the worthy receiving, though but in one kind. Ver. 52. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh for the life of the world. Ver. 58. He that eateth me, the same also shall live by me. Ver. 59. He that eateth this bread, shall liver for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	55	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	56	For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	57	He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me: and I in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	58	As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	59	This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	60	These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in Capharnaum.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	61	Many therefore of his disciples, hearing it, said: This saying is hard; and who can hear it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	62	But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them: Doth this scandalize you?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	63	If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? If then you shall see, etc.... Christ by mentioning his ascension, by this instance of his power and divinity, would confirm the truth of what he had before asserted; and at the same time correct their gross apprehension of eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, in a vulgar and carnal manner, by letting them know he should take his whole body living with him to heaven; and consequently not suffer it to be as they supposed, divided, mangled, and consumed upon earth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	64	It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. The flesh profiteth nothing.... Dead flesh separated from the spirit, in the gross manner they supposed they were to eat his flesh, would profit nothing. Neither doth man’s flesh, that is to say, man’s natural and carnal apprehension, (which refuses to be subject to the spirit, and words of Christ,) profit any thing. But it would be the height of blasphemy, to say the living flesh of Christ (which we receive in the blessed sacarament, with his spirit, that is, with his soul and divinity) profiteth nothing. For if Christ’s flesh had profitedus nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in us nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in the flesh for us. Are spirit and life.... By proposing to you a heavenly sacrament, in which you shall receive, in a wonderful manner, spirit, grace, and life, in its very fountain.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	65	But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who he was that would betray him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	66	And he said: Therefore did I say to you that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	67	After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	68	Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	69	And Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	70	And we have believed and have known that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	71	Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve? And one of you is a devil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	6	72	Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the twelve. John Chapter 7 Christ goes up to the feast of the tabernacles. He teaches in the temple.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	1	After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	2	Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	3	And his brethren said to, him: Pass from hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	4	For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	5	For neither did his brethren believe in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	6	Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	7	The world cannot hate you: but me it hateth, because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	8	Go you up to this festival day: but I go not up to this festival day, because my time is not accomplished.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	9	When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	10	But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	11	The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day and said: Where is he?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	13	Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	14	Now, about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	15	And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	16	Jesus answered them and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	17	If any man will do the will of him, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	18	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true and there is no injustice in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	19	Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	20	Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a devil. Who seeketh to kill thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	21	Jesus answered and said to them: One work I have done: and you all wonder.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	22	Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers): and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	23	If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken: are you angry at me, because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	24	Judge not according to the appearance: but judge just judgment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	25	Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	26	And behold, he speaketh openly: and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth that this is the Christ?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	27	But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth, whence he is.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	28	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am. And I am not come of myself: but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	29	I know him, because I am from him: and he hath sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	30	They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	31	But of the people many believed in him and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles than this man doth?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	32	The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	33	Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	34	You shall seek me and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	35	The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	36	What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me and shall not find me? And: Where I am, you cannot come?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	37	And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	38	He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith: Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	39	Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	40	Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	41	Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	42	Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David and from Bethlehem the town where David was?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	43	So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	44	And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands upon him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	45	The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	46	The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	47	The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	48	Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	49	But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	50	Nicodemus said to them (he that came to him by night, who was one of them):	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	51	Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him and know what he doth?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	52	They answered and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	7	53	And every man returned to his own house. John Chapter 8 The woman taken in adultery. Christ justifies his doctrine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	1	And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple: and all the people came to him. And sitting down he taught them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	3	And the scribes and Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	4	And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	5	Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	6	And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	7	When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	8	And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	9	But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	10	Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	11	Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	12	Again therefore, Jesus spoke to: them, saying: I am the light of the world. He that followeth me walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself. Thy testimony is not true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	15	You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	16	And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	17	And in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	18	I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	19	They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father. If you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	20	These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	21	Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go: and you shall seek me. And you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	22	The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go you cannot come?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	23	And he said to them: You are from beneath: I am from above. You are of this world: I am not of this world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	24	Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	25	They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	26	Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	27	And they understood not that he called God his Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	28	Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up, the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself. But as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	29	And he that sent me is with me: and he hath not left me alone. For I do always the things that please him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	30	When he spoke these things, many believed in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	32	And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	33	They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham: and we have never been slaves to any man. How sayest thou: You shall be free?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	34	Jesus answered them: Amen, amen, I say unto you that whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	35	Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the son abideth for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	36	If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	37	I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	39	They answered and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	40	But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	41	You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	42	Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded and came. For I came not of myself: but he sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	43	Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	44	You are of your father the devil: and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning: and he stood not in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	45	But if I say the truth, you believe me not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	46	Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	47	He that is of God heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	48	The Jews therefore answered and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a devil?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	49	Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father. And you have dishonoured me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	50	But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	51	Amen, amen, I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	52	The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets: and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	54	Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	55	And you have not known him: but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him and do keep his word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	56	Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it and was glad.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	57	The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old. And hast thou seen Abraham?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	58	Jesus said to them: Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I AM.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	8	59	They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. John Chapter 9 He gives sight to the man born blind.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	1	And Jesus passing by, saw a man who was blind from his birth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	2	And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	3	Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	4	I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	6	When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	7	And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed: and he came seeing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	8	The neighbours, therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	9	But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	10	They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	11	He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe and wash. And I went: I washed: and I see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	12	And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	13	They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	14	Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	15	Again therefore the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes: and I washed: and I see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	16	Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	17	They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	18	The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	19	And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	20	His parents answered them and said: We know that this is our son and that he was born blind:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	21	But how he now seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, we know not. Ask himself: he is of age: Let him speak for himself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	22	These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	23	Therefore did his parents say: He is of age. Ask himself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	24	They therefore called the man again that had been blind and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	25	He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not. One thing I know, that whereas I was blind. now I see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	26	They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	27	He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard. Why would you hear it again? Will you also become his disciples?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	28	They reviled him therefore and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	30	The man answered and said to them: why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	31	Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God and doth his, will, him he heareth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	32	From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	33	Unless this man were of God, he could not do anything.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	34	They answered and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins; and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	36	He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	37	And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	38	And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	39	And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world: that they who see not may see; and they who see may become blind. I am come, etc.... Not that Christ came for that end, that any one should be made blind: but that the Jews, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this judgment of blindness.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	40	And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	9	41	Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth. If you were blind, etc.... If you were invincibly ignorant, and had neither read the scriptures, nor seen my miracles, you would not be guilty of the sin of infidelity: but now, as you boast of your knowledge of the scriptures, you are inexcusable. John Chapter 10 Christ is the door and the good shepherd. He and his Father are one.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	1	Amen, amen, I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	3	To him the porter openeth: and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	4	And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	5	But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	6	This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	7	Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	8	All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	9	I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in and go out, and shall find pastures.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	10	The thief cometh not, but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	11	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	12	But the hireling and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth: and the wolf catcheth and scattereth the sheep,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	13	And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	14	I am the good shepherd: and I know mine, and mine know me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	15	As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	16	And other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice: And there shall be one fold and one shepherd.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	17	Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	18	No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself. And I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	19	A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	20	And many of them said: He hath a devil and is mad. Why hear you him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	21	Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	22	And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	24	The Jews therefore came round about him and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	25	Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	26	But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	27	My sheep hear my voice. And I know them: and they follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	28	And I give them life everlasting: and they shall not perish for ever. And no man shall pluck them out of my hand.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	29	That which my Father hath given me is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	30	I and the Father are one. I and the Father are one.... That is, one divine nature, but two distinct persons.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	31	The Jews then took up stones to stone him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	32	Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	33	The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy: and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	34	Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said, you are gods?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	35	If he called them gods to whom the word of God was spoken; and the scripture cannot be broken:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	36	Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest; because I said: I am the Son of God?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	38	But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	39	They sought therefore to take him: and he escaped out of their hands.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	40	And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first. And there he abode.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	41	And many resorted to him: and they said: John indeed did no sign.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	10	42	But all things whatsoever John said of this man were true. And many believed in him. John Chapter 11 Christ raises Lazarus to life. The rulers resolve to put him to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	1	Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and of Martha her sister.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	2	(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	3	His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	4	And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary and Lazarus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	7	Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	8	The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee. And goest thou thither again?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	9	Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	10	But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	11	These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth: but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	12	His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	13	But Jesus spoke of his death: and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	14	Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	15	And I am glad, for your sakes; that I was not there, that you may believe. But, let us go to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	16	Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	17	Jesus therefore came: and found that he had been four days already in the grave.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	18	(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	19	And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	20	Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus was come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	21	Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	22	But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	23	Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	24	Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	25	Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	26	And every one that liveth and believeth in me shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	27	She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	28	And when she had said these things, she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come and calleth for thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	29	She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly and cometh to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	30	For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	31	The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	32	When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet and saith to him. Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	33	Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her weeping, groaned in the spirit and troubled himself,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	34	And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	35	And Jesus wept.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	36	The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	37	But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind have caused that this man should not die?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	39	Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	40	Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	41	They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes, said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	42	And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	43	When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	44	And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands. And his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him and let him go.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	45	Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	47	The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	48	If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	49	But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	50	Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	51	And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	52	And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God that were dispersed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	53	From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	54	Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews: but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem. And there he abode with his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	55	And the pasch of the Jews was at hand: and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch, to purify themselves.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	11	56	They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment that, if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him. John Chapter 12 The anointing of Christ’s feet. His riding into Jerusalem upon an ass. A voice from heaven.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	1	Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	2	And they made him a supper there: and Martha served. But Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	3	Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	4	Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	6	Now he said this not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief and, having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	7	Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	8	For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always. See the annotation of St. Matt. 26. 11.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	9	A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	10	But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	11	Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away and believed in Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	12	And on the next day, a great multitude that was come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	13	Took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried Hosanna. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	14	And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it, as it is written:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	15	Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold thy king cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	16	These things his disciples did not know at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him and that they had done these things to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	17	The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	18	For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? Behold, the whole world is gone after him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	20	Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	21	These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	23	But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	24	Amen, amen, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	25	Itself remaineth alone. But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world keepeth it unto life eternal.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	26	If any man minister to me, let him follow me: and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	27	Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	28	Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	29	The multitude therefore that stood and heard said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	30	Jesus answered and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	31	Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	33	(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	34	The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever. And how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	35	Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	36	Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke: and he went away and hid himself from them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	37	And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	38	That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	39	Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again: They could not believe.... Because they would not, saith St. Augustine, Tract. 33, in Joan. See the annotation, St. Mark 4. 12.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	40	He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart and be converted: and I should heal them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	41	These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	42	However, many of the chief men also believed in him: but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	43	For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	44	But Jesus cried and said: He that believeth in me doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	45	And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	46	I am come, a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in me may not remain in darkness.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	47	And if any man hear my words and keep them not, I do not judge him for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	48	He that despiseth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	49	For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say and what I should speak.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak. John Chapter 13 Christ washes his disciples’ feet. The treason of Judas. The new commandment of love.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	1	Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end. Before the festival day of the pasch.... This was the fourth and last pasch of the ministry of Christ, and according to the common computation, was in the thirty-third year of our Lord: and in the year of the world 4036. Some chronologers are of opinion that our Saviour suffered in the thirty-seventh year of his age: but these different opinions on this subject are of no consequence.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	2	And when supper was done (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him),	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	3	Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands and that he came from God and goeth to God,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	4	He riseth from supper and layeth aside his garments and, having taken a towel, girded himself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	5	After that, he putteth water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	6	He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him: What I do, thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	8	Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet, Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	9	Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	10	Jesus saith to him: He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	11	For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	12	Then after he had washed their feet and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	13	You call me Master and Lord. And you say well: for so I am.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	14	If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another’s feet.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	15	For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	16	Amen, amen, I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord: neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	17	If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	18	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his heel against me,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	19	At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	20	Amen, amen, I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me: and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	21	When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you shall betray me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	22	The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	23	Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	25	He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	26	Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	27	And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly. That which thou dost, do quickly.... It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treason: but a signification to him that Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleased: but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our redemption.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	28	Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	29	For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	30	He therefore, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	31	When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified; and God is glorified in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	32	If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself: and immediately will he glorify him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	33	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me. And as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	35	By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	36	Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now: but thou shalt follow hereafter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	37	Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	13	38	Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen, I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice. John Chapter 14 Christ’s discourse after his last supper.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	1	Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God: believe also in me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	2	In my Father’s house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	3	And if I shall go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself: that where I am, you also may be.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	4	And whither I go you know: and the way you know.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	5	Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest. And how can we know the way?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	6	Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	7	If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him. And you have seen him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	8	Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father; and it is enough for us.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	9	Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou: Shew us the Father?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	11	Believe you not that I am in the Father and the Father in me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	12	Otherwise believe for the very works’ sake. Amen, amen, I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do: and greater than these shall he do.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	13	Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	14	If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	15	If you love me, keep my commandments.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	16	And I will ask the Father: and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever: Paraclete.... That is, a comforter: or also an advocate; inasmuch as by inspiring prayer, he prays, as it were, in us, and pleads for us. For ever.... Hence it is evident that this Spirit of Truth was not only promised to the persons of the apostles, but also to their successors through all generations.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	17	The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him. But you shall know him; because he shall abide with you and shall be in you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	18	I will not leave you orphans: I will come to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	19	Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	20	In that day you shall know that I am in my Father: and you in me, and I in you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	21	He that hath my commandments and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	22	Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word. And my Father will love him and we will come to him and will make our abode with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard is not mine; but the Father’s who sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	25	These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	26	But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you. Teach you all things.... Here the Holy Ghost is promised to the apostles and their successors, particularly, in order to teach them all truth, and to preserve them from error.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	27	Peace I leave with you: my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled: nor let it be afraid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	28	You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I. For the Father is greater than I.... It is evident, that Christ our Lord speaks here of himself as he is made man: for as God he is equal to the Father. (See Phil. 2.) Any difficulty of understanding the meaning of these words will vanish, when the relative circumstances of the text here are considered: for Christ being at this time shortly to suffer death, signified to his apostles his human nature by these very words: for as God he could not die. And therefore as he was both God and man, it must follow that according to his humanity he was to die, which the apostles were soon to see and believe, as he expresses, ver. 29. And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	29	And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	30	I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world: cometh: and in me he hath not any thing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	14	31	But that the world may know that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I. Arise, let us go hence. John Chapter 15 A continuation of Christ’s discourse to his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	1	I am the true vine: and my Father is the husbandman.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	3	Now you are clean, by reason of the word which I have spoken to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	4	Abide in me: and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	5	I am the vine: you the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	6	If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch and shall wither: and they shall gather him up and cast him into the fire: and he burneth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	7	If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will: and it shall be done unto you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	8	In this is my Father glorified: that you bring forth very much fruit and become my disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	9	As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	10	If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love: as I also have kept my Father’s commandments and do abide in his love.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	11	These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	12	This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	13	Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	14	You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	15	I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all things, whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	16	You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	17	These things I command you, that you love one another.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	18	If the world hate you, know ye that it hath hated me before you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	19	If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	20	Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	21	But all these things they will do to you for my name’s sake: because they know not him that sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	24	If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	25	But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: they hated me without cause.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	26	But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me. Whom I will send.... This proves, against the modern Greeks, that the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Son, as well as from the Father: otherwise he could not be sent by the Son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	15	27	And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning. John Chapter 16 The conclusion of Christ’s last discourse to his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	1	These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	2	They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a service to God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	3	And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father nor me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	4	But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	5	But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	6	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	7	But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go. For if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you: but if I go, I will send him to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	8	And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin and of justice and of judgment. He will convince the world of sin, etc.... The Holy Ghost, by his coming brought over many thousands, first, to a sense of their sin in not believing in Christ. Secondly, to a conviction of the justice of Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his Father. And thirdly, to a right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to follow Satan, who is already judged and condemned.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	9	Of sin: because they believed not in me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	10	And of justice: because I go to the Father: and you shall see me no longer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	11	And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	12	I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	13	But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself: but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak. And the things that are to come, he shall shew you. Will teach you all truth.... See the annotation on chap. 14. ver. 26.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	14	He shall glorify me: because he shall receive of mine and shall shew it to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	15	All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine. Therefore I said that he shall receive of me and shew it to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	16	A little while, and now you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	17	Then some of his disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, Because I go to the Father?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	18	They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he speaketh.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	19	And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him. And he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	20	Amen, amen, I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	21	A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	22	So also you now indeed have sorrow: but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice. And your joy no man shall take from you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	23	And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen, I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	24	Hitherto, you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	25	These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	26	In that day, you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you that I will ask the Father for you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	27	For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	28	I came forth from the Father and am come into the world: again I leave the world and I go to the Father.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	29	His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly and speakest no proverb.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	30	Now we know that thou knowest all things and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	31	Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	32	Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	16	33	These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress. But have confidence. I have overcome the world. John Chapter 17 Christ’s prayer for his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	1	These things Jesus spoke: and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	2	As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	3	Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	4	I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	5	And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	6	I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were: and to me thou gavest them. And they have kept thy word.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	7	Now they have known that all things which thou hast given me are from thee:	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	8	Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them. And they have received them and have known in very deed that I came out from thee: and they have believed that thou didst send me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	9	I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	10	And all my things are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	11	And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou hast given me: that they may be one, as we also are.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	12	While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept: and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition: that the scripture may be fulfilled.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	13	And now I come to thee: and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	14	I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them: because they are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	15	I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	16	They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	17	Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	18	As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	19	And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	20	And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	21	That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	22	And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them: that, they may be one, as we also are one.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	23	I in them, and thou in me: that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	24	Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me: that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	25	Just Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee. And these have known that thou hast sent me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	17	26	And I have made known thy name to them and will make it known: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. John Chapter 18 The history of the passion of Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	1	When Jesus had said these things, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	2	And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	3	Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	4	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth and said to them: Whom seek ye?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	5	They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	6	As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward and fell to the ground.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	7	Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said: Jesus of Nazareth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	8	Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	9	That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	10	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	11	Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	12	Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took Jesus and bound him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	13	And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	14	Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus: and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	16	But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the portress and brought in Peter.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	17	The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith: I am not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	18	Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing and warming himself.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	20	Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort: and in secret I have spoken nothing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	21	Why askest thou me? Ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them. Behold they know what things I have said.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	22	And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	23	Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	24	And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	25	And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it and said: I am not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did not I see thee in the garden with him?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	27	Again therefore Peter denied: and immediately the cock crew.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	28	Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor’s hall. And it was morning: and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	29	Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	30	They answered and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	31	Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	32	That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	33	Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called Jesus and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	34	Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	35	Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me. What hast thou done?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	36	Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	37	Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	38	Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews and saith to them: I find no cause in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	39	But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the Pasch. Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	18	40	Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. John Chapter 19 The continuation of the history of the Passion of Christ.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	1	Then therefore Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	2	And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head: and they put on him a purple garment.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	3	And they came to him and said: Hail, king of the Jews. And they gave him blows.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	4	Pilate therefore went forth again and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	5	(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	6	When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, Crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	7	The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	8	When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	9	And he entered into the hall again; and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	10	Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	11	Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	12	And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	13	Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	14	And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king. The parasceve of the pasch.... That is, the day before the paschal sabbath. The eve of every sabbath was called the parasceve, or day of preparation. But this was the eve of a high sabbath, viz., that which fell in the paschal week.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	15	But they cried out: Away with him: Away with him: Crucify him. Pilate saith to them: shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	16	Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him forth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	17	And bearing his own cross, he went forth to the place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	18	Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title also: and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	20	This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not: The King of the Jews. But that he said: I am the King of the Jews.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	22	Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	23	The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	24	They said then one to another: Let us not cut it but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lots. And the soldiers indeed did these things.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	26	When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	27	After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	28	Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	29	Now there was a vessel set there, full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to his mouth.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	30	Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	31	Then the Jews (because it was the parasceve), that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day (for that was a great sabbath day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken: and that they might be taken away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	32	The soldiers therefore came: and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	33	But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	34	But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side: and immediately there came out blood and water.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	35	And he that saw it hath given testimony: and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true: that you also may believe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	36	For these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	37	And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	38	And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews), besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave leave. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	39	And Nicodemus also came (he who at the first came to Jesus by night), bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	40	They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	41	Now there was in the place where he was crucified a garden: and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	19	42	There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus: because the sepulchre was nigh at hand. John Chapter 20 Christ’s resurrection and manifestation to his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	1	And on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre: and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	2	She ran therefore and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre: and we know not where they have laid him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	3	Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple: and they came to the sepulchre.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	4	And they both ran together: and that other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the sepulchre.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	5	And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying: but yet he went not in.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	6	Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre: and saw the linen cloths lying,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	7	And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	8	Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw and believed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	10	The disciples therefore departed again to their home.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	11	But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre,	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	12	And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	13	They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord: and I know not where they have laid him.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	14	When she had thus said, she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing: and she knew not that it was Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	15	Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him: and I will take him away.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	16	Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	17	Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me: for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and to your God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	18	Mary Magdalen cometh and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord; and these things he said to me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	19	Now when it was late the same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them: Peace be to you. The doors were shut.... The same power which could bring Christ’s whole body, entire in all its dimensions, through the doors, can without the least question make the same body really present in the sacrament; though both the one and the other be above our comprehension.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	20	And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	21	He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	22	When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	23	Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them: and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. Whose sins, etc.... See here the commission, stamped by the broad seal of heaven, by virtue of which the pastors of Christ’s church absolve repenting sinners upon their confession.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	24	Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	25	The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the place of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	26	And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said: Peace be to you.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	27	Then he said to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither and see my hands. And bring hither thy hand and put it into my side. And be not faithless, but believing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	28	Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord and my God.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	29	Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen and have believed.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	30	Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	20	31	But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name. John Chapter 21 Christ manifests himself to his disciples by the sea side and gives Peter the charge of his sheep.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	1	After this, Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	2	There were together: Simon Peter and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	3	Simon Peter saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	4	But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	5	Jesus therefore said to them: Children, have you any meat? They answered him: No.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	6	He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship; and you shall find. They cast therefore: and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	8	But the other disciples came in the ship (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	9	As soon then as they came to land they saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	10	Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	12	Jesus saith to them: Come and dine. And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? Knowing that it was the Lord.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	13	And Jesus cometh and taketh bread and giveth them: and fish in like manner.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	15	When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	16	He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	17	He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep. Feed my sheep.... Our Lord had promised the spiritual supremacy to St. Peter; St. Matt. 16. 19; and here he fulfils that promise, by charging him with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his own church.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	18	Amen, amen, I say to thee, When thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself and didst walk where thou wouldst. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and lead thee whither thou wouldst not.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	19	And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	20	Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper and said: Lord, who is he that shall betray thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	21	Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	22	Jesus saith to him: So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	23	This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him: He should not die; but: So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	24	This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things and hath written these things: and we know that his testimony is true.	8
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE	21	25	But there are also many other things which Jesus did which, if they were written every one, the world itself. I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.	8
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the word of life.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	2	For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and hath appeared to us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	3	That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	4	And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy may be full.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	5	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and declare unto you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his word is not in us. 1 John Chapter 2 Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love one another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but abide by the spirit of God in the church.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	1	My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	3	And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. We have known him, if we keep his commandments.... He speaks of that practical knowledge by love and affection, which can only be proved by our keeping his commandments; and without which we can not be said to know God as we should do.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	4	He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar: and the truth is not in him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	5	But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected. And by this we know that we are in him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	7	Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	8	Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both in him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth. A new commandment.... Viz., the commandment of love, which was first given in the old law; but was renewed and extended by Christ. See John 13.34.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no scandal in him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	13	I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	14	I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	15	Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	16	For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	17	And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	18	Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. It is the last hour.... That is, it is the last age of the world. Many Antichrists; ... that is, many heretics, enemies of Christ and his church, and forerunners of the great Antichrist.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	19	They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. They were not of us.... That is, they were not solid, steadfast, genuine Christians: otherwise they would have remained in the church.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	20	But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things. The unction from the Holy One.... That is, grace and wisdom from the Holy Ghost. Know all things.... The true children of God’s church, remaining in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the grace of the Holy Ghost, promised to the church and her pastors; and have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction; so as to have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that society of which they are members.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	21	I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	22	Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	24	As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	25	And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	26	These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	27	And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. You have no need, etc.... You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost; which these new teachers have no share in.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	28	And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	29	If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth justice is born of him. 1 John Chapter 3 Of the love of God to us. How we may distinguish the children of God and those of the devil. Of loving one another and of purity of conscience.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	1	Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	2	Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	3	And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is iniquity. Iniquity.... transgression of the law.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	5	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him there is no sin.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath not seen him nor known him. Sinneth not.... viz., mortally. See chap. 1.8.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	9	Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God. Committeth not sin.... That is, as long as he keepeth in himself this seed of grace, and this divine generation, by which he is born of God. But then he may fall from this happy state, by the abuse of his free will, as appears from Rom. 11.20-22; Cor. 9.27; and 10.12; Phil. 2.12; Apoc. 3.11.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	11	For this is the declaration which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother’s just.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	13	Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	16	In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	17	He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	19	In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall persuade our hearts.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	20	For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	21	Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	22	And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	23	And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us. 1 John Chapter 4 What spirits are of God, and what are not. We must love one another, because God has loved us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	1	Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Try the spirits.... Viz., by examining whether their teaching be agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) He that knoweth God, heareth us [the pastors of the church]. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	2	By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: Every spirit which confesseth, etc.... Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient; but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	3	And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world. That dissolveth Jesus.... Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his divinity. He is now already in the world.... Not in his person, but in his spirit, and in his precursors.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	5	They are of the world. Therefore of the world they speak: and the world heareth them.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	6	We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	7	Dearly beloved, let us love one another: for charity is of God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God: for God is charity.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	9	By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	10	In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	11	My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	13	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	16	And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	17	In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	18	Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth is not perfected in charity. Fear is not in charity, etc.... Perfect charity, or love, banisheth human fear, that is, the fear of men; as also all perplexing fear, which makes men mistrust or despair of God’s mercy; and that kind of servile fear, which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of God’s judgments, so often recomended in holy writ; nor that fear and trembling, with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2.12.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	19	Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	20	If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	21	And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother. 1 John Chapter 5 Of them that are born of God, and of true charity. Faith overcomes the world. Three that bear witness to Christ. Of faith in his name and of sin that is and is not to death.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. Is born of God.... That is, is justified, and become a child of God by baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere disposition to keep God’s holy law and commandments.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	2	In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	3	For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not heavy.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory which overcometh the world: Our faith. Our faith.... Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a faith that worketh by charity. Gal. 5.6	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ is the truth. Came by water and blood.... Not only to wash away our sins by the water of baptism, but by his own blood.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	7	And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	8	And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three are one. The spirit, and the water, and the blood.... As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ’s divinity; so the spirit, which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his humanity, and are one; that is, all agree in one testimony.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. He that believeth not the Son, etc.... By refusing to believe the testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal life is obtained and promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this lively confidence, that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in the manner we ought. And this we know, and have experience of, by having obtained the petitions that we have made.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	11	And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not life.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	13	These things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life: you who believe in the name of the Son of God.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	14	And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	15	And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	16	He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death. For that I say not that any man ask. A sin which is not to death, etc.... It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin which is not to death, and a sin which is unto death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that is not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is unto death, and adds these words, for that I say not that any man ask, it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any man ask the remission: that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures, that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men’s sins be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault. A sin unto death.... Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	17	All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	19	We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in wickedness. And the whole world is seated in wickedness.... That is, a great part of the world. It may also signify, is under the wicked one, meaning the devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all the wicked. John 12.31.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. And may be in his true Son. He is, or this is the true God, and life eternal.... Which words are a clear proof of Christ’s divinity, and as such made use of by the ancient fathers.	9
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. Keep yourselves from idols.... An admonition to the newly converted Christians, lest conversing with heathens and idolaters, they might fall back into the sin of idolatry, which may be the sin unto death here mentioned by St. John.	9
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	1	1	Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence:	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	1	4	Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	1	5	Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the council of the just.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	1	6	For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalms Chapter 2 Quare fremuerunt. The vain efforts of persecutors against Christ and his church.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	2	1	Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	2	2	The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	3	1	The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	3	2	Why, O Lord, are they multipied that afflict me? many are they who rise up against me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	3	3	Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	3	4	But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	4	1	Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David. Unto the end.... Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.—Ibid. In verses, in carminibus.... In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.—Ibid. For David, or to David.... That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	4	5	Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	4	6	Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who sheweth us good things?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	4	7	The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	6	1	Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave. For the octave.... That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	8	And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	10	The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	11	Just is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	12	God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	15	Behold he hath been in labour with injustice: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	16	He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into the hole he made.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	7	17	His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	8	5	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	8	6	Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	8	7	And hast set him over the works of thy hands.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	8	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover, the beasts also of the fields.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	1	Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David. The hidden things of the Son....

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	4	When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	5	For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	6	Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	7	The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	8	But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	9	And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	10	And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	17	The Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	18	The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	19	For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	20	Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	9	21	Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men. Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible. Psalm 10 according to the Hebrews. 9a:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble? 9a:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. 9a:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. 9a:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him: 9a:5. God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. 9a:6. For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. 9a:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. 9a:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may kill the innocent. 9a:9. His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. 9a:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. 9a:11. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end. 9a:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. 9a:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. 9a:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. 9a:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. 9a:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. 9a:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. 9a:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth. Psalms Chapter 10 In Domino confido. The just man’s confidence in God in the midst of persecutions.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	10	7	He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	12	3	How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?	10

The general corruption of man before our redemption by Christ.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	13	2	The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	13	3	They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good: no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps is under their lips.

Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	13	4	Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	13	5	They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	15	1	The inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee. The inscription of a title....

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	15	3	To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	16	9	From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	16	10	They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly. Their fat.... That is, their bowels of compassion: for they have none for me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	16	11	They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	16	14	From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance. Divide them from the few, etc.... That is, cut them off from the earth, and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so proud of, or divide them from the few; that is, from thy elect, who are but few; that they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them.

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	3	The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector, and the horn of my salvation, and my support.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	17	He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many waters.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	18	He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	19	They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the Lord became my protector.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	20	And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	17	21	And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	43	19	And our heart hath not turned back: neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	43	20	For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the shadow of death hath covered us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	43	21	If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god:	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	5	I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	6	Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me. The iniquity of my heel.... That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	7	They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches, They that trust, etc.... As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	8	No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to God his ransom,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	9	Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever, And shall labour for ever, etc.... This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	10	And shall still live unto the end.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	11	He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers: He shall not see destruction, etc.... Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	12	And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names. They have called, etc.... That is, they have left their names on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	13	And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	14	This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth. They shall delight in their mouth.... Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and glory in their doings.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	15	They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory. In the morning.... That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the just shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid. From their glory.... That is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no more.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	16	But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	17	Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	18	For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	19	For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	48	20	He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: and he shall never see light.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	13	Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	14	Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the most High.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	15	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	16	But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	17	Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	18	If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou hast been a partaker.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	19	Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	20	Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a scandal against thy mother’s son:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	21	These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set before thy face.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	49	22	Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you away, and there be none to deliver you.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	4	Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	5	For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	6	To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	7	For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	8	For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	50	9	Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	4	At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	5	My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	6	Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	7	And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	8	Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	9	I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	10	Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	11	Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	12	And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	13	For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden my self from him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	14	But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	15	Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	16	Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them. Let death, etc.... This, and such like imprecations which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	17	But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	18	Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	19	He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me. Among many, etc.... That is, they that drew near to attack me were many in company all combined to fight against me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	20	God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	21	He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	22	They are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts. They are divided, etc.... Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing, by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and deceitful ways.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	23	Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	54	24	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord. Psalms Chapter 55 Miserere mei, Deus. A prayer of David in danger and distress.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	1	Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance form the sanctuary: for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when the Philistines held him in Geth.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	5	In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: I will not fear what flesh can do against me. My words.... The words or promises God has made in my favour.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	6	All the day long they detested my words: all their thoughts were against me unto evil.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	7	They will dwell and hide themselves: they will watch my heel. As they have waited for my soul,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	8	For nothing shalt thou save them: in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces. O God, For nothing shalt thou save them.... That is, since they lie in wait to ruin my soul, thou shalt for no consideration favour or assist them, but execute thy justice upon them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	9	I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set my tears in thy sight, As also in thy promise.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	55	10	Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	2	Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass away.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	3	I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	4	He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	5	And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	6	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	56	7	They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	2	If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	3	For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	4	The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: they have spoken false things.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	5	Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	6	Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	57	7	God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	58	3	Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	58	4	For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in upon me:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	58	5	Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	58	6	Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	59	9	Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength of my head. Juda is my king:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	59	10	Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe: to me the foreigners are made subject. The pot of my hope.... Or my watering pot. That is, a vessel for meaner uses, by being reduced to serve me, even in the meanest employments.—Ibid. Foreigners....

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	3	As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	4	And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	5	Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him: but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence, Who ascendeth upon the west.... Super occasum. St. Gregory understands it of Christ, who after his going down, like the sun, in the west, by his passion and death, ascended more glorious, and carried all before him. St. Jerome renders it, who ascendeth, or cometh up, through the deserts.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	6	Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his holy place:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	7	God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres. Of one manner.... That is, agreeing in faith, unanimous in love, and following the same manner of discipline. It is verified in the servants of God, living together in his house, which is the church. 1 Tim. 3.15.—Ibid. Them that were bound, etc.... The power and mercy of God appears in his bringing out of their captivity those that were strongly bound in their sins: and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been most provoking; and who by their evil habits were not only dead, but buried in their sepulchres.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	8	O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst pass through the desert:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	9	The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	10	Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect. A free rain.... the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in favour of God’s inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on to the promised land. It agrees particularly to the church of Christ his true inheritance, which is plentifully watered with the free rain of heavenly grace; and through many infirmities, that is, crosses and tribulations, is made perfect, and fitted for eternal glory.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	11	In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor. In it, etc.... That is, in this church, which is thy fold and thy inheritance, shall thy animals, thy sheep, dwell: where thou hast plentifully provided for them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	12	The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power. To them that preach good tidings.... Evangelizantibus. That is, to the preachers of the gospel; who receiving the word from the Lord, shall with great power and efficacy preach throughout the world the glad tidings of a Saviour, and of eternal salvation through him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	13	The king of powers is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils. The king of powers.... That is, the mighty King, the Lord of hosts, is of the beloved, of the beloved; that is, is on the side of Christ, his most beloved son: and his beautiful house, viz., the church, in which God dwells forever, shall by her spiritual conquests divide the spoils of many nations. The Hebrew (as it now stands pointed) is thus rendered, The kings of armies have fled, they have fled, and she that dwells at home (or the beauty of the house) shall divide the spoils.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	14	If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold. If you sleep among the midst of lots (intermedios cleros, etc.)... Viz., in such dangers and persecutions, as if your enemies were casting lots for your goods and persons: or in the midst of the lots, (intermedios terminos, as St. Jerome renders it,) that is, upon the very bounds or borders of the dominions of your enemies: you shall be secure nevertheless under the divine protection; and shall be enabled to fly away, like a dove, with glittering wings and feathers shining like the palest and most precious gold; that is, with great increase of virtue, and glowing with the fervour of charity.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	15	When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be whited with snow in Selmon. Kings over her.... That is, pastors and rulers over his church, viz., the apostles and their successors. Then by their ministry shall men be made whiter than the snow which lies on the top of the high mountain Selmon.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	16	The mountain of God is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat mountain. The mountain of God.... The church, which, Isa. 2.2, is called The mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains. It is here called a fat and a curdled mountain; that is to say, most fruitful, and enriched by the spiritual gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	17	Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end. Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?.... Why do you suppose or imagine there may be any other such curdled mountains? You are mistaken: the mountain thus favoured by God is but one; and this same he has chosen for his dwelling for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	18	The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place. The chariot of God.... Descending to give his law on mount Sina: as also of Jesus Christ his Son, ascending into heaven, to send from thence the Holy Ghost, to publish his new law, is attended with ten thousands, that is, with an innumerable multitude of joyful angels.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	19	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God. Led captivity captive.... Carrying away with thee to heaven those who before had been the captives of Satan; and receiving from God the Father gifts to be distributed to men; even to those who were before unbelievers.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	20	Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	21	Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death. The issues from death.... The Lord alone is master of the issues, by which we may escape from death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	22	But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	23	The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, I will turn them into the depth of the sea: I will turn them from Basan, etc.... I will cast out my enemies from their rich possessions, signified by Basan, a fruitful country; and I will drive them into the depth of the sea: and make such a slaughter of them, that the feet of my servants may be dyed in their blood, etc.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	24	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	25	They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my king who is in his sanctuary. Thy goings.... Thy ways, thy proceedings, by which thou didst formerly take possession of the promised land in favour of thy people; and shalt afterwards of the whole world, which thou shalt subdue to thy Son.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	26	Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels. Princes.... The apostles, the first converters of nations; attended by numbers of perfect souls, singing the divine praises, and virgins consecrated to God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	27	In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of Israel. From the fountains of Israel.... From whom both Christ and his apostles sprung. By Benjamin, the holy fathers on this place understand St. Paul, who was of that tribe, named here a youth, because he was the last called to the apostleship. By the princes of Juda, Zabulon, and Nephthali, we may understand the other apostles, who were of the tribe of Juda; or of the tribes of Zabulon, and Nephthali, where our Lord began to preach, Matt. 4.13, etc.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	28	There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	29	Command thy strength, O God confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us. Command thy strength.... Give orders that thy strength may be always with us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	30	From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	31	Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars: Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds.... or the wild beasts, which lie hid in the reeds. That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors, who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds, which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine, that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried by fire.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	32	Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God. Ambassadors shall come, etc.... It is a prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles, and by name of the Egyptians and Ethiopians.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	34	Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east. Behold he will give to his voice the voice of power: To the east.... From mount Olivet, which is on the east side of Jerusalem.—Ibid. The voice of power.... That is, he will make his voice to be a powerful voice: by calling from death to life, such as were dead in mortal sin: as at the last day he will by the power of his voice call all the dead from their graves.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	35	Give ye glory to God for Israel, his magnificence, and his power is in the clouds.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	67	36	God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God. Psalms Chapter 68 Salvum me fac, Deus. Christ in his passion declareth the greatness of his sufferings, and the malice of his persecutors the Jews; and foretelleth their reprobation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	1	Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David. For them that shall be changed.... A psalm for Christian converts, to remember the passion of Christ.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	2	Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul. The waters.... Of afflictions and sorrows. My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Matt. 26.38.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	3	I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	4	I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse, my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	5	They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away. I pay that which I took not away.... Christ in his passion made restitution of what he had not taken away, by suffering the punishment due to our sins, and so repairing the injury we had done to God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	6	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee: My foolishness and my offences.... which my enemies impute to me: or the follies and sins of men, which I have taken upon myself.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	7	Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	8	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	9	I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	10	For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	11	And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	12	And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	13	They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	18	And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	19	Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	20	Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	21	In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	22	And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	23	Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock. Let their table, etc....

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	24	Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	25	Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	26	Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	27	Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	28	Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	29	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	30	But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	31	I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	33	Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	34	For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	35	Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	68	36	For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance. Sion.... The catholic church.

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	69	3	Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	69	4	Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: ’Tis well, ’tis well. ’Tis well, ’tis well.... Euge, euge. St. Jerome renders it, vah, vah! which is the voice of one insulting and deriding. Some understand it as a detestation of deceitful flatterers.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	69	5	Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	70	1	A psalm for David. Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion: Of the sons of Jonadab.... The Rechabites, of whom see Jer. 35.

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	70	8	Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy greatness all the day long.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	70	9	Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	70	10	For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my soul have consulted together,	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	6	He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	7	In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, till the moon be taken away.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	8	And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	9	Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall lick the ground.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	10	The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	11	And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	12	For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that had no helper.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	13	He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	16	And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth. A firmament on the earth, etc.... This may be understood of the church of Christ, ever firm and visible: and of the flourishing condition of its congregation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	17	Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all nations shall magnify him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	18	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful things.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	19	And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	71	20	The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended. Are ended.... By this it appears that this psalm, though placed here, was in order of time the last of those which David composed. Psalms Chapter 72 Quam bonus Israel Deus. The temptation of the weak, upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked, is overcome by the consideration of the justice of God, who will quickly render to every one according to his works.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	1	A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	2	But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	3	Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	4	For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	5	They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	6	Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	7	Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart. Fatness.... Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them in their iniquity: and made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	8	They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	9	They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	10	Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them. Return here.... or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence which are set down in the following verses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	11	And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	12	Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they have obtained riches.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	13	And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	14	And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	15	If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children. If I said, etc.... That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	16	I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	17	Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	18	But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down. Thou hast put it to them.... In punishment of their deceits, or for deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end, which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	19	How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	20	As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	21	For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	22	And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	23	I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	24	Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	25	For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	26	For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	27	For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	72	28	But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion. Psalms Chapter 73 Ut quid, Deus. A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	1	Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	3	Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	4	And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs, Their ensigns, etc.... They have fixed their colours for signs and trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple: and they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place. This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the profanation of the temple by Antiochus.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	5	And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	6	They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	7	They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	8	They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	9	Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	10	How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	11	Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	12	But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	13	Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. The sea firm.... By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm walls, whilst Israel passed through: and destroying the Egyptians called here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king: casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	14	Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	15	Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers. Ethan rivers.... That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21.14.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	16	Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	17	Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	18	Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	19	Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	20	Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. The obscure of the earth.... Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled, that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	21	Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	22	Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	73	23	Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually. Psalms Chapter 74 Confitebimur tibi. There is a just judgment to come: therefore let the wicked take care.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	1	Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph. Corrupt not.... It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung. St. Augustine and other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to faint or fail in our hope: but to persevere with constancy in good: because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man according to his works.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	2	We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	3	When I shall take a time, I will judge justices. When I shall take a time.... In proper times: particularly at the last day, when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge: the same who originally laid the foundations of it, and as it were established its pillars.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	4	The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	5	I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	6	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	7	For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	8	For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	9	For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	10	But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	74	11	And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. Psalms Chapter 75 Notus in Judaea. God is known in his church: and exerts his power in protecting it. It alludes to the slaughter of the Assyrians, in the days of king Ezechias.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	1	Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	2	In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	3	And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	4	There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	5	Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	6	All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	7	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	8	Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath. From that time, etc.... From the time that thy wrath shall break out.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	9	Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	10	When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	11	For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	12	Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	75	13	Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth. Psalms Chapter 76 Voce mea. The faithful have recourse to God in trouble of mind, with confidence in his mercy and power.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	1	Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	2	I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	3	In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	4	I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	5	My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	6	I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	7	And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	8	Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	9	Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	10	Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	11	And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	12	I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	13	And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	14	Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	15	Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	16	With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	17	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	18	Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	19	The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	20	Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	76	21	Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalms Chapter 77 Attendite. God’s great benefits to the people of Israel, notwithstanding their ingratitude.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	1	Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	2	I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. Propositions.... Deep and mysterious sayings. By this it appears that the historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep and mysterious: as being figures of great truths appertaining to the time of the New Testament.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	3	How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	4	They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	5	And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	6	That another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	7	That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	8	That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	9	The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	10	They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	11	And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	12	Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	13	He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	14	And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	15	He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	16	He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	17	And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	18	And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	19	And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	20	Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	21	Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	22	Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	23	And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	25	Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	26	He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the south-west wind.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	27	And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	28	And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	29	So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	30	they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	31	And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	32	In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	33	And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	35	And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	36	And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	37	But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	38	But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	39	And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	40	How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	41	And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	42	They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	43	How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	44	And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	45	He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	46	And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	47	And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	48	And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	49	And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	50	He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	51	And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	52	And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	53	And he brought them out in hope and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	54	And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	55	And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	56	Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	57	And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	58	They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	59	God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	60	And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	61	And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	62	And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	63	Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	64	Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	65	And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	66	And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	68	But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	69	And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. As of unicorns.... That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn. This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm, foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting sanctuary of God, in his church.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	70	And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	71	To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	77	72	And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands. Psalms Chapter 78 Deus, venerunt gentes. The church in time of persecution prayeth for relief. It seems to belong to the time of the Machabees.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	1	A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	2	They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	3	They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	5	How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	6	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	7	Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	8	Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	9	Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name’s sake:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	10	Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	11	Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	12	And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	78	13	But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks to thee for ever. We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and generation. Psalms Chapter 79 Qui regis Israel. A prayer for the church in tribulation, commemorating God’s former favours.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	1	Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, a testimony for Asaph, a psalm.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	2	Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	3	Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses. Stir up thy might, and come to save us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	4	Convert us, O God: and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	5	O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	6	How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: and give us for our drink tears in measure?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	7	Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our enemies have scoffed at us.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	8	O God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	9	Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	10	Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	11	The shadow of it covered the hills: and the branches thereof the cedars of God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	12	It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto the river.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	13	Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	14	The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: and a singular wild beast hath devoured it.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	15	Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	16	And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	17	Things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. Things set on fire, etc.... So this vineyard of thine, almost consumed already, must perish, if thou continue thy rebukes.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	18	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself. The man of thy right hand.... Christ.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	19	And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: and we will call upon thy name.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	79	20	O Lord God of hosts, convert us and shew thy face, and we shall be saved. Psalms Chapter 80 Exultate Deo. An invitation to a solemn praising of God.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	1	Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself. For the winepresses, etc.... Torcularibus. It either signifies a musical instrument, or that this psalm was to be sung at the feast of the tabernacles after the gathering in of the vintage.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	2	Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	3	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery with the harp.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	4	Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your solemnity.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	5	For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of Jacob.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	6	He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	7	He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in baskets.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	80	8	Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction. In the secret place of tempest.... Heb., Of thunder. When thou soughtest to hide thyself from the tempest: or, when I came down to mount Sina, hidden from thy eyes in a storm of thunder.	10

But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries: inasmuch as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the footstool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, L. 3. De Spiritu Sancto, c. 12. And St. Augustine upon this psalm.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	98	6	Moses and Aaron among his priests: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them: Moses and Aaron among his priests....

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	101	8	I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	101	9	All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised me did swear against me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	101	10	For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	25	So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	26	There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	27	All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	28	What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	29	But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	30	Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	31	May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	32	He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	103	33	I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	1	Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name: declare his deeds among the Gentiles.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	2	Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous works.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	6	O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	7	He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	8	He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	9	Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	10	And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	11	Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	12	When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners therein:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	13	And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	14	He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their sakes.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	15	Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	16	And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	17	He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	18	They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	19	Until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	20	The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	21	He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	22	That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	23	And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	24	And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	25	He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants. He turned their heart, etc.... Not that God (who is never the author of sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of the benefits which God bestowed upon them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	26	He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	27	He gave them power to shew them signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	28	He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words. Grieved not his words.... That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his words: or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words: or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with darkness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	29	He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	30	Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	31	He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts. Sciniphs.... See the annotation, Ex.8.16.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	32	He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	33	And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	40	They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	41	He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	42	Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	43	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	44	And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	104	45	That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law. His justifications.... That is, his commandments; which here, and in many other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the keeping of them makes man just. The Protestants render it by the word statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works to justify. Psalms Chapter 105 Confitemini Domino. A confession of the manifold sins and ingratitudes of the Israelites. Alleluia.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	1	Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	2	Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises?	10

THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	6	We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	7	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	8	And he saved them for his own name’s sake: that he might make his power known.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	9	And he rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	10	And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	11	And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	12	And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	13	They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsel.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	14	And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without water.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	15	And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	16	And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiron.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	18	And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned the wicked.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	19	They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	20	And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	21	They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	22	Wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	23	And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	24	And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	25	And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	26	And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert;	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	27	And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	28	They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead. Initiated.... That is, they dedicated, or consecrated themselves to the idol of the Moabites and Madianites, called Beelphegor, or Baal-Peor. Num. 25.3.—Ibid. The dead.... Viz., idols without life.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	29	And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was multiplied among them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	30	Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	31	And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	32	They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	33	Because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips. He distinguished with his lips.... Moses, by occasion of the people’s rebellion and incredulity, was guilty of distinguishing with his lips; when, instead of speaking to the rock, as God had commanded, he said to the people, with a certain hesitation in his faith, Hear ye, rebellious and incredulous: Can we from this rock bring out water for you? Num. 20.10.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	34	They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	35	And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	36	And served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	37	And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	38	And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	39	And was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	40	And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	41	And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had dominion over them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	42	And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	43	Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	44	And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	45	And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	46	And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	47	Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among the nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	105	48	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it. Psalms Chapter 106 Confitemini Domino. All are invited to give thanks to God for his perpetual providence over men. Alleluia.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	1	Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	2	Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	3	From the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	4	They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	5	They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	6	And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered them out of their distresses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	7	And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	8	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	9	For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	10	Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	11	Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	12	And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened, and there was none to help them.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	13	Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	14	And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	15	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	16	Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	17	He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were brought low for their injustices.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	18	Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	19	And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	20	He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their destructions.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	21	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	22	And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his works with joy.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	23	They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	24	These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	25	He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	26	They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: their soul pined away with evils.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	27	They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	28	And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought them out of their distresses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	29	And he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	30	And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	31	Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	32	And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	33	He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of waters into dry ground:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	34	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	35	He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land into water springs.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	36	And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	37	And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded fruit of birth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	38	And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	39	Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	40	Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	41	And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	42	The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	106	43	Who is wise, and will keep these things; and will understand the mercies of the Lord? Psalms Chapter 107 Paratum cor meum. The prophet praiseth God for benefits received.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	1	A canticle of a psalm for David himself.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	2	My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and will give praise, with my glory.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	3	Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise in the morning early.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	4	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee among the nations.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	5	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto the clouds.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	6	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	7	That thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand and hear me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	8	God hath spoken in his holiness. I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	9	Galaad is mine: and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection of my head. Juda is my king:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	10	Moab the pot of my hope. Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe: the aliens are become my friends.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	11	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	12	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies?	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	13	O grant us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	107	14	Through God we shall do mightily: and he will bring our enemies to nothing. Psalms Chapter 108 Deus, laudem meam. David in the person of Christ, prayeth against his persecutors; more especially the traitor Judas: foretelling and approving his just punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	1	Unto the end, a psalm for David.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	2	O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	3	They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	4	Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	5	And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	6	Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand. Set thou the sinner over him, etc.... Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as curses.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	7	When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	8	May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	9	May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	10	Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	11	May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	12	May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	13	May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be blotted out.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	14	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	15	May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth:	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	16	because he remembered not to shew mercy,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	17	But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	18	And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	19	May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	20	This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	21	But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	23	I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	24	My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed for oil. For oil.... Propter oleum. The meaning is, my flesh is changed, being perfectly emaciated and dried up, as having lost all its oil or fatness.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	25	And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	26	Help me, O Lord my God; save me; according to thy mercy.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	27	And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	28	They will curse and thou wilt bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	29	Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	30	I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him.	10
THE BOOK OF PSALMS	108	31	Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors. Psalms Chapter 109 Dixit Dominus. Christ’s exaltation and everlasting priesthood.	10

The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	2	Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	3	Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	4	Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead: Predestinated, etc.... Christ as man, was predestinated to be the Son of God: and declared to be so (as the apostle here signifies) first, by power, that is, by his working stupendous miracles; secondly, by the spirit of sanctification, that is, by his infinite sanctity; thirdly, by his ressurection, or raising himself from the dead.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	6	Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	7	To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	8	First, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all: because your faith is spoken of in the whole world.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	10	Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	11	For I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	12	That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	13	And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you (and have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	14	To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	15	So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first and to the Greek.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	17	For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	19	Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. His eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	21	Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God or given thanks: but became vain in their thoughts. And their foolish heart was darkened.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	22	For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	23	And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts and of creeping things.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	24	Wherefore, God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness: to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	26	For this cause, God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature. God delivered them up.... Not by being author of their sins, but by withdrawing his grace, and so permitting them, in punishment of their pride, to fall into those shameful sins.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	27	And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts, one towards another: men with men, working that which is filthy and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	28	And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	29	Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness: full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity: whisperers,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	30	Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	31	Foolish, dissolute: without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	1	32	Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death: and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them. Romans Chapter 2 The Jews are censured, who make their boast of the law and keep it not. He declares who are the true Jews.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	1	Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	2	For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and patience and longsuffering? Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	5	But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his works.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	7	To them indeed who, according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	8	But to them that are contentious and who obey not the truth but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	9	Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil: of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	10	But glory and honour and peace to every one that worketh good: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	12	For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law: and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	13	For not the hearers of the law are just before God: but the doers of the law shall be justified.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	14	For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these, having not the law, are a law to themselves.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	15	Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them: and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	17	But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of God,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	18	And knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	19	Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	21	Thou therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou, that preachest that men should not steal, stealest.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	22	Thou, that sayest men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou, that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	23	Thou, that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	24	(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	25	Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	26	If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	27	And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	28	For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly: nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	2	29	But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God. Romans Chapter 3 The advantages of the Jews. All men are sinners and none can be justified by the works of the law, but only by the grace of Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	1	What advantage then hath the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	2	Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	3	For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	4	But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: That thou mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art judged. God only is essentially true. All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errors: nevertheless God, who is the truth, will make good his promise of keeping his church in all truth. See St. John 16.13.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	5	But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	6	(I speak according to man.) God forbid! Otherwise how shall God judge this world?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	8	And not rather (as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that there may come good? Whose damnation is just.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	9	What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	10	As it is written: There is not any man just. There is not any man just, viz.... by virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and grace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	11	There is none that understandeth: there is none that seeketh after God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	12	All have turned out of the way: they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	15	Their feet swift to shed blood:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	16	Destruction and misery in their ways:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	17	And the way of peace they have not known.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	20	Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	21	But now, without the law, the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	22	Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	23	For all have sinned and do need the glory of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	25	Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	26	Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time: that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	27	Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	28	For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law. By faith, etc.... The faith, to which the apostle here attributes man’s justification, is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified; but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised. Heb. 11. A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ. Gal. 5.6. In short, a faith which takes in hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments. And the works which he here excludes, are only the works of the law: that is, such as are done by the law of nature, or that of Moses, antecedent to the faith of Christ: but by no means, such as follow faith, and proceed from it.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	30	For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	3	31	Do we then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid! But we establish the law. Romans Chapter 4 Abraham was not justified by works done, as of himself, but by grace and by faith. And that before he was circumcised. Gentiles, by faith, are his children.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. By works.... Done by his own strength, without the grace of God, and faith in him. Not before God.... Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice. Reputed, etc.... By God, who reputeth nothing otherwise than it is. However, we may gather from this word, that when we are justified, our justification proceedeth from God’s free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature, abstracting from God’s grace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	4	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace but according to debt. To him that worketh.... Vis., as of his own fund, or by his own strength. Such a man, says the apostle, challenges his reward as a debt due to his own performances; whereas he who worketh not, that is, who presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength, but seeketh justice through faith and grace, is freely justified by God’s grace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	5	But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	6	As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God reputeth justice without works:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins are covered. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.... That is, blessed are those who, by doing penance, have obtained pardon and remission of their sins, and also are covered; that is, newly clothed with the habit of grace, and vested with the stole of charity.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.... That is, blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence, that no grievous sin can be imputed to him. And, likewise, blessed is the man, who after fall into sin, hath done penance and leads a virtuous life, by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent a relapse, that sin is no more imputed to him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	9	This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice. In the circumcision, etc.... That is, is it only for the Jews that are circumcised? No, says the apostle, but also for the uncircumcised Gentiles: who, by faith and grace, may come to justice; as Abraham did before he was circumcised.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	10	How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which he had, being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised: that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	12	And he might be the father of circumcision; not to them only that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world: but through the justice of faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	14	For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void: the promise is made of no effect. Be heirs.... That is, if they alone, who follow the ceremonies of the law, be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham; then that faith which was so much praised in him, will be found to be of little value. And the very promise will be made void, by which he was promised to be the father, not of the Jews only, but of all nations of believers.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	15	For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression. The law worketh wrath.... The law, abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God’s wrath.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	16	Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	17	(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations), before God, whom he believed: who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	19	And he was not weak in faith. Neither did he consider his own body, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the dead womb of Sara.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	20	In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust: but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	21	Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	22	And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	23	Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	24	But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	4	25	Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification. Romans Chapter 5 The grounds we have for hope in Christ. Sin and death came by Adam, grace and life by Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	1	Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	2	By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	3	And not only so: but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	4	And patience trial; and trial hope;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	5	And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	6	For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	7	For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	8	But God commendeth his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	9	Christ died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	11	And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	12	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned. By one man.... Adam, from whom we all contracted original sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	13	For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not. Not imputed.... That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	14	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	15	But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	16	And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	18	Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	19	For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	20	Now the law entered in that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound. That sin might abound.... Not as if the law were given on purpose for sin to abound: but that it so happened through man’s perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	5	21	That as sin hath reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans Chapter 6 The Christian must die to sin and live to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	1	What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	2	God forbid! For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	3	Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	4	For we are buried together with him by baptism into death: that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer. Old man—body of sin.... Our corrupt state, subject to sin and concupiscence, coming to us from Adam, is called our old man, as our state, reformed in and by Christ, is called the new man. And the vices and sins, which then ruled in us are named the body of sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	7	For he that is dead is justified from sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	8	Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	9	Knowing that Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no more. Death shall no more have dominion over him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	10	For in that he died to sin, he died once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	11	So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin: but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of justice unto God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	15	What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	16	Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death or of obedience unto justice.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	17	But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin but have obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have been delivered.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	18	Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	19	I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity: so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	20	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	21	What fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	22	But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	6	23	For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 7 We are released by Christ from the law and from the guilt of sin, though the inclination to it still tempts us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	1	Know you not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth? As long as it liveth; ... or, as long as he liveth.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	2	For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	3	Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	4	Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ: that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead that we may bring forth fruit to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	6	But now we are loosed from the law of death wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid! But I do not know sin, but by the law. For I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. Sin taking occasion.... Sin, or concupiscence, which is called sin, because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was weakened by the prohibition: the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly giving occasion to it: but occasion being taken by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	9	And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	10	And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me: and by it killed me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	12	Wherefore the law indeed is holy: and the commandment holy and just and good.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	13	Was that then which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me: that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure. That it may appear sin, or that sin may appear, viz.... To be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good, to work death.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual. But I am carnal, sold under sin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	15	For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will: but the evil which I hate, that I do. I do not that good which I will, etc.... The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason: and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors: and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind. But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	16	If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	18	For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will is present with me: but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	19	For the good which I will, I do not: but the evil which I will not, that I do.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	20	Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	21	I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	22	For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	23	But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	24	Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	7	25	The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God: but with the flesh, the law of sin. Romans Chapter 8 There is no condemnation to them that, being justified by Christ, walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. Their strong hope and love of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	1	There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	2	For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	4	That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	5	For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are of the flesh: but they that are according to the spirit mind the things that are of the spirit.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	6	For the wisdom of the flesh is death: but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	7	Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God. For it is not subject to the law of God: neither can it be.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	8	And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	9	But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin: but the spirit liveth, because of justification.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ, from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	14	For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	15	For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear: but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	16	For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God. The Spirit himself, etc.... By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God’s favour; by which they are much strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance: which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Phil. 2.12. And that he that thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall. 1 Cor. 10.12. See also, Rom. 11.20, 21, 22.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	17	And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	19	For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. The expectation of the creature, etc.... He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity: not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	21	Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	22	For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	23	And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit: even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	24	For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	26	Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For, we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, Asketh for us.... The Spirit is said to ask, and desire for the saints, and to pray in us; inasmuch as he inspireth prayer, and teacheth us to pray.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit desireth: because he asketh for the saints according to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	28	And we know that to them that love God all things work together unto good: to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son: that he might be the Firstborn amongst many brethren. He also predestinated, etc.... That is, God hath preordained that all his elect should be conformable to the image of his Son. We must not here offer to pry into the secrets of God’s eternal election; only firmly believe that all our good, in time and eternity, flows originally from God’s free goodness; and all our evil from man’s free will.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	30	And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	32	He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	33	Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God is he that justifieth:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	34	Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died: yea that is risen also again, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	35	Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or danger? Or persecution? Or the sword?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	36	(As it is written: For thy sake, we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	37	But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	38	For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might, I am sure.... That is, I am persuaded; as it is in the Greek, pepeismai.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 9 The apostle’s concern for the Jews. God’s election is free and not confined to their nation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	1	I speak the truth in Christ: I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	2	That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	3	For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren: who are my kinsmen according to the flesh: Anathema; ... A curse. The apostle’s concern and love for his countrymen the Jews was so great, that he was willing to suffer even an anathema, or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	4	Who are Israelites: to whom belongeth the adoption as of children and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	5	Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel. All are not Israelites, etc.... Not all, who are the carnal seed of Israel, are true Israelites in God’s account: who, as by his free grace, he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election and mercy, raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	7	Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children: but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	8	That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are the children of God: but they that are the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	9	For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come. And Sara shall have a son.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	10	And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	11	For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand): Not yet born, etc.... By this example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in his election, mercy and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined; nor to any prerogative of birth, or any forgoing merits. For as, antecedently to his grace, he sees no merits in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath: there is no one whom he might not justly leave in that mass; so that whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy: and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice. As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution of the other.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	12	Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	13	As it is written: Jacob I have loved: but Esau I have hated.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid!	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	15	For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Not of him that willeth, etc.... That is, by any power or strength of his own, abstracting from the grace of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	17	For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. To this purpose, etc.... Not that God made him on purpose that he should sin, and so be damned; but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin, and the abuse of his own free will, he raised him up to be a mighty king, to make a more remarkable example of him: and that his power might be better known, and his justice in punishing him, published throughout the earth.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	18	Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will. And whom he will, he hardeneth. He hardeneth.... Not by being the cause or author of his sin, but by withholding his grace, and so leaving him in his sin, in punishment of his past demerits.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	19	Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? For who resisteth his will?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	20	O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	21	Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour? The potter.... This similitude is used only to shew that we are not to dispute with our Maker, nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another; for since the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy, that he makes out of it so many vessels of honor; and it is no more than just, that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels of dishonor.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	23	That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared unto glory?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	24	Even us, whom also he hath called, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	25	As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy; one that hath obtained mercy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	26	And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them: you are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	27	And Isaias cried out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved. A remnant.... That is, a small number only of the children of Israel shall be converted and saved. How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions, when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel!	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	28	For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	29	And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabbaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who followed not after justice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	31	But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	32	Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	9	33	As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a rock of scandal. And whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded. Romans Chapter 10 The end of the law is faith in Christ, which the Jews refusing to submit to, cannot be justified.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	1	Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is for them unto salvation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	3	For they, not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God. The justice of God.... That is, the justice which God giveth us through Christ; as on the other hand, the Jews’ own justice is, that which they pretended to by their own strength, or by the observance of the law, without faith in Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	4	For the end of the law is Christ: unto justice to everyone that believeth.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	5	For Moses wrote that the justice which is of the law: The man that shall do it shall live by it.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	6	But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart: Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	7	Or who shall descend into the deep? That is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	8	But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee; even in thy mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	9	For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Thou shalt be saved.... To confess the Lord Jesus, and to call upon the name of the Lord (ver. 13) is not barely the professing a belief in the person of Christ; but moreover, implies a belief of his whole doctrine, and an obedience to his law; without which, the calling him Lord will save no man. St. Matt. 7.21.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	10	For, with the heart, we believe unto justice: but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	11	For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	12	For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things? Unless they be sent.... Here is an evident proof against all new teachers, who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any lawful mission, derived by succession from the apostles, to whom Christ said, John 20.21, As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	16	But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	17	Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	18	But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily: Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the whole world.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	19	But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation: by a foolish nation I will anger you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	20	But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me. I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	10	21	But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not and contradicteth me. Romans Chapter 11 God hath not cast off all Israel. The Gentiles must not be proud but stand in faith and fear.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	1	I say then: Hath God cast away his people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias, how he calleth on God against Israel?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	3	Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars. And I am left alone: and they seek my life.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	4	But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal. Seven thousand, etc.... This is very ill alleged by some, against the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ; the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of Jezabel in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Judah.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	5	Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	6	And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace. It is not now by works, etc.... If salvation were to come by works, done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such dead works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation. It is not the same with regard to works done with, and by, God’s grace; for to such works as these, he has promised eternal salvation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	7	What then? That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it. And the rest have been blinded.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	8	As it is written: God hath given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, until this present day. God hath given them, etc.... Not by his working or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their obstinacy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	9	And David saith: Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	11	I say then: Have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid! But by their offence salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them. That they should fall.... The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only, (many thousands of them having been at first converted,) and for a time; which fall of theirs, God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	12	Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the diminution of them the riches of the Gentiles: how much more the fulness of them?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	13	For I say to you, Gentiles: As long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	14	If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh and may save some of them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	15	For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root: but the root thee.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	19	Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	20	Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear. Thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.... We see here that he who standeth by faith may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	21	For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps also he spare not thee.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	22	See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.... The Gentiles are here admonished not to be proud, nor to glory against the Jews: but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they be cast off. Not that the whole church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, wert grafted into the good olive tree: how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	25	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery (lest you should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	26	And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	27	And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	28	As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. For the gifts and the calling of God are without.... his repenting himself of them; for the promises of God are unchangeable, nor can he repent of conferring his gifts.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	30	For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	31	So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	32	For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all. Concluded all in unbelief.... He hath found all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, in unbelief and sin; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own free will; so that their calling and election is purely owing to his mercy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	33	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	35	Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	11	36	For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen. Romans Chapter 12 Lessons of Christian virtues.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	2	And be not conformed to this world: but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	3	For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	4	For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ; and every one members one of another:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	6	And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	7	Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	8	He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	10	Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood: with honour preventing one another.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	11	In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	12	Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	13	Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	14	Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	15	Rejoice with them that rejoice: weep with them that weep.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	16	Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	17	To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things, not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of all men.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	18	If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	19	Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	20	But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	12	21	Be not overcome by evil: but overcome evil by good. Romans Chapter 13 Lessons of obedience to superiors and mutual charity.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	1	Let every soul be subject to higher powers. For there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	2	Therefore, he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	3	For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	4	For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	5	Wherefore be subject of necessity: not only for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	6	For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	7	Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	9	For: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	10	The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	11	And that, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	12	The night is passed And the day is at hand. Let us, therefore cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ: and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences. Romans Chapter 14 The strong must bear with the weak. Cautions against judging and giving scandal.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	1	Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. Eat all things.... Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine’s flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	4	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	5	For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day. Let every man abound in his own sense. Between day, etc.... Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the law.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	6	He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	9	For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	10	But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	11	For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	12	Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother’s way.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	14	I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	15	For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	16	Let not then our good be evil spoken of.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	18	For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved of men.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	19	Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	20	Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	21	It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	22	Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	14	23	But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin. Discerneth.... That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his conscience, what he deems unclean. Of faith.... By faith is here understood judgment and conscience: to act against which is always a sin. Romans Chapter 15 He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	1	Now, we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	2	Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	3	For Christ did not please himself: but, as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	4	For what things soever were written were written for our learning: that, through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	5	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind, one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	6	That with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	7	Wherefore, receive one another, as Christ also hath received you, unto the honour of God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	8	For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: Minister of the circumcision.... That is, executed his office and ministry towards the Jews, the people of the circumcision.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	9	But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles and will sing to thy name.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	10	And again he saith: rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	11	And again: praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles: and magnify him, all ye people.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	12	And again, Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing: that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Ghost.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	14	And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	15	But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given me from God,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	16	That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles: sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	17	I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	18	For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	19	By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about, as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	20	And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	21	But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	22	For which cause also, I was hindered very much from coming to you and have been kept away till now.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	23	But now, having no more place in these countries and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	24	When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that, as I pass, I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you: if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	25	But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	27	For it hath pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	28	When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	29	And I know that when I come to you I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	30	I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	31	That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	32	That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	15	33	Now the God of peace be with, you all. Amen. Romans Chapter 16 He concludes with salutations, bidding them beware of all that should oppose the doctrine they had learned.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	1	And I commend to you Phebe, our sister, who is in the ministry of the church, that is in Cenchrae:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	2	That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints and that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you. For she also hath assisted many, and myself also.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	3	Salute Prisca and Aquila, my helpers, in Christ Jesus	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	4	(Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not I only give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles),	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	5	And the church which is in their house. Salute Epenetus, my beloved: who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	6	Salute Mary, who hath laboured much among you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and fellow prisoners: who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	8	Salute Ampliatus, most beloved to me in the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	9	Salute Urbanus, our helper in Christ Jesus and Stachys, my beloved.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	10	Salute Apelles, approved in Christ.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	11	Salute them that are of Aristobulus’ household. Salute Herodian, my kinsman. Salute them that are of Narcissus’ household, who are in the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	12	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute Persis, the dearly beloved, who hath much laboured in the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	13	Salute Rufus, elect in the Lord, and his mother and mine.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes: and the brethren that are with them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	15	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympias: and all the saints that are with them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	17	Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them who make dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	18	For they that are such serve not Christ our Lord but their own belly: and by pleasing speeches and good words seduce the hearts of the innocent.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	19	For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice therefore in you. But I would have you to be wise in good and simple in evil.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	20	And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	21	Timothy, my fellow labourer, saluteth you: and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	22	I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	23	Caius, my host, and the whole church saluteth you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, saluteth you: and Quartus, a brother.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	25	Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret from eternity;	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	26	(Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith) known among all nations:	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE ROMANS	16	27	To God, the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	11
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	1	Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	2	Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	3	But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	4	To Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith, grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	5	For this cause I left thee in Crete: that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	6	If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot or unruly.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	7	For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	8	But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	9	Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	10	For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	11	Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	12	One of them a prophet of their own, said: The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	13	This testimony is true. Wherefore, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn themselves away from the truth.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	15	All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	1	16	They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him: being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate. Titus Chapter 2 How he is to instruct both old and young. The duty of servants. The Christian’s rule of life.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	1	But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	2	That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	3	The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	4	That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	5	To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands: that the word of God be not blasphemed.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	6	Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	7	In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	8	The sound word that can not be blamed: that he who is on the contrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	9	Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters: in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	10	Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	11	For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	12	Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world,	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	13	Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	2	15	These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. Titus Chapter 3 Other instructions and directions for life and doctrine.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	1	Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	2	To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	3	For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	4	But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	5	Not by the works of justice which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	6	Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	7	That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to hope of life everlasting.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	8	It is a faithful saying. And these things I will have thee affirm constantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	9	But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	10	A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	11	Knowing that he that is such an one is subverted and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment. By his own judgment.... Other offenders are judged, and cast out of the church, by the sentence of the pastors of the same church. Heretics, more unhappy, run out of the church of their own accord, and by doing so, give judgment and sentence against their own souls.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	12	When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	13	Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing be wanting to them.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	14	And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.	12
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TITUS	3	15	All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.	12
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	2	As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	3	A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight his paths.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	4	John was in the desert, baptizing and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	5	And there went out to him all the country of Judea and all they of Jerusalem and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	6	And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and he ate locusts and wild honey.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	7	And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	8	I have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	9	And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	10	And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending and remaining on him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	11	And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	12	And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	13	And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan. And he was with beasts: and the angels ministered to him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	14	And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	15	And saying: The time is accomplished and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	16	And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	17	And Jesus said to them: Come after me; and I will make you to become fishers of men.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	18	And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	19	And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	20	And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	21	And they entered into Capharnaum: and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	22	And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	24	Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	25	And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	26	And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	27	And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits: and they obey him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	28	And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	29	And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	30	And Simon’s wife’s mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	31	And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	32	And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	34	And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases. And he cast out many devils: and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	35	And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	37	And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	38	And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	39	And he was preaching in their synagogues and in all Galilee and casting out devils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him and kneeling down, said to him: If thou wilt thou canst make me clean.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	41	And Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	42	And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him: and he was made clean.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	43	And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	44	And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	1	45	But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places. And they flocked to him from all sides. Mark Chapter 2 Christ heals the sick of the palsy. He calls Matthew and excuses his disciples.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	1	And again he entered into Capharnaum after some days.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	2	And it was heard that he was in the house. And many came together, so that there was no room: no, not even at the door. And he spoke to them the word.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	3	And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	4	And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was: and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	5	And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	6	And there were some of the scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	7	Why doth this man speak thus? He blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God only?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	8	Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	9	Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed and walk?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	10	But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy):	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	11	I say to thee: Arise. Take up thy bed and go into thy house.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	12	And immediately he arose and, taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all: so that all wondered and glorified God, saying: We never saw the like.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	13	And he went forth again to the sea side: and all the multitude came to him. And he taught them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	14	And when he was passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	15	And it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they were many, who also followed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	16	And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	17	Jesus hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the just, but sinners.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	18	And the disciples of John and the Pharisees used to fast. And they come and say to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	19	And Jesus saith to them: Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	20	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: and then they shall fast in those days.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	21	No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	23	And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward and to pluck the ears of corn.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	24	And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	25	And he said to them: Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, himself and they that were with him?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	26	How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave to them who were with him?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	27	And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	2	28	Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also. Mark Chapter 3 Christ heals the withered hand. He chooses the twelve. He confutes the blasphemy of the Pharisees.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	1	And he entered again into the synagogue: and there was a man there who had a withered hand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	2	And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days, that they might accuse him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	3	And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	4	And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	5	And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	6	And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	7	But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	8	And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	9	And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	10	For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	11	And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	12	Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	13	And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	14	And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	15	And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	16	And to Simon he gave the name Peter:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	17	And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	18	And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus and Simon the Cananean:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	19	And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	20	And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	21	And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	22	And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	23	And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	25	And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	26	And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	27	No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	28	Amen I say to you that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	29	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	30	Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	31	And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	32	And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	33	And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	34	And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	3	35	For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother. Mark Chapter 4 The parable of the sower. Christ stills the tempest at sea.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	1	And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship and sat in the sea: and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	2	And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	3	Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	4	And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	5	And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	6	And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	8	And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	9	And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	10	And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	11	And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	12	That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. That seeing they may see, etc.... in punishment of their wilfully shutting their eyes, (St. Matt. 13. 15,) God justly withdrew those lights and graces, which otherwise he would have given them, for their effectual conversion.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	13	And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this, parable? and how shall you know all parables?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	14	He that soweth, soweth the word.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	16	And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	17	And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	18	And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	19	And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	20	And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	21	And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	22	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	23	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	24	And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	25	For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	26	And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	27	And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	28	For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	29	And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	30	And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	31	It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	32	And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	33	And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	34	And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	35	And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	36	And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth, it not concern thee that we perish?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	39	And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	4	40	And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him? Mark Chapter 5 Christ casts out a legion of devils: he heals the issue of blood, and raises the daughter of Jairus to life.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	1	And they came over the strait of the sea, into the country of the Gerasens.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	2	And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	3	Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him, not even with chains.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	4	For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	5	And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	6	And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	7	And crying with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus the Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	8	For he said unto him: Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	9	And he asked him: What is thy name? And he saith to him: My name is Legion, for we are many.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	10	And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of the country.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	11	And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	12	And the spirits besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	13	And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits going out, entered into the swine: and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, and were stifled in the sea.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	14	And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what was done:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	15	And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was troubled with the devil, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	16	And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been dealt with who had the devil; and concerning the swine.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	17	And they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	18	And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	19	And he admitted him not, but saith to him: Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had mercy on thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	20	And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men wondered.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	21	And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	22	And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus: and seeing him, falleth down at his feet.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	23	And he besought him much, saying: My daughter is at the point of death, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	24	And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	25	And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	26	And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	27	When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	28	For she said: If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	29	And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	30	And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said: Who hath touched my garments?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	31	And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	32	And he looked about to see her who had done this.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	34	And he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	35	While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying: Thy daughter is dead: why dost thou trouble the master any further?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	36	But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	37	And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	38	And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	39	And going in, he saith to them Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	40	And they laughed him to scorn. But he having put them all out, taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	41	And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her: Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted: Damsel (I say to thee) arise.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	42	And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked: and she was twelve years old: and they were astonished with a great astonishment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	5	43	And he charged them strictly that no man should know it: and commanded that something should be given her to eat. Mark Chapter 6 Christ teaches at Nazareth: he sends forth the twelve apostles: he feeds five thousand with five loaves; and walks upon the sea.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	1	And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his disciples followed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	2	And when the Sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying: How came this man by all these things? and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such mighty works as are wrought by his hands?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon? are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in regard of him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	4	And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	5	And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them. He could not.... Not for want of power, but because he would not work miracles in favour of obstinate and incredulous people, who were unworthy of such favours.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	6	And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the villages round about teaching.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	7	And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	8	And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only; no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	9	But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	10	And he said to them: Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	11	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	12	And going forth they preached that men should do penance:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	13	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	14	And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said: John the Baptist is risen again from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	15	And others said: It is Elias. But others said: It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	16	Which Herod hearing, said: John whom I beheaded, he is risen again from the dead.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	18	For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	19	Now Herodias laid snares for him: and was desirous to put him to death and could not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	20	For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man: and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things: and he heard him willingly. And kept him.... That is, from the designs of Herodias; and for fear of the people, would not put him to death, though she sought it; and through her daughter she effected her wish.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	21	And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	22	And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in, and had danced, and pleased Herod, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	23	And he swore to her: Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	24	Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? But she said: The head of John the Baptist.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	25	And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	26	And the king was struck sad. Yet because of his oath, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	27	But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	28	And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish: and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	29	Which his disciples hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	30	And the apostles coming together unto Jesus, related to him all things that they had done and taught.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	31	And he said to them: Come apart into a desert place, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	32	And going up into a ship, they went into a desert place apart.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	33	And they saw them going away, and many knew: and they ran flocking thither on foot from all the cities, and were there before them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	34	And Jesus going out saw a great multitude: and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	36	Send them away, that going into the next villages and towns, they may buy themselves meat to eat.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	37	And he answering said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	38	And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	39	And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	41	And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and the two fishes he divided among them all.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	42	And they all did eat, and had their fill.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	43	And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	44	And they that did eat, were five thousand men.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	45	And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship, that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida, whilst he dismissed the people.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	46	And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to pray,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	47	And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	48	And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	49	But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	50	For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	51	And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	52	For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	54	And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	55	And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	6	56	And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. Mark Chapter 7 Christ rebukes the Pharisees. He heals the daughter of the woman of Chanaan; and the man that was deaf and dumb.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	1	And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	2	And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	3	For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	4	And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	5	And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	6	But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	7	And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men. Doctrines and precepts of men.... See the annotations, Matt. 15. 9, 11.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	8	For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	9	And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	10	For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother. And He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	11	But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban (which is a gift) whatsoever is from me shall profit thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	12	And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	13	Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	14	And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all and understand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	15	There is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	16	If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	17	And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	18	And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? Understand you not that every thing from without entering into a man cannot defile him:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	19	Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	20	But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	22	Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	23	All these evil things come from within and defile a man.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	24	And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it. And he could not be hid.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	25	For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	26	For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	27	Who said to her: suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	28	But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	29	And he said to her: For this saying, go thy way. The devil is gone out of thy daughter.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	30	And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed and that the devil was gone out.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	31	And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	32	And they bring to him one deaf and dumb: and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	33	And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears: and spitting, he touched his tongue.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	34	And looking up to heaven, he groaned and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	35	And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	36	And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	7	37	And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well. He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak. Mark Chapter 8 Christ feeds four thousand. He gives sight to a blind man. He foretells his passion.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	1	In those days again, when there was a great multitude and they had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	3	And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way: for some of them came from afar off.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	4	And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	5	And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke and gave to his disciples for to set before them. And they set them before the people.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	7	And they had a few little fishes: and he blessed them and commanded them to be set before them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	8	And they did eat and were filled: and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand. And he sent them away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	10	And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	12	And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	13	And leaving them, he went up again into the ship and passed to the other side of the water.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	14	And they forgot to take bread: and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	15	And he charged them saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	16	And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	17	Which Jesus knowing, saith to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? Do you not yet know nor understand? Have you still your heart blinded?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	18	Having eyes, see you not? And having ears, hear you not? Neither do you remember?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	19	When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him: Twelve.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	20	When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of fragments took you up? And they say to him: Seven.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	21	And he said to them: How do you not yet understand?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	22	And they came to Bethsaida: and they bring to him a blind man. And they besought him that he would touch him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	23	And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town. And spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	24	And looking up, he said: I see men, as it were trees, walking.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	25	After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes: and he began to see and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	26	And he sent him into his house, saying: Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	27	And Jesus went out, and his disciples into the towns of Cæsarea Philippi. And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Whom do men say that I am?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	28	Who answered him, saying: John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others as one of the prophets.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	29	Then he saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Peter answering said to him: Thou art the Christ.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	30	And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	31	And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests and the scribes: and be killed and after three days rise again.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	32	And he spoke the word openly. And Peter taking him began to rebuke him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	33	Who turning about and seeing his disciples, threatened Peter, saying: Go behind me, Satan, because thou savourest not the things that are of God but that are of men.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	34	And calling the multitude together with his disciples, he said to them: If any man will follow me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	36	For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	38	For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation: the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	8	39	And he said to them: Amen I say to you that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God coming in power. Mark Chapter 9 Christ is transfigured. He casts out the dumb spirit. He teaches humility and to avoid scandal.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	1	And after six days, Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	2	And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	3	And there appeared to them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	4	And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	5	For he knew not what he said: for they were struck with fear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	6	And there was a cloud overshadowing them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved Son. Hear ye him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	7	And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only with them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	8	And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	9	And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	10	And they asked him, saying: Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elias must come first?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	11	Who answering, said to them: Elias, when he shall come first, shall restore all things; and as it is written of the Son of man that he must suffer many things and be despised.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	12	But I say to you that Elias also is come (and they have done to him whatsoever they would), as it is written of him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	13	And coming to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes disputing with them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	14	And presently all the people, seeing Jesus, were astonished and struck with fear: and running to him, they saluted him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	15	And he asked them: What do you question about among you?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	16	And one of the multitude, answering, said: Master, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	17	Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him: and he foameth and gnasheth with the teeth and pineth away. And I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out: and they could not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	18	Who answering them, said: O incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	19	And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	20	And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he said: From his infancy.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	21	And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	22	And Jesus saith to him: If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	23	And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	24	And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him and enter not any more into him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	25	And crying out and greatly tearing him, he went our of him. And he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	26	But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up. And he arose.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	27	And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	28	And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	29	And departing from thence, they passed through Galilee: and he would not that any man should know it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	30	And he taught his disciples and said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise again the third day.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	31	But they understood not the word: and they were afraid to ask him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	32	And they came to Capharnaum. And when they were in the house, he asked them: What did you treat of in the way?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	33	But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	34	And sitting down, he called the twelve and saith to them: If any man desire to be first, he shall be the last of all and be minister of all.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	35	And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them. Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	36	Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name receiveth me. And whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	37	John answered him, saying: Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us: and we forbade him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	38	But Jesus said: Do not forbid him. For there is no man that doth a miracle in my name and can soon speak ill of me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	39	For he that is not against you is for you.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	40	For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because you belong to Christ: amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	41	And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me: it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	42	And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into unquenchable fire:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	43	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	44	And if thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting than having two feet to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	45	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	46	And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	47	Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	48	For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with salt.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	9	49	Salt is good. But if the salt become unsavoury, wherewith will you season it? Have salt in you: and have peace among you. Mark Chapter 10 Marriage is not to be dissolved. The danger of riches. The ambition of the sons of Zebedee. A blind man is restored to his sight.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	1	And rising up from thence, he cometh into the coasts of Judea beyond the Jordan: and the multitude flocked to him again. And as he was accustomed, he taught them again.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	2	And the Pharisees coming to him asked him, tempting him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	3	But he answering, saith to them: What did Moses command you?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	4	Who said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce and to put her away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	5	To whom Jesus answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart, he wrote you that precept.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	7	For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	8	And they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	9	What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	10	And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the same thing.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	11	And he saith to them: Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	12	And if the wife shall put away her husband and be married to another, she committeth adultery.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	13	And they brought to him young children, that he might touch them. And the disciples rebuked them that brought them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	14	Whom when Jesus saw, he was much displeased and saith to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	15	Amen I say to you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not enter into it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	16	And embracing them and laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	17	And when he was gone forth into the way, a certain man, running up and kneeling before him, asked him: Good Master, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	18	And Jesus said to him: Why callest thou me good? None is good but one, that is God. None is good.... Of himself entirely and essentially, but God alone; men may be good also, but only by participation of God’s goodness.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	20	But he answering, said to him: Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	21	And Jesus, looking on him, loved him and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee. Go, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	22	Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	23	And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	25	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	26	Who wondered the more, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	27	And Jesus looking on them, saith with men it is impossible; but not with God. For all things are possible with God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	28	And Peter began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	29	Jesus answering said: Amen I say to you, there is no man who hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	30	Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come life everlasting.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	31	But many that are first shall be last: and the last, first.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus went before them. And they were astonished and following were afraid. And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	33	Saying: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes and ancients. And they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	34	And they shall mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	35	And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: Master, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	36	But he said to them: What would you that I should do for you?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	37	And they said: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	38	And Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	39	But they said to him: We can. And Jesus saith to them: You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of; and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized you shall be baptized.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	40	But to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	41	And the ten, hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and John.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	42	But Jesus calling them, saith to them: You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them: and their princes have power over them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	43	But it is not so among you: but whosoever will be greater shall be your minister.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	44	And whosoever will be first among you shall be the servant of all.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	45	For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto: but to minister and to give his life a redemption for many.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	46	And they came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind man, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	47	Who when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, began to cry out and to say: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	48	And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	49	And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort. Arise, he calleth thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	50	Who casting off his garment leaped up and came to him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	51	And Jesus answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni. That I may see.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	10	52	And Jesus saith to him: Go thy way. Thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he saw and followed him in the way. Mark Chapter 11 Christ enters into Jerusalem upon an ass. He curses the barren fig tree and drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	1	And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	2	And saith to them: Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat. Loose him and bring him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	3	And if any man shall say to you: What are you doing? Say ye that the Lord hath need of him. And immediately he will let him come hither.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	4	And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in the meeting of two ways. And they loose him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	5	And some of them that stood there said to them: What do you loosing the colt?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	6	Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them. And they let him go with them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus. And they lay their garments on him: and he sat upon him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	9	And they that went before and they that followed cried, saying: Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh: Hosanna in the highest.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	11	And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple: and having viewed all things round about, when now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethania with the twelve.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	12	And the next day when they came out from Bethania, he was hungry.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	13	And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	14	And answering he said to it: May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee any more for ever! And his disciples heard it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	15	And they came to Jerusalem. And when he was entered into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple: and over threw the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of them that sold doves.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	16	And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	17	And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written: My house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations, but you have made it a den of thieves.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	18	Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	19	And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	20	And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	21	And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree which thou didst curse is withered away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	22	And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	23	Amen I say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	24	Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive: and they shall come unto you.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	25	And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any man: that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	26	But if you will not forgive, neither will your father that is in heaven forgive you your sins.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem. And when he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	28	And they say to him: By what authority dost thou these things? And who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	29	And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word. And answer you me: and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	30	The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? Answer me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	31	But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	32	If we say, From men, we fear the people. For all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	11	33	And they answering, say to Jesus: We know not. And Jesus answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. Mark Chapter 12 The parable of the vineyard and husbandmen. Caesar’s right to tribute. The Sadducees are confuted. The first commandment. The widow’s mite.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	1	And he began to speak to them in parables: A certain man planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it to husbandmen: and went into a far country.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	3	Who, having laid hands on him, beat and sent him away empty.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	4	And again he sent to them another servant: and him they wounded in the head and used him reproachfully.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	5	And again he sent another, and him they killed: and many others, of whom some they beat, and others they killed.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	6	Therefore, having yet one son, most dear to him, he also sent him unto them last of all, saying: They will reverence my son.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	7	But the husbandmen said one to another: This is the heir. Come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	8	And laying hold on him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	9	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	10	And have you not read this scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	11	By the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	12	And they sought to lay hands on him: but they feared the people. For they knew that he spoke this parable to them. And leaving him, they went their way.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	13	And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians: that they should catch him in his words.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	14	Who coming, say to him: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar? Or shall we not give it?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	15	Who knowing their wiliness, saith to them: Why tempt you me? Bring me a penny that I may see it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	16	And they brought it him. And he saith to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They say to him, Caesar’s.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	17	And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	18	And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	19	Master, Moses wrote unto us that if any man’s brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	20	Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died leaving no issue.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	21	And the second took her and died: and neither did he leave any issue. And the third in like manner.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	22	And the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave issue. Last of all the woman also died.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	24	And Jesus answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures nor the power of God?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	25	For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	26	And as concerning the dead that they rise again have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	27	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You therefore do greatly err.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	28	And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	29	And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul and with thy whole mind and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	31	And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	32	And the scribe said to him: Well, Master, thou hast said in truth that there is one God and there is no other besides him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	33	And that he should be loved with the whole heart and with the whole understanding and with the whole soul and with the whole strength. And to love one’s neighbour as one’s self is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	34	And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	35	And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple: How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	36	For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord. And whence is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	38	And he said to them in his doctrine: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	39	And to sit in the first chairs in the synagogues and to have the highest places at suppers:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	40	Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer. These shall receive greater judgment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	41	And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. And many that were rich cast in much.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow: and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	43	And calling his disciples together, he saith to them: Amen I say to you, this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	12	44	For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living. Mark Chapter 13 Christ foretells the destruction of the temple and the signs that shall forerun the day of judgment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	1	And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: Master, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	2	And Jesus answering, said to him: Seest thou all these great buildings? There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	4	Tell us, when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	5	And Jesus answering, began to say to them: Take heed lest any man deceive you.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	6	For many shall come in my name saying, I am he: and they shall deceive many.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	7	And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be: but the end is not yet.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines. These things are the beginning of sorrows.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	9	But look to yourselves. For they shall deliver you up to councils: and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	10	And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	11	And when they shall lead you and deliver you up, be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye. For it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	12	And the brother shall betray his brother unto death, and the father his son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall work their death.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	13	And you shall be hated by all men for my name’s sake. But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	14	And when you shall see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not (he that readeth let him understand): then let them that are in Judea flee unto the mountains.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	16	And let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up his garment.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	17	And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	18	But pray ye that these things happen not in winter.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	19	For in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now: neither shall be.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	20	And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but, for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	21	And then if any man shall say to you: Lo, here is Christ. Lo, he is here: do not believe.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	22	For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets: and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	23	Take you heed therefore: behold, I have foretold you all things.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	24	But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	25	And the stars of heaven shall be falling down and the powers that are in heaven shall be moved.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	27	And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	28	Now of the fig tree learn ye a parable. When the branch thereof is now tender and the leaves are come forth, you know that summer is very near.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	29	So you also when you shall see these things come to pass, know ye that it is very nigh, even at the doors.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	30	Amen, I say to you that this generation shall not pass until all these things be done.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	32	But of that day or hour no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father. Nor the Son.... Not that the Son of God is absolutely ignorant of the day of judgment, but that he knoweth it not, as our teacher; that is, he knoweth it not so as to teach it to us, as not being expedient.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	33	Take ye heed, watch and pray. For ye know not when the time is.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	34	Even as a man who, going into a far country, left his house and gave authority to his servants over every work and commanded the porter to watch.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	35	Watch ye therefore (for you know not when the lord of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning):	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	36	Lest coming on a sudden, he find you sleeping.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	13	37	And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch. Mark Chapter 14 The first part of the history of the passion of Christ.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	1	Now the feast of the pasch and of the Azymes was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him and kill him. Azymes.... That is, the feast of the unleavened bread.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	2	But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	3	And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard. And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	4	Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	5	For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	6	But Jesus said: Let her alone. Why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	7	For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	8	She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	9	Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	10	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	11	Who hearing it were glad: and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	12	Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	13	And he sendeth two of his disciples and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	14	And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	15	And he will shew you a large dining room furnished. And there prepare ye for us.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	16	And his disciples went their way and came into the city. And they found as he had told them: and they prepared the pasch.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	17	And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	18	And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	19	But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one by one: Is it I?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	20	Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	21	And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	22	And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke and gave to them and said: Take ye. This is my body.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	23	And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	24	And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	25	Amen I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	26	And when they had sung an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	27	And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	28	But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	29	But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	30	And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to-day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. Crow twice.... The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing our Saviour spoke of; and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the first crowing.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	31	But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	32	And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	33	And he taketh Peter and James and John with him: and he began to fear and to be heavy.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	34	And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	35	And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground: and he prayed that, if it might be, the hour might pass from him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	36	And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	37	And he cometh and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	38	Watch ye: and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	39	And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	40	And when he returned, he found them again asleep (for their eyes were heavy): and they knew not what to answer him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	41	And he cometh the third time and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	42	Rise up: let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	43	And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	44	And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he. Lay hold on him: and lead him away carefully.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	45	And when he was come, immediately going up to him he saith: Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	46	But they laid hands on him and held him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	47	And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest and cut off his ear.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	48	And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching: and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	50	Then his disciples, leaving him, all fled away.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	51	And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	52	But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	53	And they brought Jesus to the high priest. And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death: and found none.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	56	For many bore false witness against him: and their evidences were not agreeing.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	57	And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	59	And their witness did not agree.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	60	And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	61	But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	62	And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	63	Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	65	And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	66	Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	67	And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	68	But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	69	And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	70	But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	14	72	And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep. Mark Chapter 15 The continuation of the history of the passion.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	1	And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away and delivered him to Pilate.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	2	And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	3	And the chief priests accused him in many things.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	4	And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	5	But Jesus still answered nothing: so that Pilate wondered.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	6	Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	7	And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	8	And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do as he had ever done unto them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	9	And Pilate answered them and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	12	And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	13	But they again cried out: Crucify him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	14	And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	15	And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas: and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace: and they called together the whole band.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	17	And they clothed him with purple: and, platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	18	And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	19	And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	20	And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him: and they led him out to crucify him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	21	And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	22	And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh. But he took it not.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	24	And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	25	And it was the third hour: and they crucified him. The third hour.... The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were named from the hour from which they began; the first, third, sixth, and ninth hour. Our Lord was crucified a little before noon; before the third hour had quite expired; but when the sixth hour was near at hand.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	26	And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	27	And with him they crucify two thieves: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	29	And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days buildest it up again:	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	30	Save thyself, coming down from the cross.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	31	In like manner also the chief priests, mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	32	Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	34	And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	35	And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	36	And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	37	And Jesus, having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	39	And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	40	And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and Salome,	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	41	Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	42	And when evening was now come (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath),	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	44	But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	45	And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	46	And Joseph, buying fine linen and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	15	47	And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. Mark Chapter 16 Christ’s resurrection and ascension.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	1	And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	2	And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen. The sun being now risen.... They set out before it was light, to go to the sepulchre; but the sun was risen when they arrived there. Or, figuratively, the sun here spoken of is the sun of justice, Christ Jesus our Lord, who was risen before their coming.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	3	And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	4	And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	6	Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee. There you shall see him, as he told you.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	8	But they going out, fled from the sepulchre: for a trembling and fear had seized them. And they said nothing to any man: for they were afraid.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	9	But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen; out of whom he had cast seven devils.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	10	She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	11	And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	12	And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	13	And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	14	At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	15	And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	17	And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	18	They shall take up serpents: and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay their hand upon the sick: and they shall recover.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	19	And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God.	13
THE HOLY GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ACCORDING TO ST. MARK	16	20	But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.	13
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus who are at Colossa.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	3	Grace be to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	4	Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have towards all the saints.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	5	For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard in the word of the truth of the gospel,	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	6	Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole world and bringeth forth fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	7	As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus;	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	8	Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	9	Therefore we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	10	That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleasing; being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	11	Strengthened with all might according to the power of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy,	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	12	Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love,	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: The firstborn.... That is, first begotten; as the Evangelist declares, the only begotten of his Father: hence, St. Chrisostom explains firstborn, not first created, as he was not created at all, but born of his Father before all ages; that is, coeval with the Father and with the Holy Ghost.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	16	For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers. All things were created by him and in him.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	17	And he is before all: and by him all things consist.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he may hold the primacy:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	19	Because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	20	And through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth and the things that are in heaven.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	21	And you, whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind in evil works:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	22	Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unspotted and blameless before him:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	23	If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is preached in all the creation that is under heaven: whereof I Paul am made a minister.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church: Wanting.... There is no want in the sufferings of Christ in himself as head: but many sufferings are still wanting, or are still to come, in his body the church, and his members the faithful.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	25	Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given me towards you, that I may fulfil the word of God:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	26	The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations, but now is manifested to his saints,	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	27	To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	28	Whom we preach, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	1	29	Wherein also I labour, striving according to his working which he worketh in me in power. Colossians Chapter 2 He warns them against the impostures of the philosophers and the Jewish teachers, that would withdraw them from Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	1	For I would have you know what manner of care I have for you and for them that are at Laodicea and whosoever have not seen my face in the flesh:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	2	That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed in charity and unto all riches of fulness of understanding, unto the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	4	Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	5	For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am with you, rejoicing, and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	6	As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	7	Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned: abounding in him in thanksgiving.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	8	Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit: according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	10	And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	11	In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh: but in the circumcision of Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	12	Buried with him in baptism: in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	13	And you, when you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	14	Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	15	And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths, In meat, etc.... He means with regard to the Jewish observations of the distinction of clean and unclean meats; and of their festivals, new moons, and sabbaths, as being no longer obligatory.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	18	Let no man seduce you, willing in humility and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh: Willing, etc.... That is, by a self willed, self invented, superstitious worship, falsely pretending humility, but really proceeding from pride. Such was the worship, that many of the philosophers (against whom St. Paul speaks, ver. 8) paid to angels or demons, by sacrificing to them, as carriers of intelligence betwixt God and men; pretending humility in so doing, as if God was too great to be addressed by men; and setting aside the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, who is the head both of angels and men. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics, disciples of Simon and Menander, to the angels, whom they believed to be makers and lords of this lower world. This is certain, that they whom the apostle here condemns, did not hold the head, (ver. 19,) that is, Jesus Christ, and his mediatorship; and therefore what he writes here no way touches the Catholic doctrine and practice, of desiring our good angels to pray to God for us, through Jesus Christ. St. Jerome [Epist. ad Algas.] understands by the religion or service of angels, the Jewish teachers, who sought to subject the new Christians to the observance of the Mosaic law.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	19	And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth into the increase of God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	20	If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	21	Touch not: taste not: handle not. Touch not, etc.... The meaning is, that Christians should not subject themselves, either to the ordinances of the old law, forbidding touching or tasting things unclean; or to the superstitious invention of heretics, imposing such restraints, under pretence of wisdom, humility, or mortification.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	22	Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh. Colossians Chapter 3 He exhorts them to put off the old man, and to put on the new. The duties of wives and husbands, children and servants.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	1	Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	2	Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	3	For you are dead: and your life is hid with Christ in God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	4	When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness, which is the service of idols.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	6	For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	7	In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	8	But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	9	Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	10	And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	11	Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	12	Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	13	Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	14	But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	15	And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly: in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	17	All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	19	Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter towards them.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	20	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	21	Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh: not serving to the eye, as pleasing men: but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	23	Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	24	Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	3	25	For he that doth wrong shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully. And there is no respect of persons with God. Colossians Chapter 4 He recommends constant prayer and wisdom. Various salutations.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	1	Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal: knowing that you also have a master in heaven.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	2	Be instant in prayer: watching in it with thanksgiving.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	3	Praying withal for us also, that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound):	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	4	That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	5	Walk with wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	6	Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt: that you may know how you ought to answer every man.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	7	All the things that concern me, Tychicus, our dearest brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	8	Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that he may know the things that concern you and comfort your hearts:	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	9	With Onesimus, a most beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. All things that are done here, they shall make known to you.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you: and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabas, touching whom you have received commandments. If he come unto you, receive him.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	11	And Jesus that is called Justus: who are of the circumcision. These only are my helpers, in the kingdom of God: who have been a comfort to me.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	12	Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, who is always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	13	For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you and for them that are at Laodicea and them at Hierapolis.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	14	Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you: and Demas.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	15	Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea: and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	16	And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans. And that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.... What this epistle was is uncertain, and annotators have given different opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an epistle which St. Paul wrote to the Laodiceans, and is since lost, for that now extant is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of St. Paul; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that epistle. Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St. Paul by the Laodiceans, which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them. However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable that St. Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans, about the same time that he wrote to the Colossians, as he had them both equally at heart, and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the Colossians for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate to each other what they had received from him; as one epistle might contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers, against which the apostle was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their pernicious doctrine.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	17	And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.	14
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE COLOSSIANS	4	18	The salutation of Paul with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. Grace be with you. Amen.	14
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	2	To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place of theirs and ours.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	3	Grace to you and peace, from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	4	I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	5	That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance and in all knowledge;	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	6	As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	7	So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	8	Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	9	God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you: but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	11	For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	13	Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	14	I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	15	Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	18	For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	19	For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	20	Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	21	For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	22	For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	24	But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men. The foolishness, etc.... That is to say, what appears foolish to the world in the ways of God, is indeed most wise; and what appears weak is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	26	For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	27	But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	28	And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his sight.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	30	But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	31	That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 2 His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	2	For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	3	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	5	That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	9	But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	10	But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	12	Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	13	Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	14	But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined. The sensual man—the spiritual man.... The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	15	But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. 1 Corinthians Chapter 3 They must not contend about their teachers, who are but God’s ministers and accountable to him. Their works shall be tried by fire.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	2	I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	3	For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	4	For while one saith: I indeed am of Paul: and another: I am of Apollo: are you not men? What then is Apollo and what is Paul?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	5	The ministers of him whom you have believed: and to every one as the Lord hath given.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	6	I have planted, Apollo watered: but God gave the increase.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	7	Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	9	For we are God’s coadjutors. You are God’s husbandry: you are God’s building.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	10	According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	11	For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	12	Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble: Upon this foundation.... The foundation is Christ and his doctrine: or the true faith in him, working through charity. The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser sins. Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial, (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest of what sort every man’s work has been: of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of God’s judgment shall try every man’s work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	13	Every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	14	If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	15	If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	16	Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	17	But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	20	And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	21	Let no man therefore glory in men.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	22	For all things are yours, whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	23	And you are Christ’s. And Christ is God’s. 1 Corinthians Chapter 4 God’s ministers are not to be judged. He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	1	Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	2	Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	3	But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man’s day. But neither do I judge my own self.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	4	For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	5	Therefore, judge not before the time: until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise from God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	6	But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	7	For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	8	You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honourable, but we without honour.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	11	Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	12	And we labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled: and we bless. We are persecuted: and we suffer it.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	13	We are blasphemed: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	14	I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest children.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	15	For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	16	Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	17	For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus: as I teach every where in every church.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	18	As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	21	What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit of meekness? 1 Corinthians Chapter 5 He excommunicates the incestuous adulterer and admonishes them to purge out the old leaven.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	1	It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father’s wife.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	2	And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	3	I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	5	To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	7	Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	8	Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	9	I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	10	I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this world.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	11	But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	13	For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves. 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 He blames them for going to law before unbelievers. Of sins that exclude from the kingdom of heaven. The evil of fornication.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	2	Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	3	Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	4	If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother: and that before unbelievers.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	7	Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? A fault.... Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	8	But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	9	Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	10	Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	11	And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	12	All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any. All things are lawful, etc.... That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	13	Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	14	Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	15	Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	16	Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	18	Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	19	Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God: and you are not your own?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	20	For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. 1 Corinthians Chapter 7 Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy. Virginity is preferable to a married state.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	2	But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband. Have his own wife.... That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are. (Ver. 7:8.) But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	3	Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	5	Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	6	But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment. By indulgence.... That is, by a condescension to your weakness.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	7	For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	9	But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt. If they do not contain, etc.... This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by vow, have given their first faith to God; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, if they cannot contain.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	10	But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	11	And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	12	For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away. I speak, not the Lord.... Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	13	And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy. Is sanctified.... The meaning is not, that the faith of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation; but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	15	But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	16	For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	17	But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	18	Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	21	Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	23	You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	25	Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	26	I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	27	Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	28	But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	29	This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	31	And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	32	But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	33	But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	34	And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	35	And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	36	But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry. Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc.... The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will and not sin, provided they afterwards marry; but that the father, with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no sin to him if she marry.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	37	For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	38	Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	39	A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	40	But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God. 1 Corinthians Chapter 8 Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	1	Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth. Knowledge puffeth up, etc.... Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known by him.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	4	But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	5	For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many): Gods many, etc.... Reputed for such among the heathens.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	6	Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	7	But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	8	But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	9	But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	10	For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	12	Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	13	Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother. If meat scandalize.... That is, if my eating cause my brother to sin. 1 Corinthians Chapter 9 The apostle did not make use of his power of being maintained at the charges of those to whom he preached, that he might give no hindrance to the gospel. Of running in the race and striving for the mastery.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	1	Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	2	And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	3	My defence with them that do examine me is this.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	4	Have not we power to eat and to drink?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	5	Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister as well as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? A woman, a sister.... Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	7	Who serveth as a soldier, at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	8	Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say; these things?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	10	Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	13	Know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar partake with the altar?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	14	So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	15	But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die rather than that any man should make my glory void.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	16	For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me: for a necessity lieth upon me. For woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel. It is no glory.... That is, I have nothing to glory of.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	18	What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	19	For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	20	And I became to the Jews a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	21	To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	22	To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	23	And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be made partaker thereof.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	24	Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	25	And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things. And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible one.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	26	I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	27	But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway. I chastise, etc.... Here St. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires. 1 Corinthians Chapter 10 By the example of the Israelites, he shews that we are not to build too much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the service of idols and from things offered to idols.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	1	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud: and all passed through the sea.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	2	And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea: In Moses.... Under the conduct of Moses, they received baptism in figure, by passing under the cloud, and through the sea; and they partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure, by eating of the manna, (called here a spiritual food because it was a figure of the true bread which comes down from heaven,) and drinking the water, miraculously brought out of the rock, called here a spiritual rock, because it was also a figure of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual food:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	4	And all drank the same spiritual drink: (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.)	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	5	But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	6	Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things, as they also coveted.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	7	Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication: and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	10	Neither do you murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	11	Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. The ends of the world.... That is, the last ages.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	12	Wherefore, he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	13	Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. Or.... no temptation hath taken hold of you.... or come upon you as yet, but what is human, or incident to man. Issue.... or a way to escape.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	15	I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	16	The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? Which we bless.... Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, ver. 21, that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils by eating of the meats sacrificed to them.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	17	For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread. One bread.... or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread. For it is by our communicating with Christ, and with one another, in this blessed sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	18	Behold Israel according to the flesh. Are not they that eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	19	What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? Or that the idol is any thing?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	20	But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	21	You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me: but all things are not expedient.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	23	All things are lawful for me: but all things do not edify.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but that which is another’s.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat: asking no question for conscience’ sake.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	26	The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	27	If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you be willing to go: eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	28	But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols: do not eat of it, for his sake that told it and for conscience’ sake.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	29	Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	30	If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	31	Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	32	Be without offence to the Jew, and to the Gentiles and to the church of God:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	33	As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself but to many: that they may be saved. 1 Corinthians Chapter 11 Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	1	Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	6	For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	7	The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	9	For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	10	Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels. A power.... that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	11	But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	13	You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	15	But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	17	Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	18	For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	19	For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you. There must be also heresies.... By reason of the pride and perversity of man’s heart; not by God’s will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	20	When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper. The Lord’s supper.... So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	21	For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	22	What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	24	And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	25	In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	26	For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	27	Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. Or drink.... Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink. Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc.... This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord’s body.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	28	But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. Drink of the chalice.... This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	30	Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	31	But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	32	But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	34	If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. 1 Corinthians Chapter 12 Of the diversity of spiritual gifts. The members of the mystical body, like those of the natural body, must mutually cherish one another.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	2	You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	3	Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	4	Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	5	And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	7	And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	8	To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	9	To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	10	To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of speeches.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	11	But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	12	For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	14	For the body also is not one member, but many.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	15	If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	16	And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	17	If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	18	But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	19	And if they all were one member, where would be the body?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	20	But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	21	And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	22	Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are more necessary.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	23	And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	24	But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	25	That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually careful one for another.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	26	And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	28	And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	30	Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	31	But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way. 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	2	And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	3	And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	4	Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	5	Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	8	Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	9	For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	12	We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	13	And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity. 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 The gift of prophesying is to be preferred before that of speaking strange tongues.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	1	Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy. Prophesy.... That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	2	For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries. Not unto men.... Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	4	He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	5	And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	7	Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	9	So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	10	There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	11	If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	12	So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church. Of spirits.... Of spiritual gifts.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	13	And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without fruit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	16	Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou sayest. Amen.... The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	17	For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	18	I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	19	But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	20	Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and in sense be perfect.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	21	In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	23	If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	25	The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	26	How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	27	If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	29	And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	30	But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	31	For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	33	For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	34	Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	35	But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	36	Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	37	If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	38	But if any man know not, he shall not be known.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with tongues.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	14	40	But let all things be done decently and according to order. 1 Corinthians Chapter 15 Christ’s resurrection and ours. The manner of our resurrection.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	1	Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	2	By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	4	And that he was buried: and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	5	And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	6	Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	7	After that, he was seen by James: then by all the apostles.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	8	And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	10	But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me hath not been void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	11	For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have believed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	12	Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	14	And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith is also vain.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	16	For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	17	And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain: for you are yet in your sins.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	18	Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	20	But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	21	For by a man came death: and by a man the resurrection of the dead.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	22	And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	23	But every one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ: then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	24	Afterwards the end: when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father: when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	25	For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	26	And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	27	All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. The Son also himself shall be subject unto him.... That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	29	Otherwise, what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then baptized for them? That are baptized for the dead.... Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	30	Why also are we in danger every hour?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	31	I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	32	If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Let us eat and drink, etc.... That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	33	Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	34	Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak it to your shame.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	35	But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? Or with what manner of body shall they come?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	36	Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be: but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	38	But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	40	And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	41	One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption: it shall rise in incorruption.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	43	It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness: it shall rise in power.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	44	It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	45	The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	46	Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	47	The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	48	Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	49	Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible. And we shall be changed.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	54	And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	55	O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	56	Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	57	But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 16 Of collection of alms. Admonitions and salutations.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	1	Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints: as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	2	On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him: that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	3	And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	4	And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	5	Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	6	And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way: for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus, until Pentecost.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	9	For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	10	Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct ye him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I look for him with the brethren.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	12	And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	13	Watch ye: stand fast in the faith: do manfully and be strengthened.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	14	Let all your things be done in charity.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	15	And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	16	That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	17	And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	18	For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	20	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	21	The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	22	If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha. Let him be anathema, maranatha.... Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, ‘The Lord is come’ already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha: ‘May our Lord come’, that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	15
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	16	24	My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.	15
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	1	Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ: to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	2	Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	3	As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	4	By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises: that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature: flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	5	And you, employing all care, minister in your faith, virtue: And in virtue, knowledge:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	6	And in knowledge, abstinence: and in abstinence, patience: and in patience, godliness:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	7	And in godliness, love of brotherhood: and in love of brotherhood, charity.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	8	For if these things be with you and abound, they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	9	For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	10	Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the ever-lasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	12	For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the present truth.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	13	But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	14	Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	15	And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease whereby you may keep a memory of these things.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	16	For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ: but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	18	And this voice, we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	19	And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	20	Understanding this first: That no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation.... This shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one’s private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world. Some may tell us, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures: they may do so, but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	1	21	For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter Chapter 2 He warns them against false teachers and foretells their punishment.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	1	But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction. Seeds of perdition.... That is, heresies destructive of salvation.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	2	And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not: and their perdition slumbereth not.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	5	And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	6	And reducing the cities of the Sodomites and of the Gomorrhites into ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to those that should after act wickedly,	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	7	And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	8	For in sight and hearing he was just, dwelling among them who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	10	And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government: audacious, self willed, they fear not to bring in sects, blaspheming.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	11	Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment. Bring not a railing judgment, etc.... That is, they use no railing, nor cursing sentence; not even in their conflicts with the evil angels. See St. Jude, ver. 9.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	12	But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	13	Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day: stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in their feasts with you: The delights of a day: that is, the short delights of this world, in which they place all their happiness.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not: alluring unstable souls: having their heart exercised with covetousness: children of malediction.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	15	Leaving the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor who loved the wages of iniquity,	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	16	But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which, speaking with man’s voice, forbade the folly of the prophet.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	17	These are fountains without water and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	18	For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape, such as converse in error:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	19	Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	20	For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and overcome: their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	2	22	For, that of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog is returned to his vomit; and: The sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. 2 Peter Chapter 3 Against scoffers denying the second coming of Christ. He declares the sudden dissolution of this world and exhorts to holiness of life.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	1	Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which, I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	2	That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy prophets, and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord and Saviour.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	3	Knowing this first: That in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	4	Saying: Where is his promise or his coming? For since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	5	For this they are wilfully ignorant of: That the heavens were before, and the earth out of water and through water, consisting by the word of God:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	7	But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the ungodly men.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	8	But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	9	The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance,	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	10	But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burnt up.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	11	Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the burning heat?	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	13	But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice dwelleth.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	14	Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	15	And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation: as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	17	You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own steadfastness.	16
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PETER THE APOSTLE	3	18	But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity, Amen.	16
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	2	To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	3	As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	4	Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which furnish questions rather than the edification of God which is in faith.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	6	From which things some, going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law: understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	9	Knowing this: That the law is not made for the just man but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, The law is not.... He means, that the just man doth good, and avoideth evil, not as compelled by the law, and merely for fear of the punishment appointed for transgressors; but voluntarily, and out of the love of God and virtue; and would do so, though there were no law.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	10	For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	11	Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God which hath been committed to my trust.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	12	I give him thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	13	Who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	14	Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	15	A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	16	But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	17	Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	18	This precept, I commend to thee, O son Timothy: according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	19	Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	1	20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 1 Timothy Chapter 2 Prayers are to be said for all men, because God wills the salvation of all. Women are not to teach.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	1	I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	2	For kings and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	5	For there is one God: and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: One mediator.... Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	6	Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times. A redemption for all.... He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	7	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle (I say the truth, I lie not), a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	8	I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	9	In like manner, women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	10	But, as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence. 2:13.For Adam was first formed; then Eve.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	14	And Adam was not seduced; but the woman, being seduced, was in the transgression.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	2	15	Yet she shall be saved through child bearing; if she continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety. 1 Timothy Chapter 3 What sort of men are to be admitted into the clergy. The church is the pillar of truth.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	1	A faithful saying: If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	2	It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher, Of one wife.... The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife (for St. Paul himself had none), but that no one should be admitted to the holy orders of bishop, priest, or deacon, who had been married more than once.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	3	Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	5	But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	6	Not a neophyte: lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil. A neophyte.... That is, one lately baptized, a young convert.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	7	Moreover, he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	8	Deacons in like manner: chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	9	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	10	And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	11	The women in like manner: chaste, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in all things.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children and their own houses.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	13	For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a good degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	14	These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee shortly.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. The pillar and ground of the truth.... Therefore the church of the living God can never uphold error, nor bring in corruptions, superstition, or idolatry.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	3	16	And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory. 1 Timothy Chapter 4 He warns him against heretics, and exhorts him to the exercise of piety.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	1	Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	3	Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have known the truth. Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats.... He speaks of the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all kind of meat; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage, holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow have chosen the better part: and prohibits not the use of any meats whatsoever in proper times and seasons; though she does not judge all kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	6	These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	7	But avoid foolish and old wives fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	8	For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	9	A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	10	For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	11	These things command and teach:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	13	Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	14	Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	15	Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	4	16	Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee. 1 Timothy Chapter 5 He gives him lessons concerning widows, and how he is to behave to his clergy.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	1	An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	2	Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	4	But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her parents; for this is acceptable before God.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	5	But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	6	For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	7	And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	8	But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	9	Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	10	Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	11	But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	12	Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith. Their first faith.... Their vow, by which they had engaged themselves to Christ.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	13	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	14	I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	16	If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	17	Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	18	For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	19	Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	20	Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	21	I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	22	Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	23	Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent infirmities.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	24	Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	5	25	In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. 1 Timothy Chapter 6 Duties of servants. The danger of covetousness. Lessons for the rich.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	1	Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be blasphemed.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	2	But they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	3	If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	5	Conflicts of men corrupted in mind and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	8	But having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	9	For they that will become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	10	For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	11	But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	13	I charge thee before God who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	14	That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings and Lord of lords:	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	16	Who only hath immortality and inhabiteth light inaccessible: whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting. Amen.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	17	Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy)	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	18	To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to others,	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	19	To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO TIMOTHY	6	21	Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.	17
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	1	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians: in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	2	Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all: making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	3	Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity: and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	4	Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	5	For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	6	And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	7	So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	8	For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	9	For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2 The sincerity of the apostle’s preaching the gospel to them and of their receiving it.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	1	For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	2	But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	3	For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	4	But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	5	For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	6	Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	7	Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	8	So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	9	For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	10	You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame we have been to you that have believed:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	11	As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	12	We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	13	Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	14	For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	16	Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end. To fill up their sins.... That is, to fill up the measure of their sins, after which God’s justice would punish them. For the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.... That is, to continue on them to the end.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	18	For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	19	For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	20	For you are our glory and joy. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3 The apostle’s concern and love for the Thessalonians.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	1	For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	2	And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	3	That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	4	For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	5	For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	6	But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	7	Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	8	Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	9	For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	10	Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	11	Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	12	And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	13	To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity. He treats of the resurrection of the dead.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	1	For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus that, as you have received from us, how you ought to walk and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	2	For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should abstain from fornication:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour,	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	5	Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	6	And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before and have testified.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	8	Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	9	But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	10	For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	11	And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your own business and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any man’s.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	12	And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	13	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	14	For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	15	For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ shall rise first.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	16	Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air: and so shall we be always with the Lord.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	4	17	Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5 The day of the Lord shall come when least expected. Exhortations to several duties.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	1	But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you:	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	3	For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	5	For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we are not of the night nor of darkness.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	6	Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be sober.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	7	For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast plate of faith and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	9	For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	10	Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	11	For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you also do.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you;	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	13	That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have peace with them.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	14	And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the feeble minded: support the weak: be patient towards all men. The unquiet.... That is, such as are irregular and disorderly.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	15	See that none render evil for evil to any man: but ever follow that which is good towards each other and towards all men.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	16	Always rejoice.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	18	In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	19	Extinguish not the spirit.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	20	Despise not prophecies.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	21	But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	22	From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	23	And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things: that your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	24	He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	26	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.	18
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.	18
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	1	In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	2	When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	3	Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	4	That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	5	And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	6	And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	7	And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king’s magnificence.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	8	Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	9	Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	10	Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	11	To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	12	But she refused, and would not come at the king’s commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	13	Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	14	(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	15	What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	16	And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	17	For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	18	And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king’s indignation is just.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	19	If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	20	And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	21	His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	1	22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people. Esther Chapter 2 Esther is advanced to be queen. Mardochai detecteth a plot against the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	1	After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	2	And the king’s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	3	And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king’s women: and let them receive women’s ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	4	And whosoever among them all shall please the king’s eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	5	There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	7	And he had brought up his brother’s daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	8	And when the king’s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	9	And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women’s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king’s house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	10	And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	11	And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Esther’s welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	12	Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	13	And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king’s chamber.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	14	And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king’s concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	15	And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	16	So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	18	And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	19	And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king’s gate,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	20	Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	21	At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king’s gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	22	And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai’s name, who had reported the thing unto her.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	2	23	It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king. Esther Chapter 3 Aman, advanced by the king, is offended at Mardochai, and therefore procureth the king’s decree to destroy the whole nation of the Jews.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	1	After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	2	And all the king’s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	3	And the king’s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king’s commandment?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	4	And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	5	Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	6	And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	7	In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	8	And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	9	If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	10	And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	11	And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	12	And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	13	Were sent by the king’s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	14	And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	3	15	The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king’s commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping. Esther Chapter 4 Mardochai desireth Esther to petition the king for the Jews. They join in fasting and prayer.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	1	Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	2	And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king’s court.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	3	And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king’s cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	4	Then Esther’s maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	5	And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	6	And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	7	And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king’s treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	8	He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	9	And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	10	She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	11	All the king’s servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king’s inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	12	And when Mardochai had heard this,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	13	He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king’s house, more than all the Jews:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	14	For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father’s house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	15	And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	16	Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	4	17	So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him. Esther Chapter 5 Esther is graciously received: she inviteth the king and Aman to dinner, Aman prepareth a gibbet for Mardochai.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	1	And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	2	And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	3	And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	4	But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	5	And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther’s will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	6	And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	7	And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	8	If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	9	So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	10	But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	11	And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	12	And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	13	And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king’s gate.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	5	14	Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared. Esther Chapter 6 The king hearing of the good service done him by Mardochai, commandeth Aman to honour him next to the king, which he performeth.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	1	That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	2	They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	3	And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all. No reward at all.... He received some presents from the king, chap. 12.5; but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers, that they esteemed them as nothing at all.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	4	And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king’s house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	5	The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	6	And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	7	Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	8	Ought to be clothed with the king’s apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	9	And let the first of the king’s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	10	And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	11	So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	12	But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	13	And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	6	14	As they were yet speaking, the king’s eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared. Esther Chapter 7 Esther’s petition for herself and her people: Aman is hanged upon the gibbet he had prepared for Mardochai.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	1	So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	2	And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	3	Then she answered: If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	4	For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	5	And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	6	And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	7	But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	8	And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king’s mouth, and immediately they covered his face.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	9	And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman’s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	7	10	So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king’s wrath ceased. Esther Chapter 8 Mardochai is advanced: Aman’s letters are reversed.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	1	On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	2	And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	3	And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	4	But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	5	And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king’s provinces, may be reversed by new letters.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	6	For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	7	And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman’s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	8	Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king’s name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king’s name, and were sealed with his ring.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	9	Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	10	And these letters which were sent in the king’s name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	11	And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	12	And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	13	And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	14	So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king’s edict was hung up in Susan.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	15	And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king’s presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced, and was glad.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	16	But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	8	17	And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: Insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all. Esther Chapter 9 The Jews kill their enemies that would have killed them. The days of Phurim are appointed to be kept holy.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	1	So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries. To revenge, etc.... The Jews on this occasion, by authority from the king, were made executioners of the public justice, for punishing by death a crime worthy of death, viz., a malicious conspiracy for extirpating their whole nation.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	2	And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	3	And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	4	For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men’s mouths.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	5	So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	6	Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	7	Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	8	And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	9	And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	10	And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	11	And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	12	And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	13	And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	14	And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	15	And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	16	Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king’s dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	17	Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	18	But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	19	But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	20	And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king’s provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	21	That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	22	Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	23	And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	24	For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	25	And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king’s letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	26	And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	27	And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	28	These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	29	And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	30	And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	31	And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	9	32	And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther. Esther Chapter 10 Assuerus’s greatness. Mardochai’s dignity.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	1	And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	2	And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	3	And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	4	Then Mardochai said: God hath done these things. Then Mardochai, etc.... Here St. Jerome advertiseth the reader, that what follows is not in the Hebrew, but is found in the septuagint Greek edition, which the seventy-two interpreters translated out of the Hebrew, or added by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	5	I remember a dream that I saw, which signified these same things: and nothing thereof hath failed. A dream.... This dream was prophetical and extraordinary: otherwise the general rule is not to observe dreams.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	6	The little fountain which grew into a river, and was turned into a light, and into the sun, and abounded into many waters, is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	7	But the two dragons are I and Aman.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	8	The nations that were assembled are they that endeavoured to destroy the name of the Jews.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	9	And my nation is Israel, who cried to the Lord, and the Lord saved his people: and he delivered us from all evils, and hath wrought great signs and wonders among the nations:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	10	And he commanded that there should be two lots, one of the people of God, and the other of all the nations.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	11	And both lots came to the day appointed already from that time before God to all nations:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	12	And the Lord remembered his people, and had mercy on his inheritance.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	10	13	And these days shall be observed in the month of Adar on the fourteenth, and fifteenth day of the same month, with all diligence, and joy of the people gathered into one assembly, throughout all the generations hereafter of the people of Israel. Esther Chapter 11 The dream of Mardochai, which in the ancient Greek and Latin Bibles was into the beginning of the book, but was detached by St. Jerome, and put in this place.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	1	In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest, and of the Levitical race, and Ptolemy his son brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said Lysimachus the son of Ptolemy had interpreted in Jerusalem.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	2	In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardochai the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the tribe of Benjamin:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	3	A Jew who dwelt in the city of Susan, a great man and among the first of the king’s court, had a dream.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	4	Now he was of the number of the captives, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Juda:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	5	And this was his dream: Behold there were voices, and tumults, and thunders, and earthquakes, and a disturbance upon the earth.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	6	And behold two great dragons came forth ready to fight one against another.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	7	And at their cry all nations were stirred up to fight against the nation of the just.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	8	And that was a day of darkness and danger, of tribulation and distress, and great fear upon the earth.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	9	And the nation of the just was troubled fearing their own evils, and was prepared for death.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	10	And they cried to God: and as they were crying, a little fountain grew into a very great river, and abounded into many waters.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	11	The light and the sun rose up, and the humble were exalted, and they devoured the glorious.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	11	12	And when Mardochai had seen this, and arose out of his bed, he was thinking what God would do: and he kept it fixed in his mind, desirous to know what the dream should signify. Esther Chapter 12 Mardochai detects the conspiracy of the two eunuchs.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	1	And he abode at that time in the king’s court with Bagatha and Thara the king’s eunuchs, who were porters of the palace.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	2	And when he understood their designs, and had diligently searched into their projects, he learned that they went about to lay violent hands on king Artaxerxes, and he told the king thereof.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	3	Then the king had them both examined, and after they had confessed, commanded them to be put to death.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	4	But the king made a record of what was done: and Mardochai also committed the memory of the thing to writing.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	5	And the king commanded him, to abide in the court of the palace, and gave him presents for the information.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	12	6	But Aman the son of Amadathi the Bugite was in great honour with the king, and sought to hurt Mardochai and his people, because of the two eunuchs of the king who were put to death. Esther Chapter 13 A copy of a letter sent by Aman to destroy the Jews. Mardochai’s prayer for the people.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	1	And this was the copy of the letter: Artaxerxes the great king who reigneth from India to Ethiopia, to the princes and governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, that are subject to his empire, greeting.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	2	Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly without any terror, and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all men,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	3	But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by name,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	4	Told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, despised the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	5	Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all mankind using perverse laws, and going against our commandments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	6	We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	7	That these wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	8	But Mardochai besought the Lord, remembering all his works,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	9	And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	10	Thou hast made heaven and earth and all things that are under the cope of heaven.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	11	Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	12	Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	13	(For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,)	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	14	But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	15	And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, because our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	16	Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	17	Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, O Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	13	18	And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads. Esther Chapter 14 The prayer of Esther for herself and her people.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	1	Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	2	And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	3	And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying: O my Lord, who alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	4	My danger is in my hands.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	5	I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	6	We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	7	For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	8	And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	9	They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	10	That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	11	Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	12	Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	13	Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	14	But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	15	And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	16	Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my pride and glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	17	And that I have not eaten at Aman’s table, nor hath the king’s banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink offerings:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	18	And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	14	19	O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear. Esther Chapter 15 Esther comes into the king’s presence: she is terrified, but God turns his heart.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	1	And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	2	Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	3	And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	4	And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her glorious apparel.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	5	And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	6	And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	7	And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the ground.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	8	But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	9	So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	10	And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	11	And God changed the king’s spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	12	What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	13	Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	14	Come near then, and touch the sceptre.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	15	And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	16	She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	17	For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	18	And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	15	19	But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. Esther Chapter 16 A copy of the king’s letter in favour of the Jews.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	1	The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting. From India to Ethiopia.... That is, who reigneth from India to Ethiopia.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	2	Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	3	And not only endeavour to oppress the king’s subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	4	Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	5	And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all men’s praise,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	6	While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	7	Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	8	Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	9	Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	10	Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	11	And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	12	But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	13	For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	14	Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	15	But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	16	And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	17	Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	18	For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	19	But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	20	And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	21	For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	22	Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	23	That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.	19
THE BOOK OF ESTHER	16	24	And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.	19
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	1	In the days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	2	He was named Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	3	And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	4	And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	5	And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	6	And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with both her daughters in law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people, and had given them food.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters in law: and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	8	She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	9	May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	10	And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	11	But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	12	Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	13	If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man’s estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother in law.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	15	And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her. To her gods, etc.... Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the false gods she had formerly worshipped: but by this manner of speech, insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her false gods and return to the Lord the God of Israel.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	16	She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	17	The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more also, if aught but death part me and thee. The Lord do so and so, etc.... A form of swearing usual in the history of the Old Testament, by which the person wished such and such evils to fall upon them, if they did not do what they said.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	18	Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	19	So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	20	But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful,) but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	21	I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted?	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	1	22	So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter in law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest. Ruth Chapter 2 Ruth gleaneth in the field of Booz, who sheweth her favour.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	1	Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	2	And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder, that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	3	She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	4	And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	5	And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	6	And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi, from the land of Moab,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	7	And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	8	And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	9	And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	10	She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a woman of another country?	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	11	And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	12	The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	13	And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	14	And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	15	And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	16	And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	17	She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	18	Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother in law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	19	And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned today, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man’s name, that he was called Booz.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	20	And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	21	And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	22	And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man’s field some one may resist thee.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	2	23	So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns. Ruth Chapter 3 Ruth instructed by her mother in law lieth at Booz’s feet, claiming him for her husband by the law of affinity: she receiveth a good answer, and six measures of barley.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	1	After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	2	This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	3	Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	4	And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	5	She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	6	And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	7	And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	8	And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	9	And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	10	And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich. Thy latter kindness, viz.... to thy husband deceased in seeking to keep up his name and family by marrying his relation according to the law, and not following after young men. For Booz, it seems, was then in years.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	11	Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	12	Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	13	Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	14	So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	15	And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	16	And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	17	And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	3	18	And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said. Ruth Chapter 4 Upon the refusal of the nearer kinsman, Booz marrieth Ruth, who bringeth forth Obed, the grandfather of David.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	1	Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	2	And Booz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	3	They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	4	I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	5	And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman’s hand, thou must take also Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	6	He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	7	Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	8	So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	9	And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and Chelion’s, and Mahalon’s, of the hand of Noemi:	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	10	And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	11	Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients, answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem: Ephrata.... Another name of Bethlehem.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	12	And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	13	Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	14	And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	15	And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	16	And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	17	And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	18	These are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esron,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	19	Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	20	Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	21	Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,	20
THE BOOK OF RUTH	4	22	Obed begot Isai, Isai begot David.	20
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	1	God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	2	In these days, hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high: The figure ... that is, the express image, and most perfect resemblance. Making purgation.... That is, having purged away our sins by his passion.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	5	For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	7	And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	8	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	9	Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	10	And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	11	They shall perish: but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. But thou art the selfsame: and thy years shall not fail.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation? Hebrews Chapter 2 The transgression of the precepts of the Son of God is far more condemnable than of those of the Old Testament given by angels.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	1	Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	4	God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	5	For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	6	But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	7	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy hands.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he might taste death for all.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	10	For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion. Perfect by his passion.... By suffering, Christ was to enter into his glory, Luke 24.26, which the apostle here calls being made perfect.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	12	I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	13	And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	14	Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	15	And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	16	For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold. No where doth he, etc.... That is, he never took upon him the nature of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	17	Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	2	18	For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he is able to succour them also that are tempted. Hebrews Chapter 3 Christ is more excellent than Moses. Wherefore we must adhere to him by faith and obedience.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	2	Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	4	For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	6	But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	7	Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the desert,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	9	Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	10	Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	11	As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	12	Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	13	But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	15	While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	16	For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	17	And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	18	And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	3	19	And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief. Hebrews Chapter 4 The Christian’s rest. We are to enter into it through Jesus Christ.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	1	Let us fear therefore lest, the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	2	For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	3	For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	4	For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	5	And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	6	Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	7	Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David; To day, after so long a time as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards spoken of another day. Jesus.... Josue, who in Greek is called Jesus.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	9	There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	11	Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	12	For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	13	Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	14	Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	15	For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	4	16	Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid. Hebrews Chapter 5 The office of a high priest. Christ is our high priest.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	2	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	3	And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	4	Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	5	So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	6	As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	8	And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	9	And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	10	Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	11	Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	12	For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	13	For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	5	14	But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil. Hebrews Chapter 6 He warns them of the danger of falling by apostasy and exhorts them to patience and perseverance.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	1	Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect: not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works and of faith towards God, The word of the beginning.... The first rudiments of the Christian doctrine.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, It is impossible, etc.... The meaning is, that it is impossible for such as have fallen after baptism, to be again baptized; and very hard for such as have apostatized from the faith, after having received many graces, to return again to the happy state from which they fell.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	5	Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	6	And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	7	For the earth, that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	8	But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and very near unto a curse: whose end is to be burnt.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	9	But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	10	For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered and do minister to the saints.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	11	And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	12	That you become not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	13	For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	14	Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I shall multiply thee.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	15	And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	17	Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	18	That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, we who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	19	Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	6	20	Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. Hebrews Chapter 7 The priesthood of Christ according to the order of Melchisedech excels the Levitical priesthood and puts an end both to that and to the law.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	1	For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	2	To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever. Without father, etc.... Not that he had no father, etc., but that neither his father, nor his pedigree, nor his birth, nor his death, are set down in scripture.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	4	Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	5	And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	6	But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	7	And without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the better.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	8	And here indeed, men that die receive tithes: but there, he hath witness that he liveth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	9	And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedech met him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	11	If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech: and not be called according to the order of Aaron?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	12	For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	16	Who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	17	For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	18	There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	19	For the law brought nothing to perfection: but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	20	And inasmuch as it is not without an oath (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	21	But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever).	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	23	And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue: Many priests, etc.... The apostle notes this difference between the high priests of the law, and our high priest Jesus Christ; that they being removed by death, made way for their successors; whereas our Lord Jesus is a priest for ever, and hath no successor; but liveth and concurreth for ever with his ministers, the priests of the new testament, in all their functions. Also, that no one priest of the law, nor all of them together, could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting redemption, which our one high priest Jesus Christ has offered once, and for ever.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	24	But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	25	Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us. Make intercession.... Christ, as man, continually maketh intercession for us, by representing his passion to his Father.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	27	Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	7	28	For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath (which was since the law) the Son who is perfected for evermore. Hebrews Chapter 8 More of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ and of the New Testament.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	2	A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. The holies.... That is, the sanctuary.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	4	If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law. If then he were on earth, etc.... That is, if he were not of a higher condition than the Levitical order of earthly priests, and had not another kind of sacrifice to offer, he should be excluded by them from the priesthood, and its functions, which by the law were appropriated to their tribe.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount. Who serve unto, etc.... The priesthood of the law and its functions were a kind of an example and shadow of what is done by Christ in his church militant and triumphant, of which the tabernacle was a pattern.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	6	But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament which is established on better promises.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	7	For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	8	For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	9	Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	10	For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them. They shall not teach, etc.... So great shall be light and grace of the new testament, that it shall not be necessary to inculcate to the faithful the belief and knowledge of the true God, for they shall all know him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	12	Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember no more.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	8	13	Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end. A new.... Supply ‘covenant’. Hebrews Chapter 9 The sacrifices of the law were far inferior to that of Christ.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	1	The former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks and the table and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the Holy.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	4	Having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna and the rod of Aaron that had blossomed and the tables of the testament.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	5	And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	6	Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle, the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	7	But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own and the people’s ignorance:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	8	The Holy Ghost signifying this: That the way into the Holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	9	Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	10	And divers washings and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction. Of correction.... Viz., when Christ should correct and settle all things.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	11	But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption. Eternal redemption.... By that one sacrifice of his blood, once offered on the cross, Christ our Lord paid and exhibited, once for all, the general price and ransom of all mankind: which no other priest could do.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	13	For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer, being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	15	And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	16	For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of necessity come in.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	18	Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	19	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	20	Saying: This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	21	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	22	And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	23	It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	24	For Jesus is not entered into the Holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into Heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the Holies every year with the blood of others: Offer himself often.... Christ shall never more offer himself in sacrifice, in that violent, painful, and bloody manner, nor can there be any occasion for it: since by that one sacrifice upon the cross, he has furnished the full ransom, redemption, and remedy for all the sins of the world. But this hinders not that he may offer himself daily in the sacred mysteries in an unbloody manner, for the daily application of that one sacrifice of redemption to our souls.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	26	For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world. But now once, at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	9	28	So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many. The second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation. To exhaust.... That is, to empty, or draw out to the very bottom, by a plentiful and perfect redemption. Hebrews Chapter 10 Because of the insufficiency of the sacrifices of the law, Christ our high priest shed his own blood for us, offering up once for all the sacrifice of our redemption. He exhorts them to perseverance.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	2	For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer. They would have ceased.... If they had been of themselves perfect to all the intents of redemption and remission, as Christ’s death is there would have been no occasion of so often repeating them: as there is no occasion for Christ’s dying any more for our sins.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	3	But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	4	For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	5	Wherefore, when he cometh into the world he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	6	Holocausts for sin did not please thee.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	7	Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	8	In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	9	Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: He taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	10	In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	11	And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	12	But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	13	From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	14	For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	15	And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	16	And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts and on their minds will I write them:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	17	And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	18	Now, where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin. There is no more an oblation for sin.... Where there is a full remission of sins, as in baptism, there is no more occasion for a sin offering to be made for such sins already remitted; and as for sins committed afterwards, they can only be remitted in virtue of the one oblation of Christ’s death.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	20	A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	21	And a high priest over the house of God:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised):	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	24	And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	25	Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed: but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins: If we sin wilfully.... He speaks of the sin of wilful apostasy from the known truth; after which, as we can not be baptized again, we can not expect to have that abundant remission of sins, which Christ purchased by his death, applied to our souls in that ample manner as it is in baptism: but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful judgment; the more because apostates from the known truth, seldom or never have the grace to return to it.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	27	But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	28	A man making void the law of Moses dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	29	How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	30	For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	32	But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	33	And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	34	For you both had compassion on them that were in bands and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	35	Do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	36	For patience is necessary for you: that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	37	For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come will come and will not delay.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	38	But my just man liveth by faith: but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	10	39	But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul. Hebrews Chapter 11 What faith is. Its wonderful fruits and efficacy demonstrated in the fathers.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	1	Now, faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	2	For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	3	By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God: that from invisible things visible things might be made.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts. And by it he being dead yet speaketh.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	5	By faith Henoch was translated that he should not see death: and he was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is: and is a rewarder to them that seek him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	7	By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house: by the which he condemned the world and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	8	By faith he that is called Abraham obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing whither he went. He that is called Abraham ... or, Abraham being called.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	9	By faith he abode in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	10	For he looked for a city that hath foundations: whose builder and maker is God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	11	By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive seed, even past the time of age: because she believed that he was faithful who had promised,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	12	For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	13	All these died according to faith, not having received the promises but beholding them afar off and saluting them and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	14	For they that say these things do signify that they seek a country.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they had doubtless, time to return.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	16	But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	18	(To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called:)	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	19	Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Whereupon also he received him for a parable. For a parable.... That is, as a figure of Christ, slain and coming to life again.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	20	By faith also of things to come Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	21	By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and adored the top of his rod. Adored the top of his rod.... The apostle here follows the ancient Greek Bible of the seventy interpreters, (which translates in this manner, Gen. 47. 31.,) and alleges this fact of Jacob, in paying a relative honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of Joseph, as to a figure of Christ’s sceptre and kingdom, as an instance and argument of his faith. But some translators, who are no friends to this relative honour, have corrupted the text, by translating it, he worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff; as if this circumstance of leaning upon his staff were any argument of Jacob’s faith, or worthy the being thus particularly taken notice of by the Holy Ghost.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents: because they saw he was a comely babe, and they feared not the king’s edict.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	24	By faith Moses, when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of Pharao’s daughter:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	25	Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God than to have the pleasure of sin for a time:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians. For he looked unto the reward.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king: for he endured, as seeing him that is invisible.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	28	By faith he celebrated the pasch and the shedding of the blood: that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting, were swallowed up.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, by the going round them seven days.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	32	And what shall I yet say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, Barac, Samson, Jephthe, David, Samuel, and the prophets:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	33	Who by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle, put to flight the armies of foreigners.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again. But others were racked, not accepting deliverance, that they might find a better resurrection.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	36	And others had trial of mockeries and stripes: moreover also of bands and prisons.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	37	They were stoned, they were cut asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	38	Of whom the world was not worthy: wandering in deserts, in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	39	And all these, being approved by the testimony of faith, received not the promise:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	11	40	God providing some better thing for us, that they should not be perfected without us. Hebrews Chapter 12 Exhortation to constancy under their crosses. The danger of abusing the graces of the New Testament.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	1	And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over our head, laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	2	Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who, having joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	3	For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	4	For you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	5	And you have forgotten the consolation which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord: neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chastiseth: and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	7	Persevere under discipline. God dealeth with you as with his sons. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	8	But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made partakers, then are you bastards and not sons.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	9	Moreover, we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them. Shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits and live?	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	10	And they indeed for a few days, according to their own pleasure, instructed us: but he, for our profit, that we might receive his sanctification.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	11	Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy, but sorrow: but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it the most peaceable fruit of justice.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	12	Wherefore, lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	13	And make straight steps with your feet: that no one, halting, may go out of the way; but rather be healed.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	14	Follow peace with all men and holiness: without which no man shall see God.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	15	Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder and by it many be defiled:	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau who for one mess sold his first birthright.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	17	For know ye that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the benediction, he was rejected. For he found no place of repentance, although with tears he had sought it. He found, etc.... That is, he found no way to bring his father to repent, or change his mind, with relation to his having given the blessing to his younger brother Jacob.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	18	For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched and a burning fire and a whirlwind and darkness and storm,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	19	And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which they that heard excused themselves, that the word might not be spoken to them.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	20	For they did not endure that which was said: and if so much as a beast shall touch the mount, it shall be stoned.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	21	And so terrible was that which was seen, Moses said: I am frighted, and tremble.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	22	But you are come to mount Sion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of angels,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	23	And to the church of the firstborn who are written in the heavens, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new testament, and to the sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of Abel.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	25	See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon earth, much more shall not we that turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	26	Whose voice then moved the earth; but now he promiseth, saying: Yet once more: and I will move, not only the earth, but heaven also.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	27	And in that he saith: Yet once more, he signifieth the translation of the moveable things as made, that those things may remain which are immoveable.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	28	Therefore, receiving an immoveable kingdom, we have grace: whereby let us serve, pleasing God, with fear and reverence.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire. Hebrews Chapter 13 Divers admonitions and exhortations.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	1	Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	2	And hospitality do not forget: for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	3	Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them: and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	4	Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge. Or, Let marriage be honourable in all.... That is, in all things belonging to the marriage state. This is a warning to married people, not to abuse the sanctity of their state, by any liberties or irregularities contrary thereunto. Now it does not follow from this text that all persons are obliged to marry, even if the word omnibus were rendered, in all persons, instead of in all things: for if it was a precept, St. Paul himself would have transgressed it, as he never married. Moreover, those who have already made a vow to God to lead a single life, should they attempt to marry, they would incur their own damnation. 1 Tim. 5. 12.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	5	Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have. For he hath said: I will not leave thee: neither will I forsake thee.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	6	So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	7	Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	8	Jesus Christ, yesterday, and today: and the same for ever.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	9	Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats: which have not profited those that walk in them.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	10	We have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	13	Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach. Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.... That is, bearing his cross. It is an exhortation to them to be willing to suffer with Christ, reproaches, persecutions, and even death, if they desire to partake of the benefit of his suffering for man’s redemption.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	14	For, we have not here a lasting city: but we seek one that is to come.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	16	And do not forget to do good and to impart: for by such sacrifices God’s favour is obtained.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	17	Obey your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls: that they may do this with joy and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	18	Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	19	And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	20	And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	21	Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	22	And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	24	Salute all your prelates and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS	13	25	Grace be with you all. Amen.	21
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	2	Grace be to you and peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ: In heavenly places.... or, in heavenly things. In coelestibus.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	4	As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	5	Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself: according to the purpose of his will:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	6	Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us, in his beloved son.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his, grace,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	8	Which hath superabounded in us, in all wisdom and prudence,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	9	That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	10	In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	11	In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	12	That we may be unto the praise of his glory: we who before hoped in Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	13	In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation), in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	14	Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory. Acquisition.... that is, a purchased possession.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	15	Wherefore, I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus and of your love towards all the saints,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	18	The eyes of your heart enlightened that you may know what the hope is of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	20	Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the dead and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	21	Above all principality and power and virtue and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	22	And he hath subjected all things under his feet and hath made him head over all the church,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	1	23	Which is his body and the fulness of him who is filled all in all. Ephesians Chapter 2 All our good comes through Christ. He is our peace.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	1	And you, when you were dead in your offences and sins,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	2	Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	3	In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	4	But God (who is rich in mercy) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in Christ (by whose grace you are saved)	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	6	And hath raised us up together and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places, through Christ Jesus.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	7	That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace, in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	8	For by grace you are saved through faith: and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	9	Not of works, that no man may glory. Not of works.... as of our own growth, or from ourselves; but as from the grace of God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	11	For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	12	That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise and without God in this world.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	15	Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees: that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	16	And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	17	And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off: and peace to them that were nigh.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	18	For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	19	Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners: but you are fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	20	Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	21	In whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	2	22	In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit. Ephesians Chapter 3 The mystery hidden from former ages was discovered to the apostle, to be imparted to the Gentiles. He prays that they may be strengthened in God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	1	For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	2	If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	3	How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	4	As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	5	Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	6	That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body: and copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	7	Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	8	To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	9	And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God who created all things:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	10	That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	11	According to the eternal purpose which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	13	Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	15	Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named: All paternity.... Or, the whole family. God is the Father, both of angels and men; whosoever besides is named father, is so named with subordination to him.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	17	That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts: that, being rooted and founded in charity,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	18	You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	19	To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge: that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	20	Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	3	21	To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, unto all generations, world without end. Amen. Ephesians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to unity, to put on the new man, and to fly sin.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	1	I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	2	With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	3	Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	4	One body and one Spirit: as you are called in one hope of your calling.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	6	One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	7	But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	8	Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts to men.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	9	Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens: that he might fill all things.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	11	And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors: Gave some apostles—Until we all meet, etc.... Here it is plainly expressed, that Christ has left in his church a perpetual succession of orthodox pastors and teachers, to preserve the faithful in unity and truth.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	13	Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	14	That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	15	But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	16	From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	17	This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	18	Having their understanding darkened: being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	19	Who despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	20	But you have not so learned Christ:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	21	If so be that you have heard him and have been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	22	To put off, according to former conversation, the old man, who is corrupted according to the desire of error.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	24	And put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	25	Wherefore, putting away lying, speak ye the truth, every man with his neighbour. For we are members one of another.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	26	Be angry: and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	27	Give not place to the devil.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	28	He that stole, let him now steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	29	Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth: but that which is good, to the edification of faith: that it may administer grace to the hearers.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	31	Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and blasphemy be put away from you, with all malice.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	4	32	And be ye kind one to another: merciful, forgiving one another, even as God hath forgiven you in Christ. Ephesians Chapter 5 Exhortations to a virtuous life. The mutual duties of man and wife, by the example of Christ and of the Church.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	3	But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	4	Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	5	For know you this and understand: That no fornicator or unclean or covetous person (which is a serving of idols) hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	7	Be ye not therefore partakers with them.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	8	For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	9	For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	10	Proving what is well pleasing to God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness: but rather reprove them.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	12	For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for all that is made manifest is light.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	14	Wherefore he saith: Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	15	See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	16	But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	17	Wherefore, become not unwise: but understanding what is the will of God.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury: but be ye filled with the Holy Spirit,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	21	Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	22	Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	23	Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject to Christ: so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. As the church is subject to Christ.... The church then, according to St. Paul, is ever obedient to Christ, and can never fall from him, but remain faithful to him, unspotted and unchanged to the end of the world.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	26	That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	27	That he might present it to himself, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	28	So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	29	For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	30	Because we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother: and shall cleave to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	32	This is a great sacrament: but I speak in Christ and in the church.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	5	33	Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: And let the wife fear her husband. Ephesians Chapter 6 Duties of children and servants. The Christian’s armour.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is just.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	2	Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	4	And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger: but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	6	Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men: but, as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	7	With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	9	And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings: knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven. And there is no respect of persons with him.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	10	Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord and in the might of his power.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	11	Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places. High places, or heavenly places.... That is to say, in the air, the lowest of the celestial regions; in which God permits these wicked spirits or fallen angels to wander.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	13	Therefore, take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day and to stand in all things perfect.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of justice:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	16	In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	17	And take unto you the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	18	By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit: and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	19	And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel,	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in a chain: so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	21	But that you also may know the things that concern me and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	22	Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose: that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	23	Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS	6	24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen. In incorruption.... That is, with a pure and perfect love.	22
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	1	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians. In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	2	Grace unto you: and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	3	We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you towards each other aboundeth.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	4	So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations: which you endure	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	5	For an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	6	Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them that trouble you:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	7	And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	8	In a flame of fire, giving vengeance to them who know not God and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	9	Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction, from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his power:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be made wonderful in all them who have believed; because our testimony was believed upon you in that day.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you: That our God would make you worthy of his vocation and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith in power:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	1	12	That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2 The day of the Lord is not to come till the man of sin be revealed. The apostle’s traditions are to be observed.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	1	And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and of our gathering together unto him:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	2	That you be not easily moved from your sense nor be terrified, neither by spirit nor by word nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, A revolt.... This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the ancient fathers, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church; which has, in part, happened already, by means of Mahomet, Luther, &c., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the Antichrist. The man of sin.... Here must be meant some particular man, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article: o`, ‘the’ man of sin, ‘the’ son of perdition, ‘the’ adversary or opposer. It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the world.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	4	Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God. In the temple.... Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will rebuild; or in some Christian church, which he will pervert to his own worship: as Mahomet has done by the churches of the east.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	5	Remember you not that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	6	And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity already worketh: only that he who now holdeth do hold, until he be taken out of the way.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	8	And then that wicked one shall be revealed: whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: him	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	9	Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power and signs and lying wonders:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	10	And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish: because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying: God shall send.... That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	11	That all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have consented to iniquity.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	12	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit and faith of the truth:	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	13	Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	14	Therefore, brethren, stand fast: and hold the traditions, which you have learned, whether by word or by our epistle. Traditions.... See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be received than their epistles.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	15	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope in grace,	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	2	16	Exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word. 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3 He begs their prayers and warns them against idleness.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	1	For the rest, brethren, pray for us that the word of God may run and may be glorified, even as among you: May run.... That is, may spread itself, and have free course.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	2	And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men: for all men have not faith.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	3	But God is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	4	And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord that the things which we command, you both do and will do.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	5	And the Lord direct your hearts, in the charity of God and the patience of Christ.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	6	And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	7	For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us. For we were not disorderly among you.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing: but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	9	Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	10	For also, when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	11	For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly: working not at all, but curiously meddling.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	12	Now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	13	But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	15	Yet do not esteem him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	17	The salutation of Paul with my own hand: which is the sign in every epistle. So I write.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.	23
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	2	Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	6	Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	7	That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	8	For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation which came to us in Asia: that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	9	But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	10	Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	11	You helping withal in prayer for us. That for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	12	For our glory is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	13	For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	14	As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory: as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	15	And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia: and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	17	Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	18	But God is faithful: for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not: It is and It is not. But, It is, was in him. It is, was in him.... There was no inconstancy in the doctrine of the apostles, sometimes, like modern sectaries, saying, It is, and at other times saying, It is not. But their doctrine was ever the same, one uniform yea, in Jesus Christ, one Amen, that is, one truth in him.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	20	For all the promises of God are in him, It is. Therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	21	Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ and that hath anointed us, is God:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	22	Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	1	23	But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy. For in faith you stand. 2 Corinthians Chapter 2 He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	1	But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	2	For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	3	And I wrote this same to you: that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	5	And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me: but in part, that I may not burden you all.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	6	To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	7	So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	8	Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your charity towards him.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	9	For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	10	And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ: I also.... The apostle here granted an indulgence, or pardon, in the person and by the authority of Christ, to the incestuous Corinthian, whom before he had put under penance, which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his sin.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	11	That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	12	And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	14	Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	15	For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved and in them that perish.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	16	To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? The odour of death, etc.... The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	2	17	For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God: but with sincerity: but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 He needs no commendatory letters. The glory of the ministry of the New Testament.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	2	You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	3	Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written: not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	4	And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	5	Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	6	Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter but in the spirit. For the letter killeth: but the spirit quickeneth. The letter.... Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	7	Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious (so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance), which is made void:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	10	For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	12	Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	13	And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	14	But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	15	But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	16	But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	17	Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	3	18	But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians Chapter 4 The sincerity of his preaching. His comfort in his afflictions.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	2	But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God: but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience, in the sight of God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	3	And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord: and ourselves your servants through Jesus.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God and not of us.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	8	In all things we suffer tribulation: but are not distressed. We are straitened: but are not destitute.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	9	We suffer persecution: but are not forsaken. We are cast down: but we perish not.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	10	Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake: that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	12	So then death worketh in us: but life in you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe. For which cause we speak also:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	14	Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and place us with you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	15	For all things are for your sakes: that the grace, abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	16	For which cause we faint not: but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	17	For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure, exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal: but the things which are not seen, are eternal. 2 Corinthians Chapter 5 He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord. His charity to the Corinthians.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	1	For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	2	For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	3	Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	4	For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	5	Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	6	Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	7	(For we walk by faith and not by sight.)	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	8	But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	9	And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	10	For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. The proper things of the body.... In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men: but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	12	We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf: that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	13	For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	14	For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	15	And Christ died for all: that they also who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	16	Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh: but now we know him so no longer. We know no man according to the flesh.... That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	17	If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	18	But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	19	For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins. And he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	20	For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	5	21	Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us: that we might be made the justice of God in him. Sin for us.... That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin. 2 Corinthians Chapter 6 He exhorts them to a correspondence with God’s grace and not to associate with unbelievers.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	1	And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	2	For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day of salvation.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	3	Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	4	But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	5	In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	6	In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	7	In the word of truth, in the power of God: by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	8	By honour and dishonour: by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true: as unknown and yet known:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	9	As dying and behold we live: as chastised and not killed:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	10	As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching many: as having nothing and possessing all things.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians: our heart is enlarged.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	12	You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are straitened.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	13	But having the same recompense (I speak as to my children): be you also enlarged.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	14	Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God: as God saith: I will dwell in them and walk among them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	17	Wherefore: Go out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	6	18	And I will receive you. And will be a Father to you: and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians Chapter 7 The apostle’s affection for the Corinthians. His comfort and joy on their account.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	2	Receive us. We have injured no man: we have corrupted no man: we have overreached no man.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	3	I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before that you are in our hearts: to die together and to live together.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	4	Great is my confidence for you: great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	5	For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest: but we suffered all tribulation. Combats without: fears within.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	6	But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	7	And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me: so that I rejoiced the more.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	8	For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent. And if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	9	Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge. In all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	12	Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it: but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	13	Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	14	And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame: but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	15	And his bowels are more abundantly towards you: remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	7	16	I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you. 2 Corinthians Chapter 8 He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of Jerusalem.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	1	Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	2	That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity. Simplicity.... That is, sincere bounty and charity.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	3	For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	4	With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	5	And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God;	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	6	Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	7	That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us: so in this grace also you may abound.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	8	I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	11	Now therefore perform ye it also in deed: that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	12	For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath: not according to that which he hath not.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	13	For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	14	In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an equality,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	15	As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	16	And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	18	We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	19	And not that only: but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	20	Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	21	For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also before men.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much confidence in you,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	23	Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf. 2 Corinthians Chapter 9 A further exhortation to almsgiving. The fruits of it.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	1	For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	2	For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past. And your emulation hath provoked very many.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	3	Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	4	Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	6	Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	7	Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound in you: that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	9	As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	10	And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	11	That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	12	Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	13	By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them and unto all.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	14	And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	9	15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. 2 Corinthians Chapter 10 To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the power of his apostleship.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	1	Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	5	And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	6	And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	7	See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ’s let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we also.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	8	For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	9	But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	10	(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	11	Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	12	For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	13	But we will not glory beyond our measure: but according to the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	15	Not glorying beyond measure in other men’s labours: but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	16	Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel: not to glory in another man’s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	10	18	For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom God commendeth. 2 Corinthians Chapter 11 He is forced to commend himself and his labours, lest the Corinthians should be imposed upon by the false apostles.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	1	Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly! But do bear with me. My folly.... So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	2	For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	3	But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel, which you have not received: you might well bear with him.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	5	For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	6	For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge: but in all things we have been made manifest to you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	7	Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached unto you the Gospel of God freely?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	8	I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	9	And, when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia. And in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you: and so I will keep myself.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	10	The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	11	Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	12	But what I do, that I will do: that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion: that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	13	For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	14	And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	16	I say again (Let no man think me to be foolish: otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little):	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	17	That which I speak, I speak not according to God: but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	18	Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	19	For you gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	20	For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	21	I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	22	They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	23	They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	24	Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes save one.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods: once I was stoned: thrice I suffered shipwreck: a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	26	In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	27	In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	28	Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches. My daily instance.... The labours that come in, and press upon me every day.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	32	At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall: and so escaped his hands. 2 Corinthians Chapter 12 His raptures and revelations, His being buffeted by Satan. His fear for the Corinthians.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	1	If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	2	I know a man in Christ: above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	3	And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	4	That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	5	For such an one I will glory: but for myself I will glory nothing but in my infirmities.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	6	For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	7	And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	8	For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart from me.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	9	And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Power is made perfect.... The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	10	For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	11	I am become foolish. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you. For I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	12	Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	13	For what is there that you have had less than the other churches but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	14	Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	15	But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls: although loving you more, I be loved less.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	16	But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	17	Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	18	I desired Titus: and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not in the same steps?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	19	Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	20	For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	12	21	Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed. 2 Corinthians Chapter 13 He threatens the impenitent, to provoke them to penance.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	1	Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	2	I have told before and foretell, as present and now absent, to them that sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	3	Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	4	For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	5	Try your own selves if you be in the faith: prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	6	But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	7	Now we pray God that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as reprobates. Reprobates.... that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth: but for the truth.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	9	For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	10	Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	11	For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace. And the God of peace and of love shall be with you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	12	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.	24
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS	13	13	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.	24
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the word of life.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	2	For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and hath appeared to us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	3	That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	4	And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy may be full.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	5	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and declare unto you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his word is not in us. 1 John Chapter 2 Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love one another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but abide by the spirit of God in the church.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	1	My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	3	And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. We have known him, if we keep his commandments.... He speaks of that practical knowledge by love and affection, which can only be proved by our keeping his commandments; and without which we can not be said to know God as we should do.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	4	He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar: and the truth is not in him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	5	But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected. And by this we know that we are in him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	7	Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	8	Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both in him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth. A new commandment.... Viz., the commandment of love, which was first given in the old law; but was renewed and extended by Christ. See John 13.34.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no scandal in him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	13	I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	14	I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	15	Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	16	For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	17	And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	18	Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. It is the last hour.... That is, it is the last age of the world. Many Antichrists; ... that is, many heretics, enemies of Christ and his church, and forerunners of the great Antichrist.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	19	They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. They were not of us.... That is, they were not solid, steadfast, genuine Christians: otherwise they would have remained in the church.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	20	But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things. The unction from the Holy One.... That is, grace and wisdom from the Holy Ghost. Know all things.... The true children of God’s church, remaining in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the grace of the Holy Ghost, promised to the church and her pastors; and have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction; so as to have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that society of which they are members.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	21	I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	22	Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	24	As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	25	And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	26	These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	27	And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. You have no need, etc.... You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost; which these new teachers have no share in.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	28	And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	2	29	If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth justice is born of him. 1 John Chapter 3 Of the love of God to us. How we may distinguish the children of God and those of the devil. Of loving one another and of purity of conscience.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	1	Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	2	Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	3	And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is iniquity. Iniquity.... transgression of the law.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	5	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him there is no sin.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath not seen him nor known him. Sinneth not.... viz., mortally. See chap. 1.8.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	9	Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God. Committeth not sin.... That is, as long as he keepeth in himself this seed of grace, and this divine generation, by which he is born of God. But then he may fall from this happy state, by the abuse of his free will, as appears from Rom. 11.20-22; Cor. 9.27; and 10.12; Phil. 2.12; Apoc. 3.11.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	11	For this is the declaration which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother’s just.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	13	Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	16	In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	17	He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	19	In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall persuade our hearts.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	20	For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	21	Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	22	And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	23	And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us. 1 John Chapter 4 What spirits are of God, and what are not. We must love one another, because God has loved us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	1	Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Try the spirits.... Viz., by examining whether their teaching be agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) He that knoweth God, heareth us [the pastors of the church]. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	2	By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: Every spirit which confesseth, etc.... Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient; but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	3	And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world. That dissolveth Jesus.... Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his divinity. He is now already in the world.... Not in his person, but in his spirit, and in his precursors.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	5	They are of the world. Therefore of the world they speak: and the world heareth them.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	6	We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	7	Dearly beloved, let us love one another: for charity is of God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God: for God is charity.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	9	By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	10	In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	11	My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	13	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	16	And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	17	In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	18	Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth is not perfected in charity. Fear is not in charity, etc.... Perfect charity, or love, banisheth human fear, that is, the fear of men; as also all perplexing fear, which makes men mistrust or despair of God’s mercy; and that kind of servile fear, which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of God’s judgments, so often recomended in holy writ; nor that fear and trembling, with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2.12.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	19	Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	20	If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	4	21	And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother. 1 John Chapter 5 Of them that are born of God, and of true charity. Faith overcomes the world. Three that bear witness to Christ. Of faith in his name and of sin that is and is not to death.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. Is born of God.... That is, is justified, and become a child of God by baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere disposition to keep God’s holy law and commandments.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	2	In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	3	For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not heavy.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory which overcometh the world: Our faith. Our faith.... Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a faith that worketh by charity. Gal. 5.6	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ is the truth. Came by water and blood.... Not only to wash away our sins by the water of baptism, but by his own blood.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	7	And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	8	And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three are one. The spirit, and the water, and the blood.... As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ’s divinity; so the spirit, which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his humanity, and are one; that is, all agree in one testimony.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. He that believeth not the Son, etc.... By refusing to believe the testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal life is obtained and promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this lively confidence, that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in the manner we ought. And this we know, and have experience of, by having obtained the petitions that we have made.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	11	And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not life.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	13	These things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life: you who believe in the name of the Son of God.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	14	And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	15	And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	16	He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death. For that I say not that any man ask. A sin which is not to death, etc.... It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin which is not to death, and a sin which is unto death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that is not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is unto death, and adds these words, for that I say not that any man ask, it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any man ask the remission: that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures, that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men’s sins be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault. A sin unto death.... Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	17	All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	19	We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in wickedness. And the whole world is seated in wickedness.... That is, a great part of the world. It may also signify, is under the wicked one, meaning the devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all the wicked. John 12.31.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. And may be in his true Son. He is, or this is the true God, and life eternal.... Which words are a clear proof of Christ’s divinity, and as such made use of by the ancient fathers.	25
THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. Keep yourselves from idols.... An admonition to the newly converted Christians, lest conversing with heathens and idolaters, they might fall back into the sin of idolatry, which may be the sin unto death here mentioned by St. John.	25
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	1	The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth, The ancient.... That is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one of the twelve apostles then living. To the lady Elect.... Some conjecture that Electa might be the name of a family, or of a particular church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this Epistle from St. John.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	2	For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	3	Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	4	I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	6	And this is charity: That we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	7	For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	8	Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	9	Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	10	If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him: God speed you. Nor say to him, God speed you.... This admonition is in general, to forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of every one, even of our enemies.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	11	For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	12	Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that your joy may be full.	26
THE SECOND EPISTLE OF ST. JOHN THE APOSTLE	1	13	The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.	26
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	1	Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	3	Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	5	To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	6	I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	7	Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	9	As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	10	For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	11	For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	12	For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	13	For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	14	And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	15	But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	17	Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	18	Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I tarried with him fifteen days.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	19	But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	20	Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	21	Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	23	But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth now preach the faith which once he impugned.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	1	24	And they glorified God in me. Galatians Chapter 2 The apostle’s preaching was approved of by the other apostles. The Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	1	Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	2	And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles: but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	4	But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	5	To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	6	But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man): for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	7	But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision. The gospel of the uncircumcision.... The preaching of the gospel to the uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles. St. Paul was called in an extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles; St. Peter, besides his general commission over the whole flock, (John 21. 15, etc.,) had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumcision, that is, of the Jews.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	8	(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	9	And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	10	Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	11	But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. I withstood, etc.... The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul’s reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	12	For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	13	And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented: so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	15	We by nature are Jews: and not of the Gentiles, sinners.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	16	But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid!	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	18	For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	19	For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God; with Christ I am nailed to the cross.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	20	And I live, now not I: but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself for me.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	2	21	I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain. Galatians Chapter 3 The Spirit, and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law, but by faith.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	1	O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	2	This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	3	Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	4	Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	5	He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of the faith?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	6	As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	7	Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	9	Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	11	But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	12	But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall live in them.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree).	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	15	Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	16	To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	17	Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	19	Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Because of transgressions.... To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats. Ordained by angels.... The law was delivered by angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the mediator, on this occasion, between God and the people.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	20	Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	21	Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe. Hath concluded all under sin.... that is, hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	23	But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	24	Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be justified by faith. Pedagogue.... That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	25	But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	26	For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. Neither Jew, etc.... That is, no distinction of Jew, etc.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	3	29	And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. Galatians Chapter 4 Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn sons of Abraham.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. Under the elements, etc.... That is, under the first rudiments of religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and sacraments.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	5	That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	6	And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	7	Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	8	But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature, are not gods.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	9	But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to serve again?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	10	You observe days and months and times, and years. You observe days, etc.... He speaks not of the observation of the Lord’s day, or other Christian festivals; but either of the superstitious observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the Jewish festivals, to the observance of which, certain Jewish teachers sought to induce the Galatians.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	12	Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You have not injured me at all.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	13	And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	14	You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	15	Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	16	Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	17	They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	18	But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	19	My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	20	And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	24	Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is Agar.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	25	For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	26	But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	27	For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	29	But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit: so also it is now.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	30	But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. Galatians Chapter 5 He exhorts them to stand to their Christian liberty. Of the fruits of the flesh and of the spirit.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	1	Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	2	Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	3	And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	4	You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	5	For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by Charity.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	7	You did run well. What hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	8	This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	9	A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	12	I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	13	For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty. Only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh: but by charity of the spirit serve one another.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another: take heed you be not consumed one of another.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	16	I say then: Walk in the spirit: and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh: For these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	18	But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	20	Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	21	Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	23	Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	5	26	Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. Galatians Chapter 6 He exhorts to charity, humility and all virtue. He glories in nothing but in the cross of Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	1	Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	2	Bear ye one another’s burdens: and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	3	For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	4	But let every one prove his own work: and so he shall have glory in himself only and not in another.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	5	For every one shall bear his own burden.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	6	And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	7	Be not deceived: God is not mocked.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	8	For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	9	And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	10	Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	11	See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	12	For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law: but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but a new creature.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	16	And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them and mercy: and upon the Israel of God.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	17	From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.	27
THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE GALATIANS	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.	27
