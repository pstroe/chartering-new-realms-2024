Genesis	012	012	It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they
Genesis	012	013	Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me

Genesis	012	015	The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh;
Genesis	012	016	He dealt well with Abram for her sake.  He had sheep,
Genesis	012	017	Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
Genesis	012	018	Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done
Genesis	012	019	Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her
Genesis	012	020	Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him, and they brought him
Genesis	013	001	Abram went up out of Egypt:  he, his wife, all that he had,
Genesis	013	002	Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis	013	003	He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel,
Genesis	013	004	to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first.
Genesis	013	005	Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis	013	006	The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together:
Genesis	013	007	There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock
Genesis	013	008	Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between
Genesis	013	009	Isn't the whole land before you?  Please separate yourself from me.
Genesis	013	010	Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan,
Genesis	013	011	So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself.
Genesis	013	012	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities
Genesis	013	013	Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners
Genesis	013	014	Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now,
Genesis	013	015	for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to
Genesis	013	016	I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that
Genesis	013	017	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
Genesis	013	018	Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre,
Genesis	014	001	It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch,
Genesis	014	002	that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha,
Genesis	014	003	All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same

Genesis	014	007	They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh),
Genesis	014	008	The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king
Genesis	014	009	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis	014	010	Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings
Genesis	014	011	They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food,
Genesis	014	012	They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom,
Genesis	014	013	One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew.
Genesis	014	014	When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth
Genesis	014	015	He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants,
Genesis	014	016	He brought back all the goods, and also brought back
Genesis	014	017	The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from
Genesis	014	018	Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine:
Genesis	014	019	He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High,
Genesis	014	020	and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies
Genesis	014	021	The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people,
Genesis	014	022	Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand
Genesis	014	023	that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything
Genesis	014	024	I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men
Genesis	015	001	After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in
Genesis	015	002	Abram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I
Genesis	015	003	Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed:
Genesis	015	004	Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will
Genesis	015	005	Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky,
Genesis	015	006	He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
Genesis	015	007	He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur
Genesis	015	008	He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
Genesis	015	009	He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female
Genesis	015	010	He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle,
Genesis	015	011	The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram
Genesis	015	012	When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram.
Genesis	015	013	He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as
Genesis	015	014	I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.
Genesis	015	015	but you will go to your fathers in peace.  You will be buried
Genesis	015	016	In the fourth generation they will come here again,
Genesis	015	017	It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it
Genesis	015	018	In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your
Genesis	015	019	the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
Genesis	015	020	the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
Genesis	015	021	the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
Genesis	016	001	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children.  She had a handmaid,
Genesis	016	002	Sarai said to Abram, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing.
Genesis	016	003	Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid,
Genesis	016	004	He went in to Hagar, and she conceived.  When she saw that she
Genesis	016	005	Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault.
Genesis	016	006	But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand.
Genesis	016	007	The angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in
Genesis	016	008	He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from?
Genesis	016	009	The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Return to your mistress,
Genesis	016	010	The angel of Yahweh said to her, "I will greatly multiply
Genesis	016	011	The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Behold, you are with child,
Genesis	016	012	He will be like a wild donkey among men.  His hand will
Genesis	016	013	She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, "You are
Genesis	016	014	Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.{Beer Lahai Roi
Genesis	016	015	Hagar bore a son for Abram.  Abram called the name of his son,
Genesis	016	016	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis	017	001	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram,
Genesis	017	002	I will make my covenant between me and you, and will
Genesis	017	003	Abram fell on his face.  God talked with him, saying,
Genesis	017	004	"As for me, behold, my covenant is with you.  You will be
Genesis	017	005	Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your
Genesis	017	006	I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you.
Genesis	017	007	I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed
Genesis	017	008	I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land
Genesis	017	009	God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant,
Genesis	017	010	This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me
Genesis	017	011	You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin.
Genesis	017	012	He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you,
Genesis	017	013	He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money,
Genesis	017	014	The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh
Genesis	017	015	God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not
Genesis	017	016	I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.
Genesis	017	017	Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
Genesis	017	018	Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
Genesis	017	019	God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son.
Genesis	017	020	As for Ishmael, I have heard you.  Behold, I have blessed him,
Genesis	017	021	But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear
Genesis	017	022	When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
Genesis	017	023	Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house,
Genesis	017	024	Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised
Genesis	017	025	Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised
Genesis	017	026	In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.
Genesis	017	027	All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those
Genesis	018	001	Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat
Genesis	018	002	He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men
Genesis	018	003	and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight,
Genesis	018	004	Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest
Genesis	018	005	I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart.
Genesis	018	006	Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly make
Genesis	018	007	Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf,
Genesis	018	008	He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
Genesis	018	009	They said to him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?
Genesis	018	010	He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season
Genesis	018	011	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age.
Genesis	018	012	Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old
Genesis	018	013	Yahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I
Genesis	018	014	Is anything too hard for Yahweh?  At the set time I will return
Genesis	018	015	Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.
Genesis	018	016	The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom.
Genesis	018	017	Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do,
Genesis	018	018	seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation,
Genesis	018	019	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his
Genesis	018	020	Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
Genesis	018	021	I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad
Genesis	018	022	The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham
Genesis	018	023	Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous
Genesis	018	024	What if there are fifty righteous within the city?
Genesis	018	025	Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous
Genesis	018	026	Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
Genesis	018	027	Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak
Genesis	018	028	What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous?
Genesis	018	029	He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty
Genesis	018	030	He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.
Genesis	018	031	He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.
Genesis	018	032	He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will
Genesis	018	033	Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing
Genesis	019	001	The two angels came to Sodom at evening.  Lot sat in the gate
Genesis	019	002	and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into
Genesis	019	003	He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered
Genesis	019	004	But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom,
Genesis	019	005	They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men
Genesis	019	006	Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
Genesis	019	007	He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.
Genesis	019	008	See now, I have two virgin daughters.  Please let me bring them
Genesis	019	009	They said, "Stand back!"  They said, "This one fellow came
Genesis	019	010	But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house
Genesis	019	011	They struck the men who were at the door of the house
Genesis	019	012	The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here?
Genesis	019	013	for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against
Genesis	019	014	Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were
Genesis	019	015	When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up!
Genesis	019	016	But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand,
Genesis	019	017	It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said,
Genesis	019	018	Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord.
Genesis	019	019	See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you
Genesis	019	020	See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.
Genesis	019	021	He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning
Genesis	019	022	Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there."
Genesis	019	023	The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Genesis	019	024	Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire
Genesis	019	025	He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants
Genesis	019	026	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became
Genesis	019	027	Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had
Genesis	019	028	He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land
Genesis	019	029	It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
Genesis	019	030	Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his
Genesis	019	031	The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old,
Genesis	019	032	Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
Genesis	019	033	They made their father drink wine that night:
Genesis	019	034	It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said
Genesis	019	035	They made their father drink wine that night also.
Genesis	019	036	Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father.
Genesis	019	037	The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.  He is the father
Genesis	019	038	The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.
Genesis	020	001	Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived
Genesis	020	002	Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister."
Genesis	020	003	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said
Genesis	020	004	Now Abimelech had not come near her.  He said, "Lord, will you
Genesis	020	005	Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister?'  She, even she herself,
Genesis	020	006	God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity
Genesis	020	007	Now therefore, restore the man's wife.  For he is a prophet,
Genesis	020	008	Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
Genesis	020	009	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him,
Genesis	020	010	Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have
Genesis	020	011	Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is
Genesis	020	012	Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father,
Genesis	020	013	It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,
Genesis	020	014	Abimelech took sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants,
Genesis	020	015	Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you.
Genesis	020	016	To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand
Genesis	020	017	Abraham prayed to God.  God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
Genesis	020	018	For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house
Genesis	021	001	Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah
Genesis	021	002	Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age,
Genesis	021	003	Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore
Genesis	021	004	Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old,
Genesis	021	005	Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac,
Genesis	021	006	Sarah said, "God has made me laugh.  Everyone who hears will
Genesis	021	007	She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would
Genesis	021	008	The child grew, and was weaned.  Abraham made a great feast
Genesis	021	009	Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne
Genesis	021	010	Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son!
Genesis	021	011	The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account
Genesis	021	012	God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your
Genesis	021	013	I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid,
Genesis	021	014	Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle
Genesis	021	015	The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child
Genesis	021	016	She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow
Genesis	021	017	God heard the voice of the boy.  The angel of God called
Genesis	021	018	Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand.
Genesis	021	019	God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.  She went,
Genesis	021	020	God was with the boy, and he grew.  He lived in the wilderness,
Genesis	021	021	He lived in the wilderness of Paran.  His mother took a wife
Genesis	021	022	It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain
Genesis	021	023	Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal
Genesis	021	024	Abraham said, "I will swear."
Genesis	021	025	Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well,
Genesis	021	026	Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing.
Genesis	021	027	Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech.
Genesis	021	028	Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis	021	029	Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs
Genesis	021	030	He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand,
Genesis	021	031	Therefore he called that place Beersheba,{Beersheba can
Genesis	021	032	So they made a covenant at Beersheba.  Abimelech rose up
Genesis	021	033	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there
Genesis	021	034	Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines
Genesis	022	001	It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham,
Genesis	022	002	He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love,
Genesis	022	003	Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,
Genesis	022	004	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw
Genesis	022	005	Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey.
Genesis	022	006	Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on
Genesis	022	007	Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"
Genesis	022	008	Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering,
Genesis	022	009	They came to the place which God had told him of.
Genesis	022	010	Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
Genesis	022	011	The angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said,
Genesis	022	012	He said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.
Genesis	022	013	Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind
Genesis	022	014	Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide{or,
Genesis	022	015	The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out
Genesis	022	016	and said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you
Genesis	022	017	that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed
Genesis	022	018	In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,
Genesis	022	019	So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went
Genesis	022	020	It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham,
Genesis	022	021	Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
Genesis	022	022	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
Genesis	022	023	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.  These eight Milcah bore
Genesis	022	024	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore
Genesis	023	001	Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.  This was the length
Genesis	023	002	Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land
Genesis	023	003	Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children
Genesis	023	004	"I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you.
Genesis	023	005	The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
Genesis	023	006	"Hear us, my lord.  You are a prince of God among us.
Genesis	023	007	Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
Genesis	023	008	He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should
Genesis	023	009	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has,
Genesis	023	010	Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth.
Genesis	023	011	"No, my lord, hear me.  I give you the field, and I give you
Genesis	023	012	Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
Genesis	023	013	He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of
Genesis	023	014	Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
Genesis	023	015	"My lord, listen to me.  What is a piece of land worth
Genesis	023	016	Abraham listened to Ephron.  Abraham weighed to Ephron
Genesis	023	017	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was
Genesis	023	018	to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
Genesis	023	019	After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave
Genesis	023	020	The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham
Genesis	024	001	Abraham was old, and well stricken in age.  Yahweh had blessed
Genesis	024	002	Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled
Genesis	024	003	I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God
Genesis	024	004	But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take
Genesis	024	005	The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing
Genesis	024	006	Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my
Genesis	024	007	Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house,
Genesis	024	008	If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall
Genesis	024	009	The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
Genesis	024	010	The servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed,
Genesis	024	011	He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well
Genesis	024	012	He said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me
Genesis	024	013	Behold, I am standing by the spring of water.  The daughters
Genesis	024	014	Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say,
Genesis	024	015	It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold,
Genesis	024	016	The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin,
Genesis	024	017	The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink,
Genesis	024	018	She said, "Drink, my lord."  She hurried, and let down her
Genesis	024	019	When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw
Genesis	024	020	She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
Genesis	024	021	The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know
Genesis	024	022	It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
Genesis	024	023	and said, "Whose daughter are you?  Please tell me.

Genesis	024	031	He said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh.  Why do you stand outside?
Genesis	024	032	The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels.
Genesis	024	033	Food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat
Genesis	024	034	He said, "I am Abraham's servant.
Genesis	024	035	Yahweh has blessed my master greatly.  He has become great.
Genesis	024	036	Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old.
Genesis	024	037	My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife
Genesis	024	038	but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives,

Genesis	024	045	Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth
Genesis	024	046	She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
Genesis	024	047	I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?'  She said,
Genesis	024	048	I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh,
Genesis	024	049	Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me.
Genesis	024	050	Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh.
Genesis	024	051	Behold, Rebekah is before you.  Take her, and go, and let
Genesis	024	052	It happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words,
Genesis	024	053	The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
Genesis	024	054	They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him,
Genesis	024	055	Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay
Genesis	024	056	He said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered
Genesis	024	057	They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."
Genesis	024	058	They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"
Genesis	024	059	They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse,
Genesis	024	060	They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you
Genesis	024	061	Rebekah arose with her ladies.  They rode on the camels,
Genesis	024	062	Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived
Genesis	024	063	Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening.
Genesis	024	064	Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,
Genesis	024	065	She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in
Genesis	024	066	The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis	024	067	Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,
Genesis	025	001	Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
Genesis	025	002	She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
Genesis	025	003	Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan.  The sons
Genesis	025	004	The sons of Midian:  Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.
Genesis	025	005	Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,
Genesis	025	006	but to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts.
Genesis	025	007	These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived:
Genesis	025	008	Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age,
Genesis	025	009	Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
Genesis	025	010	the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth.
Genesis	025	011	It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac,
Genesis	025	012	Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,
Genesis	025	013	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
Genesis	025	014	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
Genesis	025	015	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
Genesis	025	016	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names,
Genesis	025	017	These are the years of the life of Ishmael:  one hundred
Genesis	025	018	They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you
Genesis	025	019	This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son.
Genesis	025	020	Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter
Genesis	025	021	Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren.
Genesis	025	022	The children struggled together within her.  She said,
Genesis	025	023	Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb.
Genesis	025	024	When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
Genesis	025	025	The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment.
Genesis	025	026	After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on
Genesis	025	027	The boys grew.  Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field.
Genesis	025	028	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison.
Genesis	025	029	Jacob boiled stew.  Esau came in from the field,
Genesis	025	030	Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew,
Genesis	025	031	Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."
Genesis	025	032	Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die.  What good is the
Genesis	025	033	Jacob said, "Swear to me first."  He swore to him.
Genesis	025	034	Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils.  He ate and drank,
Genesis	026	001	There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine
Genesis	026	002	Yahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt.
Genesis	026	003	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you.
Genesis	026	004	I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will
Genesis	026	005	because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge,
Genesis	026	006	Isaac lived in Gerar.
Genesis	026	007	The men of the place asked him about his wife.  He said,
Genesis	026	008	It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech
Genesis	026	009	Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife.
Genesis	026	010	Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us?
Genesis	026	011	Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this
Genesis	026	012	Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one
Genesis	026	013	The man grew great, and grew more and more until he
Genesis	026	014	He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds,
Genesis	026	015	Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in
Genesis	026	016	Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much
Genesis	026	017	Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar,
Genesis	026	018	Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days
Genesis	026	019	Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well
Genesis	026	020	The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying,
Genesis	026	021	They dug another well, and they argued over that, also.
Genesis	026	022	He left that place, and dug another well.  They didn't
Genesis	026	023	He went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis	026	024	Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am
Genesis	026	025	He built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh,
Genesis	026	026	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend,
Genesis	026	027	Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me,
Genesis	026	028	They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you.
Genesis	026	029	that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you,
Genesis	026	030	He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
Genesis	026	031	They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another.
Genesis	026	032	It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told
Genesis	026	033	He called it Shibah.{Shibah means "oath" or "seven."} Therefore
Genesis	026	034	When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith,
Genesis	026	035	They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
Genesis	027	001	It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
Genesis	027	002	He said, "See now, I am old.  I don't know the day of my death.
Genesis	027	003	Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow,
Genesis	027	004	Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me,
Genesis	027	005	Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.
Genesis	027	006	Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard
Genesis	027	007	'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat,
Genesis	027	008	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which
Genesis	027	009	Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids
Genesis	027	010	You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that
Genesis	027	011	Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother
Genesis	027	012	What if my father touches me?  I will seem to him as a deceiver,
Genesis	027	013	His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son.
Genesis	027	014	He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother.
Genesis	027	015	Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son,
Genesis	027	016	She put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands,
Genesis	027	017	She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,
Genesis	027	018	He came to his father, and said, "My father?"  He said, "Here I am.
Genesis	027	019	Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn.
Genesis	027	020	Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly,
Genesis	027	021	Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you,
Genesis	027	022	Jacob went near to Isaac his father.  He felt him, and said,
Genesis	027	023	He didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy,
Genesis	027	024	He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"  He said, "I am."
Genesis	027	025	He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,
Genesis	027	026	His father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
Genesis	027	027	He came near, and kissed him.  He smelled the smell of his clothing,
Genesis	027	028	God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth,
Genesis	027	029	Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you.
Genesis	027	030	It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob,
Genesis	027	031	He also made savory food, and brought it to his father.
Genesis	027	032	Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"  He said,
Genesis	027	033	Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is he who has
Genesis	027	034	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an
Genesis	027	035	He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken
Genesis	027	036	He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob?  For he has
Genesis	027	037	Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord,
Genesis	027	038	Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father?
Genesis	027	039	Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth
Genesis	027	040	By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.
Genesis	027	041	Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father
Genesis	027	042	The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah.
Genesis	027	043	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice.  Arise, flee to Laban,
Genesis	027	044	Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;
Genesis	027	045	until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what
Genesis	027	046	Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of
Genesis	028	001	Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall
Genesis	028	002	Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your
Genesis	028	003	May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,
Genesis	028	004	and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed
Genesis	028	005	Isaac sent Jacob away.  He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of
Genesis	028	006	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away
Genesis	028	007	and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
Genesis	028	008	Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac,
Genesis	028	009	Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had,
Genesis	028	010	Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
Genesis	028	011	He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night,
Genesis	028	012	He dreamed.  Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and the top
Genesis	028	013	Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, "I am Yahweh,
Genesis	028	014	Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread
Genesis	028	015	Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go,
Genesis	028	016	Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely Yahweh
Genesis	028	017	He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place!
Genesis	028	018	Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
Genesis	028	019	He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city
Genesis	028	020	Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will
Genesis	028	021	so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Yahweh
Genesis	028	022	then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be
Genesis	029	001	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of
Genesis	029	002	He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks
Genesis	029	003	There all the flocks were gathered.  They rolled the stone
Genesis	029	004	Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"
Genesis	029	005	He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"  They said,
Genesis	029	006	He said to them, "Is it well with him?"  They said, "It is well.
Genesis	029	007	He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day,
Genesis	029	008	They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered
Genesis	029	009	While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her
Genesis	029	010	It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban,
Genesis	029	011	Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis	029	012	Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that
Genesis	029	013	It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son,
Genesis	029	014	Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh.
Genesis	029	015	Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you
Genesis	029	016	Laban had two daughters.  The name of the elder was Leah,
Genesis	029	017	Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in
Genesis	029	018	Jacob loved Rachel.  He said, "I will serve you seven years
Genesis	029	019	Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I
Genesis	029	020	Jacob served seven years for Rachel.  They seemed to him
Genesis	029	021	Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled,
Genesis	029	022	Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
Genesis	029	023	It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
Genesis	029	024	Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
Genesis	029	025	It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah.
Genesis	029	026	Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger
Genesis	029	027	Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other
Genesis	029	028	Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week.  He gave him Rachel
Genesis	029	029	Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid,
Genesis	029	030	He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,
Genesis	029	031	Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb,
Genesis	029	032	Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben.
Genesis	029	033	She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has
Genesis	029	034	She conceived again, and bore a son.  Said, "Now this time will my
Genesis	029	035	She conceived again, and bore a son.  She said, "This time
Genesis	030	001	When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied
Genesis	030	002	Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said,
Genesis	030	003	She said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah.  Go in to her, that she
Genesis	030	004	She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went
Genesis	030	005	Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
Genesis	030	006	Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice,
Genesis	030	007	Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob
Genesis	030	008	Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister,
Genesis	030	009	When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah,
Genesis	030	010	Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son.
Genesis	030	011	Leah said, "How fortunate!"  She named him Gad.
Genesis	030	012	Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son.
Genesis	030	013	Leah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy."
Genesis	030	014	Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes
Genesis	030	015	She said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away
Genesis	030	016	Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went
Genesis	030	017	God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob
Genesis	030	018	Leah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid
Genesis	030	019	Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis	030	020	Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry.  Now my
Genesis	030	021	Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
Genesis	030	022	God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.
Genesis	030	023	She conceived, bore a son, and said, "God has taken
Genesis	030	024	She named him Joseph,{Joseph means "may he add."} saying,
Genesis	030	025	It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said
Genesis	030	026	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you,
Genesis	030	027	Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes,
Genesis	030	028	He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
Genesis	030	029	He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your
Genesis	030	030	For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased
Genesis	030	031	He said, "What shall I give you?"  Jacob said, "You shall
Genesis	030	032	I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there
Genesis	030	033	So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter,
Genesis	030	034	Laban said, "Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."
Genesis	030	035	That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted,
Genesis	030	036	He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob,
Genesis	030	037	Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree,
Genesis	030	038	He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the
Genesis	030	039	The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought
Genesis	030	040	Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
Genesis	030	041	It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived,
Genesis	030	042	but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in.
Genesis	030	043	The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks,
Genesis	031	001	He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away
Genesis	031	002	Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was
Genesis	031	003	Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers,
Genesis	031	004	Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,
Genesis	031	005	and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face,
Genesis	031	006	You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.
Genesis	031	007	Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times,
Genesis	031	008	If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all
Genesis	031	009	Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given
Genesis	031	010	It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes,
Genesis	031	011	The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said,
Genesis	031	012	He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats
Genesis	031	013	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you
Genesis	031	014	Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion
Genesis	031	015	Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners?  For he has sold us,
Genesis	031	016	For all the riches which God has taken away from our father,
Genesis	031	017	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,
Genesis	031	018	and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions
Genesis	031	019	Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep:  and Rachel stole
Genesis	031	020	Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him
Genesis	031	021	So he fled with all that he had.  He rose up, passed over the River,
Genesis	031	022	Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
Genesis	031	023	He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him
Genesis	031	024	God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night,
Genesis	031	025	Laban caught up with Jacob.  Now Jacob had pitched his tent
Genesis	031	026	Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me,
Genesis	031	027	Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me,
Genesis	031	028	and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
Genesis	031	029	It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your
Genesis	031	030	Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your
Genesis	031	031	Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said,
Genesis	031	032	Anyone you find your gods with shall not live.
Genesis	031	033	Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into
Genesis	031	034	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's
Genesis	031	035	She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I
Genesis	031	036	Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban.  Jacob answered
Genesis	031	037	Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found
Genesis	031	038	These twenty years I have been with you.  Your ewes and your
Genesis	031	039	That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you.
Genesis	031	040	This was my situation:  in the day the drought consumed me,
Genesis	031	041	These twenty years I have been in your house.  I served you fourteen
Genesis	031	042	Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
Genesis	031	043	Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters,
Genesis	031	044	Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be

Genesis	040	008	They said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there
Genesis	040	009	The chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,

Genesis	040	023	Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.
Genesis	041	001	It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
Genesis	041	002	Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat,
Genesis	041	003	Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river,
Genesis	041	004	The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle.
Genesis	041	005	He slept and dreamed a second time:  and behold, seven heads
Genesis	041	006	Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind,
Genesis	041	007	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears.
Genesis	041	008	It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled,

Genesis	041	014	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily
Genesis	041	015	Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there

Genesis	041	032	The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established
Genesis	041	033	"Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man,

Genesis	041	055	When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh
Genesis	041	056	The famine was over all the surface of the earth.
Genesis	041	057	All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain,
Genesis	042	001	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said
Genesis	042	002	He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.
Genesis	042	003	Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis	042	004	But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers;

Genesis	042	017	He put them all together into custody for three days.
Genesis	042	018	Joseph said to them the third day, "Do this, and live,
Genesis	042	019	If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound
Genesis	042	020	Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified,

Genesis	043	029	He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother,
Genesis	043	030	Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother;
Genesis	043	031	He washed his face, and came out.  He controlled himself,

Genesis	044	005	Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which
Genesis	044	006	He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
Genesis	044	007	They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these?

Genesis	044	032	For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father,
Genesis	044	033	Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy,
Genesis	044	034	For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--
Genesis	045	001	Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood
Genesis	045	002	He wept aloud.  The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis	045	003	Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph!  Does my father

Genesis	045	005	Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold
Genesis	045	006	For these two years the famine has been in the land,

Genesis	045	010	You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near
Genesis	045	011	There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine;

Genesis	045	013	You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt,

Genesis	045	016	The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
Genesis	045	017	Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this.

Genesis	045	027	They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them.
Genesis	045	028	Israel said, "It is enough.  Joseph my son is still alive.
Genesis	046	001	Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba,

Genesis	046	028	He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him
Genesis	046	029	Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel,
Genesis	046	030	Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen
Genesis	046	031	Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house,
Genesis	046	032	These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock,

Genesis	046	034	that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock

Genesis	047	003	Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?"
Genesis	047	004	They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in

Genesis	047	009	Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage
Genesis	047	010	Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis	047	011	Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them
Genesis	047	012	Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his
Genesis	047	013	There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe,
Genesis	047	014	Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt,

Genesis	047	022	Only he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a

Genesis	047	029	The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph,
Genesis	047	030	but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me
Genesis	047	031	He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him.  Israel bowed

Exodus	014	031	Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians,
Exodus	015	001	Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh,
Exodus	015	002	Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
Exodus	015	003	Yahweh is a man of war.  Yahweh is his name.

Exodus	016	012	"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.
Exodus	016	013	It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp;

Exodus	016	016	This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded:
Exodus	016	017	The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
Exodus	016	018	When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much
Exodus	016	019	Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."
Exodus	016	020	Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left
Exodus	016	021	They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according
Exodus	016	022	It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,
Exodus	016	023	He said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken,

Numbers	011	008	The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
Numbers	011	009	When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.
Numbers	011	010	Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families,
Numbers	011	011	Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your servant?
Numbers	011	012	Have I conceived all this people?  Have I brought them forth,
Numbers	011	013	Where should I get meat to give to all this people? for they
Numbers	011	014	I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is
Numbers	011	015	If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have
Numbers	011	016	Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders
Numbers	011	017	I will come down and talk with you there:  and I will take
Numbers	011	018	Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow,
Numbers	011	019	You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days,
Numbers	011	020	but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
Numbers	011	021	Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
Numbers	011	022	Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
Numbers	011	023	Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh's hand grown short? now shall
Numbers	011	024	Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh:
Numbers	011	025	Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of
Numbers	011	026	But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad,
Numbers	011	027	There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad
Numbers	011	028	Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his
Numbers	011	029	Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake?
Numbers	011	030	Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers	011	031	There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails
Numbers	011	032	The people rose up all that day, and all the night,
Numbers	011	033	While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed,
Numbers	011	034	The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there
Numbers	011	035	From Kibrothhattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth;
Numbers	012	001	Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite
Numbers	012	002	They said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses?  Hasn't he
Numbers	012	003	Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were
Numbers	012	004	Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron,
Numbers	012	005	Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of
Numbers	012	006	He said, Hear now my words:  if there be a prophet among you,
Numbers	012	007	My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
Numbers	012	008	with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly,
Numbers	012	009	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers	012	010	The cloud removed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous,
Numbers	012	011	Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please don't lay sin on us,
Numbers	012	012	Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half
Numbers	012	013	Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, God, I beg you.
Numbers	012	014	Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,
Numbers	012	015	Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days:
Numbers	012	016	Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped
Numbers	013	001	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	013	002	Send you men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan,
Numbers	013	003	Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to
Numbers	013	004	These were their names:  Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
Numbers	013	005	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
Numbers	013	006	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers	013	007	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
Numbers	013	008	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
Numbers	013	009	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
Numbers	013	010	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
Numbers	013	011	Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi
Numbers	013	012	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
Numbers	013	013	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
Numbers	013	014	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
Numbers	013	015	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers	013	016	These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land.
Numbers	013	017	Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them,
Numbers	013	018	and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein,
Numbers	013	019	and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad;
Numbers	013	020	and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean,
Numbers	013	021	So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness
Numbers	013	022	They went up by the South, and came to Hebron;
Numbers	013	023	They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there
Numbers	013	024	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster
Numbers	013	025	They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
Numbers	013	026	They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation
Numbers	013	027	They told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us;
Numbers	013	028	However the people who dwell in the land are strong,
Numbers	013	029	Amalek dwells in the land of the South:  and the Hittite,
Numbers	013	030	Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up
Numbers	013	031	But the men who went up with him said, We aren't able to go
Numbers	013	032	They brought up an evil report of the land which they had
Numbers	013	033	There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of
Numbers	014	001	All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
Numbers	014	002	All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:
Numbers	014	003	Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword?
Numbers	014	004	They said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
Numbers	014	005	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
Numbers	014	006	Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
Numbers	014	007	and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
Numbers	014	008	If Yahweh delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
Numbers	014	009	Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people
Numbers	014	010	But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
Numbers	014	011	Yahweh said to Moses, How long will this people despise me?
Numbers	014	012	I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
Numbers	014	013	Moses said to Yahweh, Then the Egyptians will hear it;
Numbers	014	014	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
Numbers	014	015	Now if you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations
Numbers	014	016	Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into
Numbers	014	017	Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you
Numbers	014	018	Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,
Numbers	014	019	Pardon, Please, the iniquity of this people according to
Numbers	014	020	Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to your word:
Numbers	014	021	but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be
Numbers	014	022	because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs,
Numbers	014	023	surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers,
Numbers	014	024	but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
Numbers	014	025	Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley:
Numbers	014	026	Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	014	027	How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur
Numbers	014	028	Tell them, As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken
Numbers	014	029	your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all
Numbers	014	030	surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I
Numbers	014	031	But your little ones, that you said should be a prey,
Numbers	014	032	But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
Numbers	014	033	Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years,
Numbers	014	034	After the number of the days in which you spied out the land,
Numbers	014	035	I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this
Numbers	014	036	The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned,
Numbers	014	037	even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land,
Numbers	014	038	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
Numbers	014	039	Moses told these words to all the children of Israel:
Numbers	014	040	They rose up early in the morning, and got them up
Numbers	014	041	Moses said, Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh,
Numbers	014	042	Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck
Numbers	014	043	For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you,
Numbers	014	044	But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain:
Numbers	014	045	Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived
Numbers	015	001	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	015	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are
Numbers	015	003	and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering,
Numbers	015	004	then shall he who offers his offering offer to Yahweh a meal
Numbers	015	005	and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin,
Numbers	015	006	Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth
Numbers	015	007	and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part
Numbers	015	008	When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice,
Numbers	015	009	then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth
Numbers	015	010	and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine,
Numbers	015	011	Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram,
Numbers	015	012	According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you
Numbers	015	013	All who are native-born shall do these things after this manner,
Numbers	015	014	If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may
Numbers	015	015	For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you,
Numbers	015	016	One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger
Numbers	015	017	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	015	018	Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come
Numbers	015	019	then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land,
Numbers	015	020	Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a
Numbers	015	021	Of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave
Numbers	015	022	When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments,
Numbers	015	023	even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that
Numbers	015	024	then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge
Numbers	015	025	The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation
Numbers	015	026	and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall
Numbers	015	027	If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female
Numbers	015	028	The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs,
Numbers	015	029	You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly,
Numbers	015	030	But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is
Numbers	015	031	Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken
Numbers	015	032	While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
Numbers	015	033	Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses
Numbers	015	034	They put him in custody, because it had not been declared
Numbers	015	035	Yahweh said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death:
Numbers	015	036	All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned
Numbers	015	037	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	015	038	Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they
Numbers	015	039	and it shall be to you for a fringe{or, tassel}, that you may look
Numbers	015	040	that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy
Numbers	015	041	I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
Numbers	016	001	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
Numbers	016	002	and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children
Numbers	016	003	and they assembled themselves together against Moses and
Numbers	016	004	When Moses heard it, he fell on his face:
Numbers	016	005	and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the
Numbers	016	006	This do:  take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
Numbers	016	007	and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow:
Numbers	016	008	Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:
Numbers	016	009	[seems it but] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel
Numbers	016	010	and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons
Numbers	016	011	Therefore you and all your company are gathered together
Numbers	016	012	Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab;
Numbers	016	013	is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land
Numbers	016	014	Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk
Numbers	016	015	Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, "Don't respect
Numbers	016	016	Moses said to Korah, You and all your company go before Yahweh,
Numbers	016	017	and take every man his censer, and put incense on them,
Numbers	016	018	They took every man his censer, and put fire in them,
Numbers	016	019	Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door
Numbers	016	020	Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	016	021	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
Numbers	016	022	They fell on their faces, and said, God, the God of the spirits
Numbers	016	023	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	016	024	Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tent
Numbers	016	025	Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders
Numbers	016	026	He spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
Numbers	016	027	So they got them up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
Numbers	016	028	Moses said, Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do
Numbers	016	029	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they
Numbers	016	030	But if Yahweh make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth,
Numbers	016	031	It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words,
Numbers	016	032	and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up,
Numbers	016	033	So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive
Numbers	016	034	All Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them;
Numbers	016	035	Fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred
Numbers	016	036	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	016	037	Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up
Numbers	016	038	even the censers of these sinners against their own lives;
Numbers	016	039	Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who
Numbers	016	040	to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that
Numbers	016	041	But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel
Numbers	016	042	It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses
Numbers	016	043	Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers	016	044	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	016	045	Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them
Numbers	016	046	Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein
Numbers	016	047	Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly;
Numbers	016	048	He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers	016	049	Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and
Numbers	016	050	Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers	017	001	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	017	002	Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods,
Numbers	017	003	You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there
Numbers	017	004	You shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony,
Numbers	017	005	It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose
Numbers	017	006	Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes
Numbers	017	007	Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers	017	008	It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent
Numbers	017	009	Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all
Numbers	017	010	Yahweh said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony,
Numbers	017	011	Thus did Moses:  as Yahweh commanded him, so did he.
Numbers	017	012	The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish,
Numbers	017	013	Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tent of Yahweh, dies:
Numbers	018	001	Yahweh said to Aaron, You and your sons and your fathers'
Numbers	018	002	Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,
Numbers	018	003	They shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent:
Numbers	018	004	They shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of
Numbers	018	005	You shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
Numbers	018	006	I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among
Numbers	018	007	You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for
Numbers	018	008	Yahweh spoke to Aaron, I, behold, I have given you the charge
Numbers	018	009	This shall be your of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire:
Numbers	018	010	As the most holy things shall you eat of it; every male shall
Numbers	018	011	This is your:  the wave offering of their gift, even all
Numbers	018	012	All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage,
Numbers	018	013	The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they
Numbers	018	014	Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers	018	015	Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they
Numbers	018	016	Those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall
Numbers	018	017	But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep,
Numbers	018	018	The flesh of them shall be your, as the wave offering breast
Numbers	018	019	All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children
Numbers	018	020	Yahweh said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land,
Numbers	018	021	To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe
Numbers	018	022	Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent
Numbers	018	023	But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting,
Numbers	018	024	For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave
Numbers	018	025	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	018	026	Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them,
Numbers	018	027	Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it
Numbers	018	028	Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all
Numbers	018	029	Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering
Numbers	018	030	Therefore you shall tell them, When you heave the best of it
Numbers	018	031	You shall eat it in every place, you and your households:
Numbers	018	032	You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved
Numbers	019	001	Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Numbers	019	002	This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded,
Numbers	019	003	You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring
Numbers	019	004	and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
Numbers	019	005	One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,
Numbers	019	006	and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
Numbers	019	007	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe
Numbers	019	008	He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
Numbers	019	009	A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
Numbers	019	010	He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
Numbers	019	011	He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
Numbers	019	012	the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day,
Numbers	019	013	Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died,
Numbers	019	014	This is the law when a man dies in a tent:  everyone who comes
Numbers	019	015	Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.
Numbers	019	016	Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword,
Numbers	019	017	For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning
Numbers	019	018	and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
Numbers	019	019	and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day,
Numbers	019	020	But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
Numbers	019	021	It shall be a perpetual statute to them:  and he who sprinkles
Numbers	019	022	Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;
Numbers	020	001	The children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
Numbers	020	002	There was no water for the congregation:  and they assembled
Numbers	020	003	The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we
Numbers	020	004	Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness,
Numbers	020	005	Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us
Numbers	020	006	Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to
Numbers	020	007	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	020	008	Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron
Numbers	020	009	Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.
Numbers	020	010	Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock,
Numbers	020	011	Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice:
Numbers	020	012	Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, Because you didn't believe
Numbers	020	013	These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel
Numbers	020	014	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says
Numbers	020	015	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in
Numbers	020	016	and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent
Numbers	020	017	Please let us pass through your land:  we will not pass
Numbers	020	018	Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come
Numbers	020	019	The children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway;
Numbers	020	020	He said, You shall not pass through.  Edom came out against him
Numbers	020	021	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
Numbers	020	022	They traveled from Kadesh:  and the children of Israel,
Numbers	020	023	Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border
Numbers	020	024	Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter
Numbers	020	025	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
Numbers	020	026	and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son:
Numbers	020	027	Moses did as Yahweh commanded:  and they went up into Mount Hor
Numbers	020	028	Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar
Numbers	020	029	When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept
Numbers	021	001	The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South,
Numbers	021	002	Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
Numbers	021	003	Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
Numbers	021	004	They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea
Numbers	021	005	The people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you
Numbers	021	006	Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people;
Numbers	021	007	The people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,

Numbers	030	016	These are the statutes, which Yahweh commanded Moses,
Numbers	031	001	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	031	002	Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites:
Numbers	031	003	Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm you men from among you
Numbers	031	004	Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
Numbers	031	005	So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel,
Numbers	031	006	Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war,
Numbers	031	007	They warred against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses;
Numbers	031	008	They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain:
Numbers	031	009	The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their
Numbers	031	010	All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all
Numbers	031	011	They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man
Numbers	031	012	They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
Numbers	031	013	Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of
Numbers	031	014	Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains
Numbers	031	015	Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?
Numbers	031	016	Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
Numbers	031	017	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
Numbers	031	018	But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him,
Numbers	031	019	Encamp you outside of the camp seven days:  whoever has
Numbers	031	020	As to every garment, and all that is made of skin,
Numbers	031	021	Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle,
Numbers	031	022	however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
Numbers	031	023	everything that may abide the fire, you shall make to go
Numbers	031	024	You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall
Numbers	031	025	Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers	031	026	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal,
Numbers	031	027	and divide the prey into two parts:  between the men skilled
Numbers	031	028	Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle:
Numbers	031	029	take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest,
Numbers	031	030	Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out
Numbers	031	031	Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
Numbers	031	032	Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took,
Numbers	031	033	and seventy-two thousand oxen,
Numbers	031	034	and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
Numbers	031	035	and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had
Numbers	031	036	The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war,
Numbers	031	037	and Yahweh's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
Numbers	031	038	The oxen were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh's
Numbers	031	039	The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh's
Numbers	031	040	The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute
Numbers	031	041	Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's wave offering,
Numbers	031	042	Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off
Numbers	031	043	(now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven
Numbers	031	044	and thirty-six thousand oxen,
Numbers	031	045	and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
Numbers	031	046	and sixteen thousand persons),
Numbers	031	047	even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn
Numbers	031	048	The officers who were over the thousands of the army,
Numbers	031	049	and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum
Numbers	031	050	We have brought Yahweh's offering, what every man has gotten,
Numbers	031	051	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,
Numbers	031	052	All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh,
Numbers	031	053	([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
Numbers	031	054	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
Numbers	032	001	Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had
Numbers	032	002	the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke
Numbers	032	003	Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon,
Numbers	032	004	the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel,
Numbers	032	005	They said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land
Numbers	032	006	Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children
Numbers	032	007	Why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from
Numbers	032	008	Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea
Numbers	032	009	For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
Numbers	032	010	Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,
Numbers	032	011	Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
Numbers	032	012	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua
Numbers	032	013	Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
Numbers	032	014	Behold, you are risen up in your fathers' place, an increase
Numbers	032	015	For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
Numbers	032	016	They came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
Numbers	032	017	but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children
Numbers	032	018	We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel
Numbers	032	019	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan,
Numbers	032	020	Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm
Numbers	032	021	and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,
Numbers	032	022	and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you
Numbers	032	023	But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh;
Numbers	032	024	Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
Numbers	032	025	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses,
Numbers	032	026	Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock,
Numbers	032	027	but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war,
Numbers	032	028	So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest,
Numbers	032	029	Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children
Numbers	032	030	but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall
Numbers	032	031	The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,
Numbers	032	032	We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,
Numbers	032	033	Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children
Numbers	032	034	The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
Numbers	032	035	and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,

Numbers	035	018	Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand,
Numbers	035	019	The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death:

Numbers	035	021	or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died;
Numbers	035	022	But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him
Numbers	035	023	or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him,
Numbers	035	024	then the congregation shall judge between the striker and

Numbers	036	008	Every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe
Numbers	036	009	So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;
Numbers	036	010	Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:

Deuteronomy	001	002	It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir
Deuteronomy	001	003	It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,
Deuteronomy	001	004	after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites,
Deuteronomy	001	005	Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
Deuteronomy	001	006	Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived
Deuteronomy	001	007	turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of
Deuteronomy	001	008	Behold, I have set the land before you:  go in and possess the land
Deuteronomy	001	009	I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
Deuteronomy	001	010	Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this
Deuteronomy	001	011	Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times
Deuteronomy	001	012	How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden,
Deuteronomy	001	013	Take wise men of understanding and well known according
Deuteronomy	001	014	You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken
Deuteronomy	001	015	So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known,
Deuteronomy	001	016	I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes]
Deuteronomy	001	017	You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small
Deuteronomy	001	018	I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
Deuteronomy	001	019	We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and
Deuteronomy	001	020	I said to you, You are come to the hill country of the Amorites,
Deuteronomy	001	021	Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you:
Deuteronomy	001	022	You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send
Deuteronomy	001	023	The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you,
Deuteronomy	001	024	and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came
Deuteronomy	001	025	They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
Deuteronomy	001	026	Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment
Deuteronomy	001	027	and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh
Deuteronomy	001	028	Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart
Deuteronomy	001	029	Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy	001	030	Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you,
Deuteronomy	001	031	and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh
Deuteronomy	001	032	Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	001	033	who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch
Deuteronomy	001	034	Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry,
Deuteronomy	001	035	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation
Deuteronomy	001	036	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh:  he shall see it; and to him
Deuteronomy	001	037	Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also
Deuteronomy	001	038	Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there:
Deuteronomy	001	039	Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey,
Deuteronomy	001	040	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness
Deuteronomy	001	041	Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh,
Deuteronomy	001	042	Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight;
Deuteronomy	001	043	So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled
Deuteronomy	001	044	The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you,
Deuteronomy	001	045	You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen
Deuteronomy	001	046	So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days
Deuteronomy	002	001	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
Deuteronomy	002	002	Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
Deuteronomy	002	003	You have compassed this mountain long enough:
Deuteronomy	002	004	Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through
Deuteronomy	002	005	don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land,
Deuteronomy	002	006	You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat;
Deuteronomy	002	007	For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand;
Deuteronomy	002	008	So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell
Deuteronomy	002	009	Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them
Deuteronomy	002	010	(The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many,
Deuteronomy	002	011	these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites
Deuteronomy	002	012	The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau
Deuteronomy	002	013	Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.  We went over
Deuteronomy	002	014	The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we
Deuteronomy	002	015	Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them
Deuteronomy	002	016	So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
Deuteronomy	002	017	that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
Deuteronomy	002	018	You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
Deuteronomy	002	019	and when you come near over against the children of Ammon,
Deuteronomy	002	020	(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:  Rephaim lived
Deuteronomy	002	021	a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim;
Deuteronomy	002	022	as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,
Deuteronomy	002	023	and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza,
Deuteronomy	002	024	Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon:
Deuteronomy	002	025	This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear
Deuteronomy	002	026	I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon
Deuteronomy	002	027	Let me pass through your land:  I will go along by the highway,
Deuteronomy	002	028	You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me
Deuteronomy	002	029	as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
Deuteronomy	002	030	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him;
Deuteronomy	002	031	Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon
Deuteronomy	002	032	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people,
Deuteronomy	002	033	Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him,
Deuteronomy	002	034	We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
Deuteronomy	002	035	only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves,
Deuteronomy	002	036	From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
Deuteronomy	002	037	only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near;
Deuteronomy	003	001	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan:  and Og the king
Deuteronomy	003	002	Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him,
Deuteronomy	003	003	So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king
Deuteronomy	003	004	We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we
Deuteronomy	003	005	All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars;
Deuteronomy	003	006	We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon,
Deuteronomy	003	007	But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took
Deuteronomy	003	008	We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings
Deuteronomy	003	009	([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites
Deuteronomy	003	010	all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
Deuteronomy	003	011	(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of
Deuteronomy	003	012	This land we took in possession at that time:  from Aroer,
Deuteronomy	003	013	and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og,
Deuteronomy	003	014	Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob,
Deuteronomy	003	015	I gave Gilead to Machir.
Deuteronomy	003	016	To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead
Deuteronomy	003	017	the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it],
Deuteronomy	003	018	I commanded you at that time, saying, Yahweh your God has given
Deuteronomy	003	019	But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock,
Deuteronomy	003	020	until Yahweh give rest to your brothers, as to you, and they
Deuteronomy	003	021	I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen
Deuteronomy	003	022	You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who
Deuteronomy	003	023	I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy	003	024	Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness,
Deuteronomy	003	025	Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond
Deuteronomy	003	026	But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't
Deuteronomy	003	027	Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward,
Deuteronomy	003	028	But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him;
Deuteronomy	003	029	So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy	004	001	Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I
Deuteronomy	004	002	You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall
Deuteronomy	004	003	Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor;
Deuteronomy	004	004	But you who did cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone
Deuteronomy	004	005	Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh
Deuteronomy	004	006	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
Deuteronomy	004	007	For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them,
Deuteronomy	004	008	What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances
Deuteronomy	004	009	Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently,
Deuteronomy	004	010	the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb,
Deuteronomy	004	011	You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
Deuteronomy	004	012	Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire:
Deuteronomy	004	013	He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you
Deuteronomy	004	014	Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
Deuteronomy	004	015	Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner
Deuteronomy	004	016	Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image
Deuteronomy	004	017	the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness
Deuteronomy	004	018	the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness
Deuteronomy	004	019	and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see
Deuteronomy	004	020	But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
Deuteronomy	004	021	Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes,
Deuteronomy	004	022	but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan;
Deuteronomy	004	023	Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh
Deuteronomy	004	024	For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
Deuteronomy	004	025	When you shall father children, and children's children, and you
Deuteronomy	004	026	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
Deuteronomy	004	027	Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall
Deuteronomy	004	028	There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,
Deuteronomy	004	029	But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall
Deuteronomy	004	030	When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you,
Deuteronomy	004	031	for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you,
Deuteronomy	004	032	For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you,
Deuteronomy	004	033	Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst
Deuteronomy	004	034	Or has God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst
Deuteronomy	004	035	To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God;
Deuteronomy	004	036	Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might
Deuteronomy	004	037	Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their
Deuteronomy	004	038	to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you,
Deuteronomy	004	039	Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh
Deuteronomy	004	040	You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I
Deuteronomy	004	041	Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan
Deuteronomy	004	042	that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares,
Deuteronomy	004	043	[namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country,
Deuteronomy	004	044	This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
Deuteronomy	004	045	these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
Deuteronomy	004	046	beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor,
Deuteronomy	004	047	They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king
Deuteronomy	004	048	from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
Deuteronomy	004	049	and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea
Deuteronomy	005	001	Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel,
Deuteronomy	005	002	Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy	005	003	Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
Deuteronomy	005	004	Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of
Deuteronomy	005	005	(I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you
Deuteronomy	005	006	"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
Deuteronomy	005	007	You shall have no other gods before me.
Deuteronomy	005	008	"You shall not make an engraved image for yourself,
Deuteronomy	005	009	you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them;
Deuteronomy	005	010	and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
Deuteronomy	005	011	"You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain:
Deuteronomy	005	012	"Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your
Deuteronomy	005	013	Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
Deuteronomy	005	014	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God:
Deuteronomy	005	015	You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt,
Deuteronomy	005	016	"Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;
Deuteronomy	005	017	"You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy	005	018	"Neither shall you commit adultery.
Deuteronomy	005	019	"Neither shall you steal.
Deuteronomy	005	020	"Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy	005	021	"Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you
Deuteronomy	005	022	These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain
Deuteronomy	005	023	It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst
Deuteronomy	005	024	and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory
Deuteronomy	005	025	Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
Deuteronomy	005	026	For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice
Deuteronomy	005	027	Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say:
Deuteronomy	005	028	Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me;
Deuteronomy	005	029	Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me,
Deuteronomy	005	030	Go tell them, Return you to your tents.
Deuteronomy	005	031	But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you
Deuteronomy	005	032	You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has
Deuteronomy	005	033	You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has
Deuteronomy	006	001	Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances,
Deuteronomy	006	002	that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes
Deuteronomy	006	003	Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it
Deuteronomy	006	004	Hear, Israel:  Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:
Deuteronomy	006	005	and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
Deuteronomy	006	006	These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
Deuteronomy	006	007	and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
Deuteronomy	006	008	You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall
Deuteronomy	006	009	You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
Deuteronomy	006	010	It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
Deuteronomy	006	011	and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill,
Deuteronomy	006	012	then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth
Deuteronomy	006	013	You shall fear Yahweh your God; and him shall you serve,
Deuteronomy	006	014	You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples
Deuteronomy	006	015	for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God;
Deuteronomy	006	016	You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
Deuteronomy	006	017	You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	006	018	You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh;
Deuteronomy	006	019	to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
Deuteronomy	006	020	When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean
Deuteronomy	006	021	then you shall tell your son, We were Pharaoh's bondservants
Deuteronomy	006	022	and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt,
Deuteronomy	006	023	and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in,
Deuteronomy	006	024	Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh
Deuteronomy	006	025	It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this
Deuteronomy	007	001	When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you
Deuteronomy	007	002	and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you,
Deuteronomy	007	003	neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you
Deuteronomy	007	004	For he will turn away your son from following me, that they
Deuteronomy	007	005	But thus shall you deal with them:  you shall break down their altars,
Deuteronomy	007	006	For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God:  Yahweh your
Deuteronomy	007	007	Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you
Deuteronomy	007	008	but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath
Deuteronomy	007	009	Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God,
Deuteronomy	007	010	and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them:
Deuteronomy	007	011	You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,
Deuteronomy	007	012	It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances,
Deuteronomy	007	013	and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you;
Deuteronomy	007	014	You shall be blessed above all peoples:  there shall not be
Deuteronomy	007	015	Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil
Deuteronomy	007	016	You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	007	017	If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I;
Deuteronomy	007	018	you shall not be afraid of them:  you shall well remember
Deuteronomy	007	019	the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs,
Deuteronomy	007	020	Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them,
Deuteronomy	007	021	You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in
Deuteronomy	007	022	Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you
Deuteronomy	007	023	But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will
Deuteronomy	007	024	He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you
Deuteronomy	007	025	The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire:
Deuteronomy	007	026	You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become
Deuteronomy	008	001	All the commandment which I command you this day shall you
Deuteronomy	008	002	You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you
Deuteronomy	008	003	He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna,
Deuteronomy	008	004	Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell,
Deuteronomy	008	005	You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son,
Deuteronomy	008	006	You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk
Deuteronomy	008	007	For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land
Deuteronomy	008	008	a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;
Deuteronomy	008	009	a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness,
Deuteronomy	008	010	You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	008	011	Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping
Deuteronomy	008	012	lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built
Deuteronomy	008	013	and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver
Deuteronomy	008	014	then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	008	015	who led you through the great and terrible wilderness,
Deuteronomy	008	016	who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers
Deuteronomy	008	017	and [lest] you say in your heart, My power and the might of my
Deuteronomy	008	018	But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives
Deuteronomy	008	019	It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk
Deuteronomy	008	020	As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you,
Deuteronomy	009	001	Hear, Israel:  you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go
Deuteronomy	009	002	a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know,
Deuteronomy	009	003	Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes
Deuteronomy	009	004	Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	009	005	Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart,
Deuteronomy	009	006	Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this
Deuteronomy	009	007	Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	009	008	Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry
Deuteronomy	009	009	When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone,
Deuteronomy	009	010	Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written
Deuteronomy	009	011	It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
Deuteronomy	009	012	Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence;
Deuteronomy	009	013	Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people,
Deuteronomy	009	014	let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
Deuteronomy	009	015	So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain
Deuteronomy	009	016	I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God;
Deuteronomy	009	017	I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
Deuteronomy	009	018	I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days
Deuteronomy	009	019	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,
Deuteronomy	009	020	Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him:
Deuteronomy	009	021	I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it
Deuteronomy	009	022	At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah,
Deuteronomy	009	023	When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess
Deuteronomy	009	024	You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that
Deuteronomy	009	025	So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights
Deuteronomy	009	026	I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your
Deuteronomy	009	027	Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look
Deuteronomy	009	028	lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was
Deuteronomy	009	029	Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought
Deuteronomy	010	001	At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone
Deuteronomy	010	002	I will write on the tables the words that were on the first
Deuteronomy	010	003	So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables
Deuteronomy	010	004	He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
Deuteronomy	010	005	I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables
Deuteronomy	010	006	(The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.
Deuteronomy	010	007	From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
Deuteronomy	010	008	At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear
Deuteronomy	010	009	Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers;
Deuteronomy	010	010	I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days
Deuteronomy	010	011	Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people;
Deuteronomy	010	012	Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you,
Deuteronomy	010	013	to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I
Deuteronomy	010	014	Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven
Deuteronomy	010	015	Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them,
Deuteronomy	010	016	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be
Deuteronomy	010	017	For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords,
Deuteronomy	010	018	He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow,
Deuteronomy	010	019	Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in
Deuteronomy	010	020	You shall fear Yahweh your God; him shall you serve;
Deuteronomy	010	021	He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you
Deuteronomy	010	022	Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons;
Deuteronomy	011	001	Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge,
Deuteronomy	011	002	Know you this day:  for I don't speak with your children
Deuteronomy	011	003	and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt
Deuteronomy	011	004	and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to
Deuteronomy	011	005	and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came
Deuteronomy	011	006	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
Deuteronomy	011	007	but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.
Deuteronomy	011	008	Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command
Deuteronomy	011	009	and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh
Deuteronomy	011	010	For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land
Deuteronomy	011	011	but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills
Deuteronomy	011	012	a land which Yahweh your God cares for:  the eyes of Yahweh
Deuteronomy	011	013	It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments
Deuteronomy	011	014	that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former
Deuteronomy	011	015	I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you
Deuteronomy	011	016	Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you
Deuteronomy	011	017	and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut
Deuteronomy	011	018	Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in
Deuteronomy	011	019	You shall teach them your children, talking of them,
Deuteronomy	011	020	You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
Deuteronomy	011	021	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
Deuteronomy	011	022	For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I
Deuteronomy	011	023	then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you
Deuteronomy	011	024	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall
Deuteronomy	011	025	There shall no man be able to stand before you:
Deuteronomy	011	026	Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
Deuteronomy	011	027	the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh
Deuteronomy	011	028	and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments
Deuteronomy	011	029	It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
Deuteronomy	011	030	Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going
Deuteronomy	011	031	For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land
Deuteronomy	011	032	You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances
Deuteronomy	012	001	These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe
Deuteronomy	012	002	You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that
Deuteronomy	012	003	and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces
Deuteronomy	012	004	You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.
Deuteronomy	012	005	But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all
Deuteronomy	012	006	and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
Deuteronomy	012	007	and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall
Deuteronomy	012	008	You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
Deuteronomy	012	009	for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
Deuteronomy	012	010	But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which
Deuteronomy	012	011	then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	012	012	You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons,
Deuteronomy	012	013	Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings
Deuteronomy	012	014	but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes,
Deuteronomy	012	015	Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all
Deuteronomy	012	016	Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on
Deuteronomy	012	017	You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,
Deuteronomy	012	018	but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place
Deuteronomy	012	019	Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long
Deuteronomy	012	020	When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as he has
Deuteronomy	012	021	If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put
Deuteronomy	012	022	Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it:
Deuteronomy	012	023	Only be sure that you don't eat the blood:  for the blood
Deuteronomy	012	024	You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
Deuteronomy	012	025	You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with
Deuteronomy	012	026	Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take,
Deuteronomy	012	027	and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
Deuteronomy	012	028	Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it
Deuteronomy	012	029	When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you,
Deuteronomy	012	030	take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them,
Deuteronomy	012	031	You shall not do so to Yahweh your God:  for every abomination
Deuteronomy	012	032	Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do:
Deuteronomy	013	001	If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer
Deuteronomy	013	002	and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke
Deuteronomy	013	003	you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to
Deuteronomy	013	004	You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep
Deuteronomy	013	005	That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death,
Deuteronomy	013	006	If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,
Deuteronomy	013	007	of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you,
Deuteronomy	013	008	you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall
Deuteronomy	013	009	but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him
Deuteronomy	013	010	You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has
Deuteronomy	013	011	All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more
Deuteronomy	013	012	If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities,
Deuteronomy	013	013	Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you,
Deuteronomy	013	014	then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
Deuteronomy	013	015	you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge
Deuteronomy	013	016	You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst
Deuteronomy	013	017	There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand;
Deuteronomy	013	018	when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	014	001	You are the children of Yahweh your God:  you shall not
Deuteronomy	014	002	For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh
Deuteronomy	014	003	You shall not eat any abominable thing.
Deuteronomy	014	004	These are the animals which you may eat:  the ox, the sheep,
Deuteronomy	014	005	the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat,
Deuteronomy	014	006	Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,
Deuteronomy	014	007	Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud,

Deuteronomy	028	007	Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be
Deuteronomy	028	008	Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns,

Deuteronomy	028	011	Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body,
Deuteronomy	028	012	Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky,
Deuteronomy	028	013	Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail;
Deuteronomy	028	014	and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I
Deuteronomy	028	015	But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice
Deuteronomy	028	016	Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be
Deuteronomy	028	017	Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
Deuteronomy	028	018	Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,

Deuteronomy	028	021	Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until he has
Deuteronomy	028	022	Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever,
Deuteronomy	028	023	Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth
Deuteronomy	028	024	Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust:
Deuteronomy	028	025	Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies;
Deuteronomy	028	026	Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky,
Deuteronomy	028	027	Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors,
Deuteronomy	028	028	Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness,
Deuteronomy	028	029	and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes
Deuteronomy	028	030	You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
Deuteronomy	028	031	Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall
Deuteronomy	028	032	Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;
Deuteronomy	028	033	The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation
Deuteronomy	028	034	so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which
Deuteronomy	028	035	Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,
Deuteronomy	028	036	Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,
Deuteronomy	028	037	You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
Deuteronomy	028	038	You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather
Deuteronomy	028	039	You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall
Deuteronomy	028	040	You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,
Deuteronomy	028	041	You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;
Deuteronomy	028	042	All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
Deuteronomy	028	043	The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above
Deuteronomy	028	044	He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:
Deuteronomy	028	045	All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,
Deuteronomy	028	046	and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,
Deuteronomy	028	047	Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,
Deuteronomy	028	048	therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send
Deuteronomy	028	049	Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end
Deuteronomy	028	050	a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard
Deuteronomy	028	051	and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of
Deuteronomy	028	052	They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high
Deuteronomy	028	053	You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons
Deuteronomy	028	054	The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall
Deuteronomy	028	055	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
Deuteronomy	028	056	The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure
Deuteronomy	028	057	and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,
Deuteronomy	028	058	If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that
Deuteronomy	028	059	then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues
Deuteronomy	028	060	He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,
Deuteronomy	028	061	Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written
Deuteronomy	028	062	You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars
Deuteronomy	028	063	It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,
Deuteronomy	028	064	Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one
Deuteronomy	028	065	Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there
Deuteronomy	028	066	and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall
Deuteronomy	028	067	In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even
Deuteronomy	028	068	Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way
Deuteronomy	029	001	These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded
Deuteronomy	029	002	Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen
Deuteronomy	029	003	the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs,
Deuteronomy	029	004	but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see,
Deuteronomy	029	005	I have led you forty years in the wilderness:  your clothes
Deuteronomy	029	006	You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink;
Deuteronomy	029	007	When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
Deuteronomy	029	008	and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance
Deuteronomy	029	009	Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them,
Deuteronomy	029	010	You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God;
Deuteronomy	029	011	your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is
Deuteronomy	029	012	that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	029	013	that he may establish you this day to himself for a people,
Deuteronomy	029	014	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
Deuteronomy	029	015	but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh
Deuteronomy	029	016	(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came
Deuteronomy	029	017	and you have seen their abominations, and their idols,
Deuteronomy	029	018	lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family,
Deuteronomy	029	019	and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse,
Deuteronomy	029	020	Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh
Deuteronomy	029	021	Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel,
Deuteronomy	029	022	The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you,
Deuteronomy	029	023	[and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning,
Deuteronomy	029	024	even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus
Deuteronomy	029	025	Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh,
Deuteronomy	029	026	and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that
Deuteronomy	029	027	therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land,
Deuteronomy	029	028	and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,
Deuteronomy	029	029	The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things
Deuteronomy	030	001	It shall happen, when all these things are come on you,
Deuteronomy	030	002	and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice
Deuteronomy	030	003	that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have
Deuteronomy	030	004	If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of
Deuteronomy	030	005	and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your
Deuteronomy	030	006	Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart
Deuteronomy	030	007	Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies,
Deuteronomy	030	008	You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his
Deuteronomy	030	009	Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work
Deuteronomy	030	010	if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his
Deuteronomy	030	011	For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not
Deuteronomy	030	012	It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up
Deuteronomy	030	013	Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go
Deuteronomy	030	014	But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,
Deuteronomy	030	015	Behold, I have set before you this day life and good,
Deuteronomy	030	016	in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God,
Deuteronomy	030	017	But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall
Deuteronomy	030	018	I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish;
Deuteronomy	030	019	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I
Deuteronomy	030	020	to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him;
Deuteronomy	031	001	Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
Deuteronomy	031	002	He said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day;
Deuteronomy	031	003	Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy
Deuteronomy	031	004	Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings
Deuteronomy	031	005	Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them
Deuteronomy	031	006	Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared
Deuteronomy	031	007	Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of
Deuteronomy	031	008	Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you,
Deuteronomy	031	009	Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons
Deuteronomy	031	010	Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years,
Deuteronomy	031	011	when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God
Deuteronomy	031	012	Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,
Deuteronomy	031	013	and that their children, who have not known, may hear,
Deuteronomy	031	014	Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:
Deuteronomy	031	015	Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:
Deuteronomy	031	016	Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;
Deuteronomy	031	017	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
Deuteronomy	031	018	I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they
Deuteronomy	031	019	Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it
Deuteronomy	031	020	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
Deuteronomy	031	021	It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
Deuteronomy	031	022	So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it
Deuteronomy	031	023	He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,
Deuteronomy	031	024	It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
Deuteronomy	031	025	that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant
Deuteronomy	031	026	Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark
Deuteronomy	031	027	For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I
Deuteronomy	031	028	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
Deuteronomy	031	029	For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,
Deuteronomy	031	030	Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words
Deuteronomy	032	001	Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear
Deuteronomy	032	002	My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall
Deuteronomy	032	003	For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness
Deuteronomy	032	004	The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:
Deuteronomy	032	005	They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not
Deuteronomy	032	006	Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?
Deuteronomy	032	007	Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.
Deuteronomy	032	008	When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
Deuteronomy	032	009	For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot
Deuteronomy	032	010	He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.
Deuteronomy	032	011	As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,
Deuteronomy	032	012	Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.
Deuteronomy	032	013	He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
Deuteronomy	032	014	Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of
Deuteronomy	032	015	But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.
Deuteronomy	032	016	They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked
Deuteronomy	032	017	They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods
Deuteronomy	032	018	Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
Deuteronomy	032	019	Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation
Deuteronomy	032	020	He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their
Deuteronomy	032	021	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
Deuteronomy	032	022	For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest
Deuteronomy	032	023	I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.
Deuteronomy	032	024	[They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning
Deuteronomy	032	025	Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both
Deuteronomy	032	026	I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory
Deuteronomy	032	027	were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
Deuteronomy	032	028	For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no
Deuteronomy	032	029	Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
Deuteronomy	032	030	How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
Deuteronomy	032	031	For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
Deuteronomy	032	032	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
Deuteronomy	032	033	Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
Deuteronomy	032	034	Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
Deuteronomy	032	035	Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their
Deuteronomy	032	036	For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
Deuteronomy	032	037	He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which
Deuteronomy	032	038	Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine
Deuteronomy	032	039	See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.
Deuteronomy	032	040	For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
Deuteronomy	032	041	if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;
Deuteronomy	032	042	I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall
Deuteronomy	032	043	Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge
Deuteronomy	032	044	Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears
Deuteronomy	032	045	Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
Deuteronomy	032	046	He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I
Deuteronomy	032	047	For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,
Deuteronomy	032	048	Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
Deuteronomy	032	049	Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,
Deuteronomy	032	050	and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered
Deuteronomy	032	051	because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
Deuteronomy	032	052	For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go
Deuteronomy	033	001	This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed
Deuteronomy	033	002	He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.
Deuteronomy	033	003	Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.
Deuteronomy	033	004	Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
Deuteronomy	033	005	He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,
Deuteronomy	033	006	Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
Deuteronomy	033	007	This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,
Deuteronomy	033	008	Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your
Deuteronomy	033	009	who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
Deuteronomy	033	010	They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.
Deuteronomy	033	011	Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.
Deuteronomy	033	012	Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell
Deuteronomy	033	013	Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the
Deuteronomy	033	014	for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious
Deuteronomy	033	015	for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious
Deuteronomy	033	016	for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
Deuteronomy	033	017	The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are
Deuteronomy	033	018	Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
Deuteronomy	033	019	They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will
Deuteronomy	033	020	Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
Deuteronomy	033	021	He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's
Deuteronomy	033	022	Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
Deuteronomy	033	023	Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of
Deuteronomy	033	024	Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.
Deuteronomy	033	025	Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall
Deuteronomy	033	026	There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens
Deuteronomy	033	027	The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are
Deuteronomy	033	028	Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land
Deuteronomy	033	029	You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
Deuteronomy	034	001	Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
Deuteronomy	034	002	and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
Deuteronomy	034	003	and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city
Deuteronomy	034	004	Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,
Deuteronomy	034	005	So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,
Deuteronomy	034	006	He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
Deuteronomy	034	007	Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:
Deuteronomy	034	008	The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
Deuteronomy	034	009	Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
Deuteronomy	034	010	There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,
Deuteronomy	034	011	in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do
Deuteronomy	034	012	and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,
Joshua	001	001	Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
Joshua	001	002	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
Joshua	001	003	I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will
Joshua	001	004	From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,
Joshua	001	005	No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
Joshua	001	006	Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this
Joshua	001	007	Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according
Joshua	001	008	This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,
Joshua	001	009	Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.
Joshua	001	010	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua	001	011	"Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,
Joshua	001	012	Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to
Joshua	001	013	"Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh
Joshua	001	014	Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live
Joshua	001	015	until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,
Joshua	001	016	They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us
Joshua	001	017	Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.
Joshua	001	018	Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your
Joshua	002	001	Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim
Joshua	002	002	The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children
Joshua	002	003	The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men
Joshua	002	004	The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,
Joshua	002	005	It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it
Joshua	002	006	But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with
Joshua	002	007	The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:
Joshua	002	008	Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
Joshua	002	009	and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given
Joshua	002	010	For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the
Joshua	002	011	As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did
Joshua	002	012	Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt
Joshua	002	013	and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,
Joshua	002	014	The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk
Joshua	002	015	Then she let them down by a cord through the window;
Joshua	002	016	She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;
Joshua	002	017	The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath
Joshua	002	018	Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line
Joshua	002	019	It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into
Joshua	002	020	But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
Joshua	002	021	She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,
Joshua	002	022	They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,
Joshua	002	023	Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,
Joshua	002	024	They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands
Joshua	003	001	Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,
Joshua	003	002	It happened after three days, that the officers went through
Joshua	003	003	and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark
Joshua	003	004	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
Joshua	003	005	Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow
Joshua	003	006	Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark
Joshua	003	007	Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you
Joshua	003	008	You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,
Joshua	003	009	Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear
Joshua	003	010	Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is
Joshua	003	011	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
Joshua	003	012	Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
Joshua	003	013	It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests
Joshua	003	014	It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass
Joshua	003	015	and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
Joshua	003	016	that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose
Joshua	003	017	The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
Joshua	004	001	It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over
Joshua	004	002	"Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Joshua	004	003	and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of
Joshua	004	004	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
Joshua	004	005	Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your
Joshua	004	006	that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
Joshua	004	007	then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan
Joshua	004	008	The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
Joshua	004	009	Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
Joshua	004	010	For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,
Joshua	004	011	It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,
Joshua	004	012	The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe
Joshua	004	013	About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed
Joshua	004	014	On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
Joshua	004	015	Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
Joshua	004	016	"Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,
Joshua	004	017	Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out
Joshua	004	018	It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
Joshua	004	019	The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
Joshua	004	020	Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of
Joshua	004	021	He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your
Joshua	004	022	Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came
Joshua	004	023	For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from
Joshua	004	024	that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,
Joshua	005	001	It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
Joshua	005	002	At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,
Joshua	005	003	Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children
Joshua	005	004	This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came
Joshua	005	005	For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all
Joshua	005	006	For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
Joshua	005	007	Their children, whom he raised up in their place,
Joshua	005	008	It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,
Joshua	005	009	Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach
Joshua	005	010	The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept
Joshua	005	011	They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce
Joshua	005	012	The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce
Joshua	005	013	It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
Joshua	005	014	He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."
Joshua	005	015	The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes
Joshua	006	001	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.
Joshua	006	002	Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,
Joshua	006	003	All your men of war shall march around the city, going around
Joshua	006	004	Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
Joshua	006	005	It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,
Joshua	006	006	Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,
Joshua	006	007	They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,
Joshua	006	008	It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,
Joshua	006	009	The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,
Joshua	006	010	Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,
Joshua	006	011	So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,
Joshua	006	012	Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
Joshua	006	013	The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
Joshua	006	014	The second day they marched around the city once, and returned
Joshua	006	015	It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning
Joshua	006	016	It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
Joshua	006	017	The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.
Joshua	006	018	But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,
Joshua	006	019	But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
Joshua	006	020	So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
Joshua	006	021	They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
Joshua	006	022	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,
Joshua	006	023	The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab
Joshua	006	024	They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
Joshua	006	025	But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all
Joshua	006	026	Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be
Joshua	006	027	So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua	007	001	But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;
Joshua	007	002	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,
Joshua	007	003	They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all
Joshua	007	004	So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:
Joshua	007	005	The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they
Joshua	007	006	Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before
Joshua	007	007	Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought
Joshua	007	008	Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned
Joshua	007	009	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will
Joshua	007	010	Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen
Joshua	007	011	Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my
Joshua	007	012	Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;
Joshua	007	013	Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
Joshua	007	014	In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:
Joshua	007	015	It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall
Joshua	007	016	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
Joshua	007	017	and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family
Joshua	007	018	and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,
Joshua	007	019	Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,
Joshua	007	020	Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned
Joshua	007	021	when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,
Joshua	007	022	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,
Joshua	007	023	They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them
Joshua	007	024	Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
Joshua	007	025	Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall
Joshua	007	026	They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;
Joshua	008	001	Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:
Joshua	008	002	You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:
Joshua	008	003	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:
Joshua	008	004	He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against
Joshua	008	005	and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
Joshua	008	006	and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them
Joshua	008	007	and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of
Joshua	008	008	It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set
Joshua	008	009	Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,
Joshua	008	010	Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,
Joshua	008	011	All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,
Joshua	008	012	He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
Joshua	008	013	So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north
Joshua	008	014	It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried
Joshua	008	015	Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
Joshua	008	016	All the people who were in the city were called together
Joshua	008	017	There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't
Joshua	008	018	Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in
Joshua	008	019	The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
Joshua	008	020	When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,
Joshua	008	021	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
Joshua	008	022	The others came forth out of the city against them;
Joshua	008	023	The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua	008	024	It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the
Joshua	008	025	All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,
Joshua	008	026	For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched
Joshua	008	027	Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took
Joshua	008	028	So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,
Joshua	008	029	The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:
Joshua	008	030	Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
Joshua	008	031	as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,
Joshua	008	032	He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
Joshua	008	033	All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,
Joshua	008	034	Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing
Joshua	008	035	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
Joshua	009	001	It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
Joshua	009	002	that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
Joshua	009	003	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
Joshua	009	004	they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they
Joshua	009	005	and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;
Joshua	009	006	They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,
Joshua	009	007	The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;
Joshua	009	008	They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,
Joshua	009	009	They said to him, From a very far country your servants
Joshua	009	010	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
Joshua	009	011	Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke
Joshua	009	012	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
Joshua	009	013	and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,
Joshua	009	014	The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at
Joshua	009	015	Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
Joshua	009	016	It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant
Joshua	009	017	The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on
Joshua	009	018	The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes
Joshua	009	019	But all the princes said to all the congregation,
Joshua	009	020	This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,
Joshua	009	021	The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became
Joshua	009	022	Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,
Joshua	009	023	Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be
Joshua	009	024	They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
Joshua	009	025	Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right
Joshua	009	026	So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of
Joshua	009	027	That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water
Joshua	010	001	Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua
Joshua	010	002	that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
Joshua	010	003	Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,
Joshua	010	004	Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it
Joshua	010	005	Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
Joshua	010	006	The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
Joshua	010	007	So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
Joshua	010	008	Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered
Joshua	010	009	Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up
Joshua	010	010	Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them
Joshua	010	011	It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they
Joshua	010	012	Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh
Joshua	010	013	The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation
Joshua	010	014	There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
Joshua	010	015	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua	010	016	These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua	010	017	It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,
Joshua	010	018	Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,
Joshua	010	019	but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost
Joshua	010	020	It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
Joshua	010	021	that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
Joshua	010	022	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth
Joshua	010	023	They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out
Joshua	010	024	It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,
Joshua	010	025	Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;
Joshua	010	026	Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged
Joshua	010	027	It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,
Joshua	010	028	Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge
Joshua	010	029	Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,
Joshua	010	030	and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand
Joshua	010	031	Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,
Joshua	010	032	and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;
Joshua	010	033	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
Joshua	010	034	Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;
Joshua	010	035	and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge
Joshua	010	036	Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;
Joshua	010	037	and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
Joshua	010	038	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,
Joshua	010	039	and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;
Joshua	010	040	So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,
Joshua	010	041	Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all
Joshua	010	042	All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
Joshua	010	043	Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua	011	001	It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent
Joshua	011	002	and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,
Joshua	011	003	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,
Joshua	011	004	They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,
Joshua	011	005	All these kings met together; and they came and encamped
Joshua	011	006	Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;
Joshua	011	007	So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
Joshua	011	008	Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
Joshua	011	009	Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,
Joshua	011	010	Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
Joshua	011	011	They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,
Joshua	011	012	All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
Joshua	011	013	But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
Joshua	011	014	All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children
Joshua	011	015	As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:
Joshua	011	016	So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,
Joshua	011	017	from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad
Joshua	011	018	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua	011	019	There was not a city that made peace with the children
Joshua	011	020	For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
Joshua	011	021	Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
Joshua	011	022	There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
Joshua	011	023	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
Joshua	012	001	Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
Joshua	012	002	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
Joshua	012	003	and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
Joshua	012	004	and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
Joshua	012	005	and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
Joshua	012	006	Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
Joshua	012	007	These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
Joshua	012	008	in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
Joshua	012	009	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Joshua	012	010	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua	012	011	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua	012	012	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua	012	013	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua	012	014	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua	012	015	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua	012	016	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Joshua	012	017	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua	012	018	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
Joshua	012	019	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua	012	020	the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua	012	021	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua	012	022	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua	012	023	the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
Joshua	012	024	the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
Joshua	013	001	Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
Joshua	013	002	This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
Joshua	013	003	from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
Joshua	013	004	on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
Joshua	013	005	and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
Joshua	013	006	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
Joshua	013	007	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
Joshua	013	008	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
Joshua	013	009	from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
Joshua	013	010	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
Joshua	013	011	and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
Joshua	013	012	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
Joshua	013	013	Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
Joshua	013	014	Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
Joshua	013	015	Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
Joshua	013	016	Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
Joshua	013	017	Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
Joshua	013	018	and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Joshua	013	019	and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
Joshua	013	020	and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
Joshua	013	021	and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
Joshua	013	022	Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
Joshua	013	023	The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
Joshua	013	024	Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
Joshua	013	025	Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
Joshua	013	026	and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
Joshua	013	027	and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
Joshua	013	028	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
Joshua	013	029	Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
Joshua	013	030	Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
Joshua	013	031	and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
Joshua	013	032	These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
Joshua	013	033	But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
Joshua	014	001	These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
Joshua	014	002	by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
Joshua	014	003	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
Joshua	014	004	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
Joshua	014	005	As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
Joshua	014	006	Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
Joshua	014	007	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
Joshua	014	008	Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
Joshua	014	009	Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
Joshua	014	010	Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
Joshua	014	011	As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
Joshua	014	012	Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
Joshua	014	013	Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
Joshua	014	014	Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
Joshua	014	015	Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
Joshua	015	001	The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
Joshua	015	002	Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
Joshua	015	003	and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
Joshua	015	004	and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook
Joshua	015	005	The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.
Joshua	015	006	and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by
Joshua	015	007	and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,
Joshua	015	008	and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom
Joshua	015	009	and the border extended from the top of the mountain
Joshua	015	010	and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
Joshua	015	011	and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
Joshua	015	012	The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].
Joshua	015	013	To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children
Joshua	015	014	Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,
Joshua	015	015	He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:
Joshua	015	016	Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
Joshua	015	017	Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
Joshua	015	018	It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask
Joshua	015	019	She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me
Joshua	015	020	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
Joshua	015	021	The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
Joshua	015	022	and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
Joshua	015	023	and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
Joshua	015	024	Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
Joshua	015	025	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth, Hezron (the same is Hazor),
Joshua	015	026	Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
Joshua	015	027	and Hazar Gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth Pelet,
Joshua	015	028	and Hazar Shual, and Beersheba, and Biziothiah,
Joshua	015	029	Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
Joshua	015	030	and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
Joshua	015	031	and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
Joshua	015	032	and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon:  all the cities
Joshua	015	033	In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
Joshua	015	034	and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
Joshua	015	035	Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

Joshua	019	051	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
Joshua	020	001	Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

Joshua	021	041	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession
Joshua	021	042	These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
Joshua	021	043	So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give
Joshua	021	044	Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore
Joshua	021	045	There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had
Joshua	022	001	Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
Joshua	022	002	and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant
Joshua	022	003	you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,
Joshua	022	004	Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke
Joshua	022	005	Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses
Joshua	022	006	So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went
Joshua	022	007	Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
Joshua	022	008	and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,
Joshua	022	009	The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe
Joshua	022	010	When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land
Joshua	022	011	The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
Joshua	022	012	When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
Joshua	022	013	The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
Joshua	022	014	and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for
Joshua	022	015	They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
Joshua	022	016	Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass
Joshua	022	017	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
Joshua	022	018	that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it
Joshua	022	019	However, if the land of your possession be unclean,
Joshua	022	020	Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,
Joshua	022	021	Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
Joshua	022	022	The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;
Joshua	022	023	that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;
Joshua	022	024	and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,
Joshua	022	025	for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,
Joshua	022	026	Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
Joshua	022	027	but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our
Joshua	022	028	Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us
Joshua	022	029	Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,
Joshua	022	030	When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,
Joshua	022	031	Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children
Joshua	022	032	Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
Joshua	022	033	The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
Joshua	022	034	The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
Joshua	023	001	It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest
Joshua	023	002	that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for
Joshua	023	003	and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all
Joshua	023	004	Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,
Joshua	023	005	Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,
Joshua	023	006	Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is
Joshua	023	007	that you not come among these nations, these that remain
Joshua	023	008	but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.
Joshua	023	009	For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:
Joshua	023	010	One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,
Joshua	023	011	Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love
Joshua	023	012	Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant
Joshua	023	013	know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive
Joshua	023	014	Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
Joshua	023	015	It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you
Joshua	023	016	When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,
Joshua	024	001	Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,
Joshua	024	002	Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God
Joshua	024	003	I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
Joshua	024	004	I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,
Joshua	024	005	I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
Joshua	024	006	I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;
Joshua	024	007	When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between
Joshua	024	008	I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond
Joshua	024	009	Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought
Joshua	024	010	but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
Joshua	024	011	You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men
Joshua	024	012	I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,
Joshua	024	013	I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities
Joshua	024	014	Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;
Joshua	024	015	If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom
Joshua	024	016	The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,
Joshua	024	017	for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers
Joshua	024	018	and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites
Joshua	024	019	Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;
Joshua	024	020	If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will
Joshua	024	021	The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.
Joshua	024	022	Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against
Joshua	024	023	Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are
Joshua	024	024	The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,
Joshua	024	025	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
Joshua	024	026	Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;
Joshua	024	027	Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
Joshua	024	028	So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
Joshua	024	029	It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
Joshua	024	030	They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,
Joshua	024	031	Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days
Joshua	024	032	The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
Joshua	024	033	Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill
Judges	001	001	It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel
Judges	001	002	Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:  behold, I have delivered
Judges	001	003	Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
Judges	001	004	Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the

Judges	001	016	The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up

Judges	001	027	Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and
Judges	001	028	It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put
Judges	001	029	Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;
Judges	001	030	Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the

Judges	002	001	The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
Judges	002	002	and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land;

Judges	002	005	They called the name of that place Bochim:  and they sacrificed
Judges	002	006	Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel
Judges	002	007	The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all
Judges	002	008	Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one
Judges	002	009	They buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Judges	002	010	Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers:
Judges	002	011	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	002	012	and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought
Judges	002	013	They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges	002	014	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
Judges	002	015	Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them
Judges	002	016	Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand
Judges	002	017	Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the
Judges	002	018	When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge,
Judges	002	019	But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back,
Judges	002	020	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said,
Judges	002	021	I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them
Judges	002	022	that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
Judges	002	023	So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily;
Judges	003	001	Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel
Judges	003	002	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
Judges	003	003	[namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
Judges	003	004	They were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
Judges	003	005	The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,
Judges	003	006	and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
Judges	003	007	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	003	008	Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
Judges	003	009	When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
Judges	003	010	The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel;
Judges	003	011	The land had rest forty years.  Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges	003	012	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	003	013	He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek;
Judges	003	014	The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges	003	015	But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised
Judges	003	016	Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length;
Judges	003	017	He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab:  now Eglon was
Judges	003	018	When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away
Judges	003	019	But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal,
Judges	003	020	Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool
Judges	003	021	Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his
Judges	003	022	and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
Judges	003	023	Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors
Judges	003	024	Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw,
Judges	003	025	They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open
Judges	003	026	Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries,
Judges	003	027	It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in
Judges	003	028	He said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your
Judges	003	029	They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,
Judges	003	030	So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.
Judges	003	031	After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck
Judges	004	001	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	004	002	Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
Judges	004	003	The children of Israel cried to Yahweh:  for he had nine hundred
Judges	004	004	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged
Judges	004	005	She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
Judges	004	006	She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Judges	004	007	I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain
Judges	004	008	Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go;
Judges	004	009	She said, I will surely go with you:  notwithstanding, the journey
Judges	004	010	Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh;
Judges	004	011	Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites,
Judges	004	012	They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
Judges	004	013	Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
Judges	004	014	Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has
Judges	004	015	Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army,
Judges	004	016	But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army,
Judges	004	017	However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael
Judges	004	018	Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord,
Judges	004	019	He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink;
Judges	004	020	He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be,
Judges	004	021	Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer
Judges	004	022	Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
Judges	004	023	So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
Judges	004	024	The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more
Judges	005	001	Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
Judges	005	002	Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people
Judges	005	003	Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, [even] I,
Judges	005	004	Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out
Judges	005	005	The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai,
Judges	005	006	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
Judges	005	007	The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
Judges	005	008	They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there
Judges	005	009	My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered
Judges	005	010	Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit
Judges	005	011	Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing
Judges	005	012	Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!
Judges	005	013	Then a remnant of the nobles [and] the people came down.
Judges	005	014	Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you,
Judges	005	015	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar,
Judges	005	016	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling
Judges	005	017	Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?
Judges	005	018	Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths;
Judges	005	019	The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at
Judges	005	020	From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses,
Judges	005	021	The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river,
Judges	005	022	Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,
Judges	005	023	Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh.  Curse bitterly
Judges	005	024	Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite;
Judges	005	025	He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter
Judges	005	026	She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to
Judges	005	027	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed,
Judges	005	028	Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera's mother
Judges	005	029	Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,
Judges	005	030	Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?  A lady,
Judges	005	031	So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love
Judges	006	001	The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	006	002	The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of
Judges	006	003	So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
Judges	006	004	and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase
Judges	006	005	For they came up with their livestock and their tents;
Judges	006	006	Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children
Judges	006	007	It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh
Judges	006	008	that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel:
Judges	006	009	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
Judges	006	010	and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not
Judges	006	011	The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which
Judges	006	012	The angel of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him,
Judges	006	013	Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then
Judges	006	014	Yahweh looked at him, and said, Go in this your might,
Judges	006	015	He said to him, Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold,
Judges	006	016	Yahweh said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall
Judges	006	017	He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight,
Judges	006	018	Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out
Judges	006	019	Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
Judges	006	020	The angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
Judges	006	021	Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was
Judges	006	022	Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said,
Judges	006	023	Yahweh said to him, Peace be to you; don't be afraid:
Judges	006	024	Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it
Judges	006	025	It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him,
Judges	006	026	and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold,
Judges	006	027	Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh
Judges	006	028	When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
Judges	006	029	They said one to another, Who has done this thing?
Judges	006	030	Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son,
Judges	006	031	Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend
Judges	006	032	Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
Judges	006	033	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
Judges	006	034	But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet;
Judges	006	035	He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were
Judges	006	036	Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand,
Judges	006	037	behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor;
Judges	006	038	It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed
Judges	006	039	Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me,
Judges	006	040	God did so that night:  for it was dry on the fleece only,
Judges	007	001	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,
Judges	007	002	Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are
Judges	007	003	Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is
Judges	007	004	Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them
Judges	007	005	So he brought down the people to the water:  and Yahweh said
Judges	007	006	The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,
Judges	007	007	Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped
Judges	007	008	So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets;
Judges	007	009	It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you
Judges	007	010	But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant
Judges	007	011	and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall
Judges	007	012	The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
Judges	007	013	When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream
Judges	007	014	His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword
Judges	007	015	It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,
Judges	007	016	He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
Judges	007	017	He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise:  and behold,
Judges	007	018	When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow
Judges	007	019	So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him,
Judges	007	020	The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers,
Judges	007	021	They stood every man in his place round about the camp;
Judges	007	022	They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every
Judges	007	023	The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out
Judges	007	024	Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country
Judges	007	025	They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb;
Judges	008	001	The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you
Judges	008	002	He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you?
Judges	008	003	God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb
Judges	008	004	Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three
Judges	008	005	He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread
Judges	008	006	The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
Judges	008	007	Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna
Judges	008	008	He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner;
Judges	008	009	He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
Judges	008	010	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them,
Judges	008	011	Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents
Judges	008	012	Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them;
Judges	008	013	Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from
Judges	008	014	He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him:
Judges	008	015	He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna,
Judges	008	016	He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness
Judges	008	017	He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
Judges	008	018	Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
Judges	008	019	He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother:
Judges	008	020	He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them.
Judges	008	021	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us;
Judges	008	022	Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us,
Judges	008	023	Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall
Judges	008	024	Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you,
Judges	008	025	They answered, We will willingly give them.  They spread a garment,
Judges	008	026	The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand
Judges	008	027	Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:
Judges	008	028	So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they
Judges	008	029	Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
Judges	008	030	Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body;
Judges	008	031	His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son,
Judges	008	032	Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
Judges	008	033	It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
Judges	008	034	The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God,
Judges	008	035	neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
Judges	009	001	Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his
Judges	009	002	Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
Judges	009	003	His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men
Judges	009	004	They gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of
Judges	009	005	He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers
Judges	009	006	All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together,
Judges	009	007	When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top
Judges	009	008	The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them;
Judges	009	009	But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness,
Judges	009	010	The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
Judges	009	011	But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness,
Judges	009	012	The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
Judges	009	013	The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers
Judges	009	014	Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you,
Judges	009	015	The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me
Judges	009	016	Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously,
Judges	009	017	(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life,
Judges	009	018	and you are risen up against my father's house this day,
Judges	009	019	if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal
Judges	009	020	but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour
Judges	009	021	Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there,
Judges	009	022	Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
Judges	009	023	God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;
Judges	009	024	that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come,
Judges	009	025	The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains,
Judges	009	026	Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over
Judges	009	027	They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards,
Judges	009	028	Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
Judges	009	029	Would that this people were under my hand! then would I
Judges	009	030	When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
Judges	009	031	He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the
Judges	009	032	Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you,
Judges	009	033	and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up,
Judges	009	034	Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night,
Judges	009	035	Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of
Judges	009	036	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
Judges	009	037	Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down
Judges	009	038	Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said,
Judges	009	039	Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
Judges	009	040	Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell
Judges	009	041	Abimelech lived at Arumah:  and Zebul drove out Gaal and
Judges	009	042	It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field;
Judges	009	043	He took the people, and divided them into three companies,
Judges	009	044	Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward,
Judges	009	045	Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
Judges	009	046	When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it,
Judges	009	047	It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem
Judges	009	048	Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people
Judges	009	049	All the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
Judges	009	050	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
Judges	009	051	But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled
Judges	009	052	Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew
Judges	009	053	A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head,
Judges	009	054	Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer,
Judges	009	055	When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed
Judges	009	056	Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
Judges	009	057	and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite
Judges	010	001	After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah,
Judges	010	002	He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was
Judges	010	003	After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged
Judges	010	004	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they
Judges	010	005	Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
Judges	010	006	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight
Judges	010	007	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold
Judges	010	008	They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year:
Judges	010	009	The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also
Judges	010	010	The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have
Judges	010	011	Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from
Judges	010	012	The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
Judges	010	013	Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods:
Judges	010	014	Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save
Judges	010	015	The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned:
Judges	010	016	They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh;
Judges	010	017	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
Judges	010	018	The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another,
Judges	011	001	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor,
Judges	011	002	Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up,
Judges	011	003	Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob:
Judges	011	004	It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made
Judges	011	005	It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
Judges	011	006	and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we
Judges	011	007	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me,
Judges	011	008	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we
Judges	011	009	Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home
Judges	011	010	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness
Judges	011	011	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
Judges	011	012	Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
Judges	011	013	The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers
Judges	011	014	Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;
Judges	011	015	and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah:  Israel didn't take
Judges	011	016	but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went
Judges	011	017	then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let
Judges	011	018	Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land
Judges	011	019	Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
Judges	011	020	But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border;
Judges	011	021	Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his
Judges	011	022	They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon
Judges	011	023	So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites
Judges	011	024	Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
Judges	011	025	Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor,
Judges	011	026	While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer
Judges	011	027	I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong
Judges	011	028	However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen
Judges	011	029	Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed
Judges	011	030	Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed
Judges	011	031	then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors
Judges	011	032	So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight
Judges	011	033	He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty
Judges	011	034	Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter
Judges	011	035	It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes,
Judges	011	036	She said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh;
Judges	011	037	She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me:
Judges	011	038	He said, Go.  He sent her away for two months:
Judges	011	039	It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father,
Judges	011	040	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter
Judges	012	001	The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward;
Judges	012	002	Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife
Judges	012	003	When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand,
Judges	012	004	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead,
Judges	012	005	The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.
Judges	012	006	then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth;
Judges	012	007	Jephthah judged Israel six years.  Then died Jephthah the Gileadite,
Judges	012	008	After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
Judges	012	009	He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad,
Judges	012	010	Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
Judges	012	011	After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged

Judges	013	001	The children of Israel again did that which was evil in
Judges	013	002	There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
Judges	013	003	The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and said to her,
Judges	013	004	Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink,
Judges	013	005	for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
Judges	013	006	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
Judges	013	007	but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son;
Judges	013	008	Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, Oh, Lord, please let
Judges	013	009	God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
Judges	013	010	The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said
Judges	013	011	Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
Judges	013	012	Manoah said, Now let your words happen:  what shall be the ordering
Judges	013	013	The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said
Judges	013	014	She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let
Judges	013	015	Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you,
Judges	013	016	The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me,
Judges	013	017	Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name,
Judges	013	018	The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why do you ask after my name,
Judges	013	019	So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered
Judges	013	020	For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky
Judges	013	021	But the angel of Yahweh did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife.
Judges	013	022	Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we
Judges	013	023	But his wife said to him, If Yahweh were pleased to kill us,
Judges	013	024	The woman bore a son, and named him Samson:  and the child grew,
Judges	013	025	The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan,
Judges	014	001	Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of
Judges	014	002	He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
Judges	014	003	Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there
Judges	014	004	But his father and his mother didn't know that it was of Yahweh;
Judges	014	005	Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother,
Judges	014	006	The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him
Judges	014	007	He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
Judges	014	008	After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside
Judges	014	009	He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went;
Judges	014	010	His father went down to the woman:  and Samson made there a feast;
Judges	014	011	It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
Judges	014	012	Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you:
Judges	014	013	but if you can't declare it to me, then shall you give me
Judges	014	014	He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food.
Judges	014	015	It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife,
Judges	014	016	Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me,
Judges	014	017	She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
Judges	014	018	The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun
Judges	014	019	The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down
Judges	014	020	But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had
Judges	015	001	But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest,
Judges	015	002	Her father said, I most certainly thought that you had
Judges	015	003	Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard
Judges	015	004	Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
Judges	015	005	When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
Judges	015	006	Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?  They said, Samson,
Judges	015	007	Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I
Judges	015	008	He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter:
Judges	015	009	Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread
Judges	015	010	The men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?
Judges	015	011	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock
Judges	015	012	They said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we
Judges	015	013	They spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast,
Judges	015	014	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him:
Judges	015	015	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand,
Judges	015	016	Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps,
Judges	015	017	It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast
Judges	015	018	He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have
Judges	015	019	But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out
Judges	015	020	He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges	016	001	Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went
Judges	016	002	[It was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here.
Judges	016	003	Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid
Judges	016	004	It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley
Judges	016	005	The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her,
Judges	016	006	Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, Please, in which your great
Judges	016	007	Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords
Judges	016	008	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
Judges	016	009	Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber.
Judges	016	010	Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies:
Judges	016	011	He said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with
Judges	016	012	So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith,
Judges	016	013	Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me,
Judges	016	014	She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines
Judges	016	015	She said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart
Judges	016	016	It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words,
Judges	016	017	He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever
Judges	016	018	When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,
Judges	016	019	She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man,
Judges	016	020	She said, The Philistines are on you, Samson.  He awoke out
Judges	016	021	The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they
Judges	016	022	However the hair of his head began to grow again after
Judges	016	023	The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer
Judges	016	024	When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said,
Judges	016	025	It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
Judges	016	026	and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, Allow me
Judges	016	027	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
Judges	016	028	Samson called to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, remember me,
Judges	016	029	Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the
Judges	016	030	Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.
Judges	016	031	Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down,
Judges	017	001	There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges	017	002	He said to his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver
Judges	017	003	He restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother;
Judges	017	004	When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took
Judges	017	005	The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,
Judges	017	006	In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
Judges	017	007	There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family
Judges	017	008	The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah,
Judges	017	009	Micah said to him, Whence come you?  He said to him, I am
Judges	017	010	Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father
Judges	017	011	The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
Judges	017	012	Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest,
Judges	017	013	Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good,
Judges	018	001	In those days there was no king in Israel:  and in those days
Judges	018	002	The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
Judges	018	003	When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice
Judges	018	004	He said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me,
Judges	018	005	They said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we
Judges	018	006	The priest said to them, Go in peace:  before Yahweh is your
Judges	018	007	Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw
Judges	018	008	They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol:
Judges	018	009	They said, Arise, and let us go up against them;
Judges	018	010	When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land
Judges	018	011	There set forth from there of the family of the Danites,
Judges	018	012	They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah:
Judges	018	013	They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came
Judges	018	014	Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered,
Judges	018	015	They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young
Judges	018	016	The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were
Judges	018	017	The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came
Judges	018	018	When these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image,
Judges	018	019	They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth,
Judges	018	020	The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim,
Judges	018	021	So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and
Judges	018	022	When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who
Judges	018	023	They cried to the children of Dan.  They turned their faces,
Judges	018	024	He said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest,
Judges	018	025	The children of Dan said to him, "Don't let your voice be heard
Judges	018	026	The children of Dan went their way:  and when Micah saw
Judges	018	027	They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom
Judges	018	028	There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon,
Judges	018	029	They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
Judges	018	030	The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image:
Judges	018	031	So they set them up Micah's engraved image which he made,
Judges	019	001	It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
Judges	019	002	His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went
Judges	019	003	Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her,
Judges	019	004	His father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him;
Judges	019	005	It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning,
Judges	019	006	So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together:
Judges	019	007	The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him,
Judges	019	008	He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
Judges	019	009	When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,
Judges	019	010	But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed,
Judges	019	011	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
Judges	019	012	His master said to him, We won't turn aside into the city
Judges	019	013	He said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one
Judges	019	014	So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
Judges	019	015	They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah:
Judges	019	016	Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even:
Judges	019	017	He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street
Judges	019	018	He said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther
Judges	019	019	Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys;
Judges	019	020	The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants
Judges	019	021	So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder;
Judges	019	022	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
Judges	019	023	The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said
Judges	019	024	Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine;
Judges	019	025	But the men wouldn't listen to him:  so the man laid hold
Judges	019	026	Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell
Judges	019	027	Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
Judges	019	028	He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered:
Judges	019	029	When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on
Judges	019	030	It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed
Judges	020	001	Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
Judges	020	002	The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
Judges	020	003	(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
Judges	020	004	The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered,
Judges	020	005	The men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
Judges	020	006	I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
Judges	020	007	Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your
Judges	020	008	All the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us
Judges	020	009	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah:
Judges	020	010	and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all
Judges	020	011	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,
Judges	020	012	The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
Judges	020	013	Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah,
Judges	020	014	The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
Judges	020	015	The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out
Judges	020	016	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen
Judges	020	017	The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
Judges	020	018	The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked
Judges	020	019	The children of Israel rose up in the morning,
Judges	020	020	The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;
Judges	020	021	The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah,
Judges	020	022	The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves,
Judges	020	023	The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even;
Judges	020	024	The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin
Judges	020	025	Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,
Judges	020	026	Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
Judges	020	027	The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant
Judges	020	028	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before
Judges	020	029	Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.
Judges	020	030	The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
Judges	020	031	The children of Benjamin went out against the people,
Judges	020	032	The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us,
Judges	020	033	All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set
Judges	020	034	There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out
Judges	020	035	Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel
Judges	020	036	So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck;
Judges	020	037	The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers
Judges	020	038	Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers
Judges	020	039	The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began
Judges	020	040	But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar
Judges	020	041	The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed;
Judges	020	042	Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
Judges	020	043	They enclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them,
Judges	020	044	There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were]
Judges	020	045	They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon:
Judges	020	046	So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five
Judges	020	047	But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to
Judges	020	048	The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin,
Judges	021	001	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall
Judges	021	002	The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God,
Judges	021	003	They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel,
Judges	021	004	It happened on the next day that the people rose early,
Judges	021	005	The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes
Judges	021	006	The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother,
Judges	021	007	How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we
Judges	021	008	They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't
Judges	021	009	For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none
Judges	021	010	The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant,
Judges	021	011	This is the thing that you shall do:  you shall utterly destroy
Judges	021	012	They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred
Judges	021	013	The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin
Judges	021	014	Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women
Judges	021	015	The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made
Judges	021	016	Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
Judges	021	017	They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped
Judges	021	018	However we may not give them wives of our daughters,
Judges	021	019	They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year
Judges	021	020	They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie
Judges	021	021	and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out
Judges	021	022	It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain
Judges	021	023	The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to
Judges	021	024	The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man
Judges	021	025	In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did
Ruth	001	001	It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there
Ruth	001	002	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi,
Ruth	001	003	Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left,
Ruth	001	004	They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name
Ruth	001	005	Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left
Ruth	001	006	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
Ruth	001	007	She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
Ruth	001	008	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
Ruth	001	009	Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house
Ruth	001	010	They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.
Ruth	001	011	Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me?
Ruth	001	012	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have
Ruth	001	013	would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you
Ruth	001	014	They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed
Ruth	001	015	She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people,
Ruth	001	016	Ruth said, "Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return
Ruth	001	017	where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried:
Ruth	001	018	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,
Ruth	001	019	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened,
Ruth	001	020	She said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara;
Ruth	001	021	I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty;
Ruth	001	022	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
Ruth	002	001	Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
Ruth	002	002	Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
Ruth	002	003	She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
Ruth	002	004	Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers,
Ruth	002	005	Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers,
Ruth	002	006	The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite
Ruth	002	007	She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers
Ruth	002	008	Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter?
Ruth	002	009	Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them:
Ruth	002	010	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
Ruth	002	011	Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you
Ruth	002	012	Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you
Ruth	002	013	Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,
Ruth	002	014	At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread,
Ruth	002	015	When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his
Ruth	002	016	Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it,
Ruth	002	017	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that
Ruth	002	018	She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law
Ruth	002	019	Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and
Ruth	002	020	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh,
Ruth	002	021	Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep
Ruth	002	022	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter,
Ruth	002	023	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end
Ruth	003	001	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I
Ruth	003	002	Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were?
Ruth	003	003	Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing
Ruth	003	004	It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place
Ruth	003	005	She said to her, All that you say I will do.
Ruth	003	006	She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all
Ruth	003	007	When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
Ruth	003	008	It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself;
Ruth	003	009	He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid:
Ruth	003	010	He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter:
Ruth	003	011	Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that
Ruth	003	012	Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is
Ruth	003	013	Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
Ruth	003	014	She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before
Ruth	003	015	He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it;
Ruth	003	016	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you,
Ruth	003	017	She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said,
Ruth	003	018	Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how
Ruth	004	001	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there:
Ruth	004	002	He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you
Ruth	004	003	He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out
Ruth	004	004	I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before
Ruth	004	005	Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi,
Ruth	004	006	The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I
Ruth	004	007	Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning
Ruth	004	008	So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself.
Ruth	004	009	Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses
Ruth	004	010	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
Ruth	004	011	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
Ruth	004	012	and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar
Ruth	004	013	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her,
Ruth	004	014	The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left
Ruth	004	015	He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you
Ruth	004	016	Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
Ruth	004	017	The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son
Ruth	004	018	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became
Ruth	004	019	and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became
Ruth	004	020	and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became
Ruth	004	021	and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became
Ruth	004	022	and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became
1 Samuel	001	001	Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim,
1 Samuel	001	002	and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah,
1 Samuel	001	003	This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship
1 Samuel	001	004	When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah
1 Samuel	001	005	but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah,
1 Samuel	001	006	Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh
1 Samuel	001	007	[as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
1 Samuel	001	008	Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why
1 Samuel	001	009	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
1 Samuel	001	010	She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh,
1 Samuel	001	011	She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed
1 Samuel	001	012	It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli
1 Samuel	001	013	Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved,
1 Samuel	001	014	Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your
1 Samuel	001	015	Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit:
1 Samuel	001	016	Don't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out
1 Samuel	001	017	Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant
1 Samuel	001	018	She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.
1 Samuel	001	019	They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh,
1 Samuel	001	020	It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived,
1 Samuel	001	021	The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh
1 Samuel	001	022	But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not
1 Samuel	001	023	Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good;
1 Samuel	001	024	When she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
1 Samuel	001	025	They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel	001	026	She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am
1 Samuel	001	027	For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition
1 Samuel	001	028	therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives
1 Samuel	002	001	Hannah prayed, and said:  My heart exults in Yahweh!  My horn
1 Samuel	002	002	There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you,
1 Samuel	002	003	Talk no more so exceeding proudly.  Don't let arrogance
1 Samuel	002	004	The bows of the mighty men are broken.  Those who stumbled
1 Samuel	002	005	Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.
1 Samuel	002	006	Yahweh kills, and makes alive.  He brings down to Sheol,
1 Samuel	002	007	Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.  He brings low,
1 Samuel	002	008	He raises up the poor out of the dust.  He lifts up the needy
1 Samuel	002	009	He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put
1 Samuel	002	010	Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
1 Samuel	002	011	Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  The child did minister
1 Samuel	002	012	Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.
1 Samuel	002	013	The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man
1 Samuel	002	014	and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
1 Samuel	002	015	Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said
1 Samuel	002	016	If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first,
1 Samuel	002	017	The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh;
1 Samuel	002	018	But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child,
1 Samuel	002	019	Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it
1 Samuel	002	020	Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed
1 Samuel	002	021	Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons
1 Samuel	002	022	Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did
1 Samuel	002	023	He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your
1 Samuel	002	024	No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear:
1 Samuel	002	025	If one man sin against another, God shall judge him;
1 Samuel	002	026	The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh,
1 Samuel	002	027	There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says
1 Samuel	002	028	and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be
1 Samuel	002	029	Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have
1 Samuel	002	030	Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed
1 Samuel	002	031	Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm
1 Samuel	002	032	You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth
1 Samuel	002	033	The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar,
1 Samuel	002	034	This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons,
1 Samuel	002	035	I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
1 Samuel	002	036	It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall
1 Samuel	003	001	The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli.
1 Samuel	003	002	It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place
1 Samuel	003	003	and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had laid
1 Samuel	003	004	that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel	003	005	He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.
1 Samuel	003	006	Yahweh called yet again, Samuel.  Samuel arose and went to Eli,
1 Samuel	003	007	Now Samuel didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word
1 Samuel	003	008	Yahweh called Samuel again the third time.  He arose
1 Samuel	003	009	Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down:  and it shall be,
1 Samuel	003	010	Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
1 Samuel	003	011	Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
1 Samuel	003	012	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken
1 Samuel	003	013	For I have told him that I will judge his house forever,
1 Samuel	003	014	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity
1 Samuel	003	015	Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house
1 Samuel	003	016	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.
1 Samuel	003	017	He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you?
1 Samuel	003	018	Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.
1 Samuel	003	019	Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his
1 Samuel	003	020	All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
1 Samuel	003	021	Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself
1 Samuel	004	001	The word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out
1 Samuel	004	002	The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
1 Samuel	004	003	When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said,
1 Samuel	004	004	So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark
1 Samuel	004	005	When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp,
1 Samuel	004	006	When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
1 Samuel	004	007	The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
1 Samuel	004	008	Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
1 Samuel	004	009	Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines,
1 Samuel	004	010	The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled
1 Samuel	004	011	The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
1 Samuel	004	012	There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh
1 Samuel	004	013	When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the
1 Samuel	004	014	When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means
1 Samuel	004	015	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set,
1 Samuel	004	016	The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled
1 Samuel	004	017	He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before
1 Samuel	004	018	It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli]
1 Samuel	004	019	His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,
1 Samuel	004	020	About the time of her death the women who stood by her said
1 Samuel	004	021	She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
1 Samuel	004	022	She said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark
1 Samuel	005	001	Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought
1 Samuel	005	002	The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into
1 Samuel	005	003	When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was
1 Samuel	005	004	When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was
1 Samuel	005	005	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into
1 Samuel	005	006	But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod,
1 Samuel	005	007	When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said,
1 Samuel	005	008	They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
1 Samuel	005	009	It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand
1 Samuel	005	010	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  It happened, as the ark
1 Samuel	005	011	They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of
1 Samuel	005	012	The men who didn't die were struck with the tumors;
1 Samuel	006	001	The ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel	006	002	The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
1 Samuel	006	003	They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send
1 Samuel	006	004	Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we
1 Samuel	006	005	Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your
1 Samuel	006	006	Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh
1 Samuel	006	007	Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart,
1 Samuel	006	008	and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put
1 Samuel	006	009	Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to
1 Samuel	006	010	The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart,
1 Samuel	006	011	and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer
1 Samuel	006	012	The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh;
1 Samuel	006	013	They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley;
1 Samuel	006	014	The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh,
1 Samuel	006	015	The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that
1 Samuel	006	016	When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned
1 Samuel	006	017	These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for
1 Samuel	006	018	and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
1 Samuel	006	019	He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked
1 Samuel	006	020	The men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh,
1 Samuel	006	021	They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim,
1 Samuel	007	001	The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh,
1 Samuel	007	002	It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath Jearim,
1 Samuel	007	003	Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you
1 Samuel	007	004	Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth,
1 Samuel	007	005	Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray
1 Samuel	007	006	They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured
1 Samuel	007	007	When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
1 Samuel	007	008	The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don't cease to cry
1 Samuel	007	009	Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt
1 Samuel	007	010	As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
1 Samuel	007	011	The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,
1 Samuel	007	012	Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen,
1 Samuel	007	013	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within
1 Samuel	007	014	The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
1 Samuel	007	015	Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel	007	016	He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal,
1 Samuel	007	017	His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there
1 Samuel	008	001	It happened, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
1 Samuel	008	002	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of
1 Samuel	008	003	His sons didn't walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
1 Samuel	008	004	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
1 Samuel	008	005	and they said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons
1 Samuel	008	006	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king
1 Samuel	008	007	Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people
1 Samuel	008	008	According to all the works which they have done since the day
1 Samuel	008	009	Now therefore listen to their voice:  however you shall protest
1 Samuel	008	010	Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked
1 Samuel	008	011	He said, This will be the manner of the king who shall reign
1 Samuel	008	012	and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands,
1 Samuel	008	013	He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks,
1 Samuel	008	014	He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves,
1 Samuel	008	015	He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
1 Samuel	008	016	He will take your male servants, and your female servants,
1 Samuel	008	017	He will take the tenth of your flocks:  and you shall
1 Samuel	008	018	You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall
1 Samuel	008	019	But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel;
1 Samuel	008	020	that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king
1 Samuel	008	021	Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
1 Samuel	008	022	Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king.
1 Samuel	009	001	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
1 Samuel	009	002	He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man;
1 Samuel	009	003	The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost.  Kish said
1 Samuel	009	004	He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed
1 Samuel	009	005	When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
1 Samuel	009	006	He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God,
1 Samuel	009	007	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
1 Samuel	009	008	The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
1 Samuel	009	009	(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God,
1 Samuel	009	010	Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.
1 Samuel	009	011	As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens
1 Samuel	009	012	They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you:
1 Samuel	009	013	as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately
1 Samuel	009	014	They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city,
1 Samuel	009	015	Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
1 Samuel	009	016	Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land
1 Samuel	009	017	When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man
1 Samuel	009	018	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,
1 Samuel	009	019	Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before
1 Samuel	009	020	As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago,
1 Samuel	009	021	Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest
1 Samuel	009	022	Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
1 Samuel	009	023	Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you,
1 Samuel	009	024	The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it
1 Samuel	009	025	When they were come down from the high place into the city,
1 Samuel	009	026	They arose early:  and it happened about the spring of the day,
1 Samuel	009	027	As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said
1 Samuel	010	001	Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head,
1 Samuel	010	002	When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men
1 Samuel	010	003	Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall
1 Samuel	010	004	and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread,
1 Samuel	010	005	After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is
1 Samuel	010	006	and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall
1 Samuel	010	007	Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do
1 Samuel	010	008	You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come
1 Samuel	010	009	It was so, that when he had turned his back to go
1 Samuel	010	010	When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets
1 Samuel	010	011	It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold,
1 Samuel	010	012	One of the same place answered, Who is their father?
1 Samuel	010	013	When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1 Samuel	010	014	Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?
1 Samuel	010	015	Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.
1 Samuel	010	016	Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys
1 Samuel	010	017	Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
1 Samuel	010	018	and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh,
1 Samuel	010	019	but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves
1 Samuel	010	020	So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe
1 Samuel	010	021	He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families;
1 Samuel	010	022	Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man
1 Samuel	010	023	They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among
1 Samuel	010	024	Samuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh
1 Samuel	010	025	Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,
1 Samuel	010	026	Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him
1 Samuel	010	027	But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?
1 Samuel	011	001	Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead:
1 Samuel	011	002	Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I
1 Samuel	011	003	The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we
1 Samuel	011	004	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these
1 Samuel	011	005	Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field;
1 Samuel	011	006	The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words,
1 Samuel	011	007	He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent
1 Samuel	011	008	He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were
1 Samuel	011	009	They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell
1 Samuel	011	010	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you,
1 Samuel	011	011	It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in
1 Samuel	011	012	The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign
1 Samuel	011	013	Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day;
1 Samuel	011	014	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
1 Samuel	011	015	All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
1 Samuel	012	001	Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice
1 Samuel	012	002	Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old
1 Samuel	012	003	Here I am:  witness against me before Yahweh, and before
1 Samuel	012	004	They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
1 Samuel	012	005	He said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed
1 Samuel	012	006	Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron,
1 Samuel	012	007	Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you
1 Samuel	012	008	When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh,
1 Samuel	012	009	But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand
1 Samuel	012	010	They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have
1 Samuel	012	011	Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,
1 Samuel	012	012	When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came
1 Samuel	012	013	Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you
1 Samuel	012	014	If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice,
1 Samuel	012	015	but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel
1 Samuel	012	016	Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh
1 Samuel	012	017	Isn't it wheat harvest today?  I will call to Yahweh,
1 Samuel	012	018	So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain
1 Samuel	012	019	All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh
1 Samuel	012	020	Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed
1 Samuel	012	021	and don't turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things
1 Samuel	012	022	For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake,
1 Samuel	012	023	Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against
1 Samuel	012	024	Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart;
1 Samuel	012	025	But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed,
1 Samuel	013	001	Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign;
1 Samuel	013	002	Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, of which two
1 Samuel	013	003	Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba:
1 Samuel	013	004	All Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of
1 Samuel	013	005	The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel,
1 Samuel	013	006	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait
1 Samuel	013	007	Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land
1 Samuel	013	008	He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
1 Samuel	013	009	Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the
1 Samuel	013	010	It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering
1 Samuel	013	011	Samuel said, What have you done?  Saul said, Because I saw
1 Samuel	013	012	therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me
1 Samuel	013	013	Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept
1 Samuel	013	014	But now your kingdom shall not continue:  Yahweh has sought
1 Samuel	013	015	Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.
1 Samuel	013	016	Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present
1 Samuel	013	017	The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
1 Samuel	013	018	and another company turned the way to Beth Horon;
1 Samuel	013	019	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel;
1 Samuel	013	020	but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
1 Samuel	013	021	yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares,
1 Samuel	013	022	So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
1 Samuel	013	023	The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel	014	001	Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
1 Samuel	014	002	Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate
1 Samuel	014	003	and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,
1 Samuel	014	004	Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to
1 Samuel	014	005	The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash,
1 Samuel	014	006	Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come,
1 Samuel	014	007	His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart:
1 Samuel	014	008	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men,
1 Samuel	014	009	If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we
1 Samuel	014	010	But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up;
1 Samuel	014	011	Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines:
1 Samuel	014	012	The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer,
1 Samuel	014	013	Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his
1 Samuel	014	014	That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made,
1 Samuel	014	015	There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all
1 Samuel	014	016	The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold,
1 Samuel	014	017	Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now,
1 Samuel	014	018	Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God.  For the ark
1 Samuel	014	019	It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult
1 Samuel	014	020	Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together,
1 Samuel	014	021	Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before,
1 Samuel	014	022	Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill
1 Samuel	014	023	So Yahweh saved Israel that day:  and the battle passed over
1 Samuel	014	024	The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had
1 Samuel	014	025	All the people came into the forest; and there was honey
1 Samuel	014	026	When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped:
1 Samuel	014	027	But Jonathan didn't hear when his father charged the people
1 Samuel	014	028	Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly
1 Samuel	014	029	Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land.
1 Samuel	014	030	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today
1 Samuel	014	031	They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon.
1 Samuel	014	032	and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
1 Samuel	014	033	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin
1 Samuel	014	034	Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them,
1 Samuel	014	035	Saul built an altar to Yahweh:  the same was the first altar
1 Samuel	014	036	Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
1 Samuel	014	037	Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
1 Samuel	014	038	Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people;
1 Samuel	014	039	For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan
1 Samuel	014	040	Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side,
1 Samuel	014	041	Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right.
1 Samuel	014	042	Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son.
1 Samuel	014	043	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done.
1 Samuel	014	044	Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall
1 Samuel	014	045	The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has
1 Samuel	014	046	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines;
1 Samuel	014	047	Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought
1 Samuel	014	048	He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered
1 Samuel	014	049	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua;
1 Samuel	014	050	and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.
1 Samuel	014	051	Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
1 Samuel	014	052	There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
1 Samuel	015	001	Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king
1 Samuel	015	002	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek
1 Samuel	015	003	Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
1 Samuel	015	004	Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim,
1 Samuel	015	005	Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1 Samuel	015	006	Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among
1 Samuel	015	007	Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur,
1 Samuel	015	008	He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
1 Samuel	015	009	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
1 Samuel	015	010	Then came the word of Yahweh to Samuel, saying,
1 Samuel	015	011	It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned
1 Samuel	015	012	Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it
1 Samuel	015	013	Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed are you
1 Samuel	015	014	Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears,
1 Samuel	015	015	Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
1 Samuel	015	016	Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh
1 Samuel	015	017	Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight,
1 Samuel	015	018	and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly
1 Samuel	015	019	Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil,
1 Samuel	015	020	Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh,
1 Samuel	015	021	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
1 Samuel	015	022	Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings
1 Samuel	015	023	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
1 Samuel	015	024	Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed
1 Samuel	015	025	Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
1 Samuel	015	026	Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you
1 Samuel	015	027	As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt
1 Samuel	015	028	Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel
1 Samuel	015	029	Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent;
1 Samuel	015	030	Then he said, I have sinned:  yet honor me now, Please, before the
1 Samuel	015	031	So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.
1 Samuel	015	032	Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king
1 Samuel	015	033	Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall
1 Samuel	015	034	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house
1 Samuel	015	035	Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death;
1 Samuel	016	001	Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I
1 Samuel	016	002	Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
1 Samuel	016	003	Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do:
1 Samuel	016	004	Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem.
1 Samuel	016	005	He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh:
1 Samuel	016	006	It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab,
1 Samuel	016	007	But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on
1 Samuel	016	008	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
1 Samuel	016	009	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  He said, Neither has
1 Samuel	016	010	Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
1 Samuel	016	011	Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?
1 Samuel	016	012	He sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy,
1 Samuel	016	013	Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
1 Samuel	016	014	Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
1 Samuel	016	015	Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from
1 Samuel	016	016	Let our lord now command your servants who are before you,
1 Samuel	016	017	Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well,
1 Samuel	016	018	Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen
1 Samuel	016	019	Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me
1 Samuel	016	020	Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine,
1 Samuel	016	021	David came to Saul, and stood before him:  and he loved him greatly;
1 Samuel	016	022	Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me;
1 Samuel	016	023	It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul,
1 Samuel	017	001	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle;
1 Samuel	017	002	Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,
1 Samuel	017	003	The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,
1 Samuel	017	004	There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
1 Samuel	017	005	He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a
1 Samuel	017	006	He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass
1 Samuel	017	007	The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam;
1 Samuel	017	008	He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them,
1 Samuel	017	009	If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we
1 Samuel	017	010	The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
1 Samuel	017	011	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
1 Samuel	017	012	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah,
1 Samuel	017	013	The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle:
1 Samuel	017	014	David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel	017	015	Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's
1 Samuel	017	016	The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
1 Samuel	017	017	Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers
1 Samuel	017	018	and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand,
1 Samuel	017	019	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley
1 Samuel	017	020	David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
1 Samuel	017	021	Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array,
1 Samuel	017	022	David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage,
1 Samuel	017	023	As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
1 Samuel	017	024	All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
1 Samuel	017	025	The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come
1 Samuel	017	026	David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall
1 Samuel	017	027	The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall
1 Samuel	017	028	Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's
1 Samuel	017	029	David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?
1 Samuel	017	030	He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after
1 Samuel	017	031	When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed
1 Samuel	017	032	David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;
1 Samuel	017	033	Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this
1 Samuel	017	034	David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep;
1 Samuel	017	035	I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out
1 Samuel	017	036	Your servant struck both the lion and the bear:
1 Samuel	017	037	David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion,
1 Samuel	017	038	Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass
1 Samuel	017	039	David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go;
1 Samuel	017	040	He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
1 Samuel	017	041	The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man
1 Samuel	017	042	When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him;
1 Samuel	017	043	The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me
1 Samuel	017	044	The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
1 Samuel	017	045	Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword,
1 Samuel	017	046	This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will
1 Samuel	017	047	and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't
1 Samuel	017	048	It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near
1 Samuel	017	049	David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone,
1 Samuel	017	050	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and
1 Samuel	017	051	Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword,
1 Samuel	017	052	The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
1 Samuel	017	053	The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines,
1 Samuel	017	054	David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem;
1 Samuel	017	055	When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner,
1 Samuel	017	056	The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"
1 Samuel	017	057	As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
1 Samuel	017	058	Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?
1 Samuel	018	001	It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul,
1 Samuel	018	002	Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
1 Samuel	018	003	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
1 Samuel	018	004	Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him,
1 Samuel	018	005	David went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely:
1 Samuel	018	006	It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter
1 Samuel	018	007	The women sang one to another as they played, and said,
1 Samuel	018	008	Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him;
1 Samuel	018	009	Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Samuel	018	010	It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came
1 Samuel	018	011	and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David
1 Samuel	018	012	Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him,
1 Samuel	018	013	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
1 Samuel	018	014	David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh
1 Samuel	018	015	When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood
1 Samuel	018	016	But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came
1 Samuel	018	017	Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give
1 Samuel	018	018	David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my
1 Samuel	018	019	But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter,
1 Samuel	018	020	Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David:  and they told Saul,
1 Samuel	018	021	Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him,
1 Samuel	018	022	Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly,
1 Samuel	018	023	Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David.
1 Samuel	018	024	The servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
1 Samuel	018	025	Saul said, Thus shall you tell David, The king desires
1 Samuel	018	026	When his servants told David these words, it pleased David
1 Samuel	018	027	and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed
1 Samuel	018	028	Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David;
1 Samuel	018	029	Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was
1 Samuel	018	030	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth:
1 Samuel	019	001	Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
1 Samuel	019	002	Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you:
1 Samuel	019	003	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
1 Samuel	019	004	Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him,
1 Samuel	019	005	for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine,
1 Samuel	019	006	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan:  and Saul swore,
1 Samuel	019	007	Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.
1 Samuel	019	008	There was war again:  and David went out, and fought with
1 Samuel	019	009	An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house
1 Samuel	019	010	Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear;
1 Samuel	019	011	Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him,
1 Samuel	019	012	So Michal let David down through the window:  and he went,
1 Samuel	019	013	Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put
1 Samuel	019	014	When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1 Samuel	019	015	Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up
1 Samuel	019	016	When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed,
1 Samuel	019	017	Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my
1 Samuel	019	018	Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
1 Samuel	019	019	It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel	019	020	Saul sent messengers to take David:  and when they saw the company
1 Samuel	019	021	When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
1 Samuel	019	022	Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well
1 Samuel	019	023	He went there to Naioth in Ramah:  and the Spirit of God came
1 Samuel	019	024	He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied
1 Samuel	020	001	David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said
1 Samuel	020	002	He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die:  behold, my father
1 Samuel	020	003	David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows
1 Samuel	020	004	Then said Jonathan to David, "Whatever your soul desires,
1 Samuel	020	005	David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,
1 Samuel	020	006	If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly
1 Samuel	020	007	If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace:
1 Samuel	020	008	Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have
1 Samuel	020	009	Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all
1 Samuel	020	010	Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance
1 Samuel	020	011	Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field."
1 Samuel	020	012	Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]:
1 Samuel	020	013	Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my
1 Samuel	020	014	You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness
1 Samuel	020	015	but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever;
1 Samuel	020	016	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying],
1 Samuel	020	017	Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had
1 Samuel	020	018	Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon:
1 Samuel	020	019	When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly,
1 Samuel	020	020	I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot
1 Samuel	020	021	Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows.
1 Samuel	020	022	But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you;
1 Samuel	020	023	As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold,
1 Samuel	020	024	So David hid himself in the field:  and when the new moon was come,
1 Samuel	020	025	The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat
1 Samuel	020	026	Nevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day:
1 Samuel	020	027	It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was]
1 Samuel	020	028	Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
1 Samuel	020	029	and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice
1 Samuel	020	030	Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
1 Samuel	020	031	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall
1 Samuel	020	032	Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should
1 Samuel	020	033	Saul cast his spear at him to strike him.  By this Jonathan
1 Samuel	020	034	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food
1 Samuel	020	035	It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field
1 Samuel	020	036	He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.
1 Samuel	020	037	When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which
1 Samuel	020	038	Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast!  Hurry!  Don't delay!
1 Samuel	020	039	But the boy didn't know anything:  only Jonathan and David
1 Samuel	020	040	Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go,
1 Samuel	020	041	As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place]
1 Samuel	020	042	Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn
1 Samuel	021	001	Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest:
1 Samuel	021	002	David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me
1 Samuel	021	003	Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves
1 Samuel	021	004	The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
1 Samuel	021	005	David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth
1 Samuel	021	006	So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread
1 Samuel	021	007	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
1 Samuel	021	008	David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear
1 Samuel	021	009	The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
1 Samuel	021	010	David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
1 Samuel	021	011	The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David
1 Samuel	021	012	David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid
1 Samuel	021	013	He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad
1 Samuel	021	014	Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad;
1 Samuel	021	015	Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play
1 Samuel	022	001	David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam:
1 Samuel	022	002	Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt,
1 Samuel	022	003	David went there to Mizpeh of Moab:  and he said to the king
1 Samuel	022	004	He brought them before the king of Moab:  and they lived
1 Samuel	022	005	The prophet Gad said to David, Don't stay in the stronghold;
1 Samuel	022	006	Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him:
1 Samuel	022	007	Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now,
1 Samuel	022	008	that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
1 Samuel	022	009	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants
1 Samuel	022	010	He inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him food, and gave
1 Samuel	022	011	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub,
1 Samuel	022	012	Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.  He answered,
1 Samuel	022	013	Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me,
1 Samuel	022	014	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your
1 Samuel	022	015	Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me:
1 Samuel	022	016	The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all
1 Samuel	022	017	The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill
1 Samuel	022	018	The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests.
1 Samuel	022	019	Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of
1 Samuel	022	020	One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
1 Samuel	022	021	Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh's priests.
1 Samuel	022	022	David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite
1 Samuel	022	023	Abide you with me, don't be afraid; for he who seeks my life
1 Samuel	023	001	They told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting
1 Samuel	023	002	Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike
1 Samuel	023	003	David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah:
1 Samuel	023	004	Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again.  Yahweh answered him,
1 Samuel	023	005	David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,
1 Samuel	023	006	It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David
1 Samuel	023	007	It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  Saul said,
1 Samuel	023	008	Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah,
1 Samuel	023	009	David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him;
1 Samuel	023	010	Then said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has
1 Samuel	023	011	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?
1 Samuel	023	012	Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me
1 Samuel	023	013	Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and
1 Samuel	023	014	David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds,
1 Samuel	023	015	David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life:
1 Samuel	023	016	Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood,
1 Samuel	023	017	He said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father
1 Samuel	023	018	They two made a covenant before Yahweh:  and David abode
1 Samuel	023	019	Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David
1 Samuel	023	020	Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire
1 Samuel	023	021	Saul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had
1 Samuel	023	022	Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place
1 Samuel	023	023	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
1 Samuel	023	024	They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul:  but David and his men
1 Samuel	023	025	Saul and his men went to seek him.  When David was told,
1 Samuel	023	026	Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men
1 Samuel	023	027	But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come;
1 Samuel	023	028	So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
1 Samuel	023	029	David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds
1 Samuel	024	001	It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines,
1 Samuel	024	002	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
1 Samuel	024	003	He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave;
1 Samuel	024	004	The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh
1 Samuel	024	005	It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him,
1 Samuel	024	006	He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing
1 Samuel	024	007	So David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow
1 Samuel	024	008	David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave,
1 Samuel	024	009	David said to Saul, Why listen you to men's words, saying,
1 Samuel	024	010	Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh
1 Samuel	024	011	Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe
1 Samuel	024	012	Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you;
1 Samuel	024	013	As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes
1 Samuel	024	014	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you
1 Samuel	024	015	Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you,
1 Samuel	024	016	It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
1 Samuel	024	017	He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have
1 Samuel	024	018	You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me,
1 Samuel	024	019	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed?
1 Samuel	024	020	Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that
1 Samuel	024	021	Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut
1 Samuel	024	022	David swore to Saul.  Saul went home; but David and his men
1 Samuel	025	001	Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together,
1 Samuel	025	002	There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
1 Samuel	025	003	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail;
1 Samuel	025	004	David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel	025	005	David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men,
1 Samuel	025	006	and thus shall you tell him who lives [in prosperity],
1 Samuel	025	007	Now I have heard that you have shearers:  your shepherds have
1 Samuel	025	008	Ask your young men, and they will tell you:  therefore let
1 Samuel	025	009	When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according
1 Samuel	025	010	Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
1 Samuel	025	011	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I
1 Samuel	025	012	So David's young men turned on their way, and went back,
1 Samuel	025	013	David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword.
1 Samuel	025	014	But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
1 Samuel	025	015	But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt,
1 Samuel	025	016	they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we
1 Samuel	025	017	Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil
1 Samuel	025	018	Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves,
1 Samuel	025	019	She said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.
1 Samuel	025	020	It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert
1 Samuel	025	021	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
1 Samuel	025	022	God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave
1 Samuel	025	023	When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey,
1 Samuel	025	024	She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be
1 Samuel	025	025	Please don't let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal;
1 Samuel	025	026	Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives,
1 Samuel	025	027	Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord,
1 Samuel	025	028	Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid:  for Yahweh
1 Samuel	025	029	Though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul,
1 Samuel	025	030	It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord
1 Samuel	025	031	that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart
1 Samuel	025	032	David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
1 Samuel	025	033	and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have
1 Samuel	025	034	For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has
1 Samuel	025	035	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him:
1 Samuel	025	036	Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house,
1 Samuel	025	037	It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,
1 Samuel	025	038	It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal,
1 Samuel	025	039	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh,
1 Samuel	025	040	When the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
1 Samuel	025	041	She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth,
1 Samuel	025	042	Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies
1 Samuel	025	043	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both
1 Samuel	025	044	Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife,
1 Samuel	026	001	The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide
1 Samuel	026	002	Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
1 Samuel	026	003	Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert,
1 Samuel	026	004	David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
1 Samuel	026	005	David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped;
1 Samuel	026	006	Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite,
1 Samuel	026	007	So David and Abishai came to the people by night:
1 Samuel	026	008	Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy
1 Samuel	026	009	David said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth
1 Samuel	026	010	David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day
1 Samuel	026	011	Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against
1 Samuel	026	012	So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head;
1 Samuel	026	013	Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
1 Samuel	026	014	and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
1 Samuel	026	015	David said to Abner, Aren't you a [valiant] man? and who is like
1 Samuel	026	016	This thing isn't good that you have done.  As Yahweh lives,
1 Samuel	026	017	Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice,
1 Samuel	026	018	He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what
1 Samuel	026	019	Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words
1 Samuel	026	020	Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away
1 Samuel	026	021	Then said Saul, I have sinned:  return, my son David;
1 Samuel	026	022	David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of
1 Samuel	026	023	Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and
1 Samuel	026	024	Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes,
1 Samuel	026	025	Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David:
1 Samuel	027	001	David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand
1 Samuel	027	002	David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men
1 Samuel	027	003	David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
1 Samuel	027	004	It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath:  and he sought
1 Samuel	027	005	David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes,
1 Samuel	027	006	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day:  why Ziklag pertains
1 Samuel	027	007	The number of the days that David lived in the country
1 Samuel	027	008	David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites,
1 Samuel	027	009	David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive,
1 Samuel	027	010	Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today?
1 Samuel	027	011	David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath,
1 Samuel	027	012	Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel
1 Samuel	028	001	It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered
1 Samuel	028	002	David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant
1 Samuel	028	003	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him,
1 Samuel	028	004	The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
1 Samuel	028	005	When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid,
1 Samuel	028	006	When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer him,
1 Samuel	028	007	Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has
1 Samuel	028	008	Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went,
1 Samuel	028	009	The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done,
1 Samuel	028	010	Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives,
1 Samuel	028	011	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you?
1 Samuel	028	012	When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice;
1 Samuel	028	013	The king said to her, Don't be afraid:  for what do you see?
1 Samuel	028	014	He said to her, What form is he of?  She said, An old man
1 Samuel	028	015	Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up?
1 Samuel	028	016	Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed
1 Samuel	028	017	Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me:  and Yahweh has torn
1 Samuel	028	018	Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute
1 Samuel	028	019	Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand
1 Samuel	028	020	Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth,
1 Samuel	028	021	The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
1 Samuel	028	022	Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid,
1 Samuel	028	023	But he refused, and said, I will not eat.  But his servants,
1 Samuel	028	024	The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried,
1 Samuel	028	025	and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants;
1 Samuel	029	001	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
1 Samuel	029	002	The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands;
1 Samuel	029	003	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do]
1 Samuel	029	004	But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him;
1 Samuel	029	005	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
1 Samuel	029	006	Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives,
1 Samuel	029	007	Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease
1 Samuel	029	008	David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you
1 Samuel	029	009	Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight,
1 Samuel	029	010	Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants
1 Samuel	029	011	So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in
1 Samuel	030	001	It happened, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on
1 Samuel	030	002	and had taken captive the women [and all] who were therein,
1 Samuel	030	003	When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned
1 Samuel	030	004	Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their
1 Samuel	030	005	David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
1 Samuel	030	006	David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him,
1 Samuel	030	007	David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring
1 Samuel	030	008	David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop,
1 Samuel	030	009	So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,
1 Samuel	030	010	But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred
1 Samuel	030	011	They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,
1 Samuel	030	012	They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins:
1 Samuel	030	013	David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you?
1 Samuel	030	014	We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on
1 Samuel	030	015	David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop?
1 Samuel	030	016	When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad
1 Samuel	030	017	David struck them from the twilight even to the evening
1 Samuel	030	018	David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David
1 Samuel	030	019	There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
1 Samuel	030	020	David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove
1 Samuel	030	021	David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they
1 Samuel	030	022	Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who
1 Samuel	030	023	Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers,
1 Samuel	030	024	Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is
1 Samuel	030	025	It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
1 Samuel	030	026	When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders
1 Samuel	030	027	To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth
1 Samuel	030	028	and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth,
1 Samuel	030	029	and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities
1 Samuel	030	030	and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan,
1 Samuel	030	031	and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where
1 Samuel	031	001	Now the Philistines fought against Israel:  and the men of
1 Samuel	031	002	The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons;
1 Samuel	031	003	The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him;
1 Samuel	031	004	Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust
1 Samuel	031	005	When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell
1 Samuel	031	006	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer,
1 Samuel	031	007	When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley,
1 Samuel	031	008	It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip
1 Samuel	031	009	They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent
1 Samuel	031	010	They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they
1 Samuel	031	011	When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him
1 Samuel	031	012	all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body
1 Samuel	031	013	They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree
2 Samuel	001	001	It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned
2 Samuel	001	002	it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of
2 Samuel	001	003	David said to him, From whence come you?  He said to him,
2 Samuel	001	004	David said to him, How went the matter?  Please tell me.
2 Samuel	001	005	David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul
2 Samuel	001	006	The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on
2 Samuel	001	007	When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me.
2 Samuel	001	008	He said to me, Who are you?  I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
2 Samuel	001	009	He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me;
2 Samuel	001	010	So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was
2 Samuel	001	011	Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them;
2 Samuel	001	012	and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
2 Samuel	001	013	David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you?
2 Samuel	001	014	David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your
2 Samuel	001	015	David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
2 Samuel	001	016	David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has
2 Samuel	001	017	David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
2 Samuel	001	018	(and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of]
2 Samuel	001	019	Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!
2 Samuel	001	020	Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't publish it in the streets
2 Samuel	001	021	You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you,
2 Samuel	001	022	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
2 Samuel	001	023	Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
2 Samuel	001	024	You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
2 Samuel	001	025	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
2 Samuel	001	026	I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.  You have
2 Samuel	001	027	How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
2 Samuel	002	001	It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying,
2 Samuel	002	002	So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam
2 Samuel	002	003	His men who were with him did David bring up, every man
2 Samuel	002	004	The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
2 Samuel	002	005	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said
2 Samuel	002	006	Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you:
2 Samuel	002	007	Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant;
2 Samuel	002	008	Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken
2 Samuel	002	009	and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites,
2 Samuel	002	010	Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began
2 Samuel	002	011	The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
2 Samuel	002	012	Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
2 Samuel	002	013	Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
2 Samuel	002	014	Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play
2 Samuel	002	015	Then they arose and went over by number:  twelve for Benjamin,
2 Samuel	002	016	They caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust]
2 Samuel	002	017	The battle was very severe that day:  and Abner was beaten,
2 Samuel	002	018	The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
2 Samuel	002	019	Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn
2 Samuel	002	020	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel?
2 Samuel	002	021	Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left,
2 Samuel	002	022	Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me:
2 Samuel	002	023	However he refused to turn aside:  therefore Abner with the hinder
2 Samuel	002	024	But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner:  and the sun went
2 Samuel	002	025	The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner,
2 Samuel	002	026	Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever?
2 Samuel	002	027	Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then
2 Samuel	002	028	So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still,
2 Samuel	002	029	Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah;
2 Samuel	002	030	Joab returned from following Abner:  and when he had gathered
2 Samuel	002	031	But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men,
2 Samuel	002	032	They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father,
2 Samuel	003	001	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
2 Samuel	003	002	To David were sons born in Hebron:  and his firstborn was Amnon,
2 Samuel	003	003	and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
2 Samuel	003	004	and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
2 Samuel	003	005	and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife.
2 Samuel	003	006	It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul
2 Samuel	003	007	Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
2 Samuel	003	008	Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,
2 Samuel	003	009	God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn
2 Samuel	003	010	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
2 Samuel	003	011	He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
2 Samuel	003	012	Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
2 Samuel	003	013	He said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing
2 Samuel	003	014	David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying,
2 Samuel	003	015	Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
2 Samuel	003	016	Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed
2 Samuel	003	017	Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
2 Samuel	003	018	now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand
2 Samuel	003	019	Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin:  and Abner went
2 Samuel	003	020	So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
2 Samuel	003	021	Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel
2 Samuel	003	022	Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray,
2 Samuel	003	023	When Joab and all the army who was with him had come,
2 Samuel	003	024	Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold,
2 Samuel	003	025	You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you,
2 Samuel	003	026	When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
2 Samuel	003	027	When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into
2 Samuel	003	028	Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
2 Samuel	003	029	let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house;
2 Samuel	003	030	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had
2 Samuel	003	031	David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him,
2 Samuel	003	032	They buried Abner in Hebron:  and the king lifted up his voice,
2 Samuel	003	033	The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die
2 Samuel	003	034	Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters.
2 Samuel	003	035	All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day;
2 Samuel	003	036	All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them;
2 Samuel	003	037	So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
2 Samuel	003	038	The king said to his servants, "Don't you know that there
2 Samuel	003	039	I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
2 Samuel	004	001	When [Ishbosheth], Saul's son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron,
2 Samuel	004	002	[Ishbosheth], Saul's son, [had] two men who were captains of bands:
2 Samuel	004	003	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners
2 Samuel	004	004	Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet.
2 Samuel	004	005	The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
2 Samuel	004	006	They came there into the midst of the house, as though they
2 Samuel	004	007	Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed
2 Samuel	004	008	They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron,
2 Samuel	004	009	David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons
2 Samuel	004	010	when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
2 Samuel	004	011	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
2 Samuel	004	012	David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut
2 Samuel	005	001	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron,
2 Samuel	005	002	In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you
2 Samuel	005	003	So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
2 Samuel	005	004	David was thirty years old when he began to reign,
2 Samuel	005	005	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months;
2 Samuel	005	006	The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites,
2 Samuel	005	007	Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is
2 Samuel	005	008	David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites,
2 Samuel	005	009	David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David.
2 Samuel	005	010	David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies,
2 Samuel	005	011	Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
2 Samuel	005	012	David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel,
2 Samuel	005	013	David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
2 Samuel	005	014	These are the names of those who were born to him
2 Samuel	005	015	and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
2 Samuel	005	016	and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2 Samuel	005	017	When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
2 Samuel	005	018	Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the
2 Samuel	005	019	David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against
2 Samuel	005	020	David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said,
2 Samuel	005	021	They left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
2 Samuel	005	022	The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
2 Samuel	005	023	When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You shall not go up:
2 Samuel	005	024	It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
2 Samuel	005	025	David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines
2 Samuel	006	001	David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
2 Samuel	006	002	David arose, and went with all the people who were with him,
2 Samuel	006	003	They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it
2 Samuel	006	004	They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill,
2 Samuel	006	005	David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all
2 Samuel	006	006	When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put
2 Samuel	006	007	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck
2 Samuel	006	008	David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah;
2 Samuel	006	009	David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and he said, How shall
2 Samuel	006	010	So David would not remove the ark of Yahweh to him into
2 Samuel	006	011	The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom
2 Samuel	006	012	It was told king David, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house
2 Samuel	006	013	It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone
2 Samuel	006	014	David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was
2 Samuel	006	015	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh
2 Samuel	006	016	It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David,
2 Samuel	006	017	They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place,
2 Samuel	006	018	When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering
2 Samuel	006	019	He dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
2 Samuel	006	020	Then David returned to bless his household.
2 Samuel	006	021	David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me
2 Samuel	006	022	I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my
2 Samuel	006	023	Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
2 Samuel	007	001	It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh
2 Samuel	007	002	that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
2 Samuel	007	003	Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart;
2 Samuel	007	004	It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came
2 Samuel	007	005	Go and tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you
2 Samuel	007	006	for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
2 Samuel	007	007	In all places in which I have walked with all the children
2 Samuel	007	008	Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
2 Samuel	007	009	and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all
2 Samuel	007	010	I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
2 Samuel	007	011	and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my
2 Samuel	007	012	When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers,
2 Samuel	007	013	He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish
2 Samuel	007	014	I will be his father, and he shall be my son:
2 Samuel	007	015	but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took
2 Samuel	007	016	Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you:
2 Samuel	007	017	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
2 Samuel	007	018	Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
2 Samuel	007	019	This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have
2 Samuel	007	020	What can David say more to you? for you know your servant,
2 Samuel	007	021	For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you
2 Samuel	007	022	Therefore you are great, Yahweh God:  for there is none like you,
2 Samuel	007	023	What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel,
2 Samuel	007	024	You did establish to yourself your people Israel to be a people
2 Samuel	007	025	Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning
2 Samuel	007	026	Let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies
2 Samuel	007	027	For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed
2 Samuel	007	028	Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth,
2 Samuel	007	029	now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant,
2 Samuel	008	001	After this it happened that David struck the Philistines,
2 Samuel	008	002	He struck Moab, and measured them with the line,
2 Samuel	008	003	David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
2 Samuel	008	004	David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty
2 Samuel	008	005	When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king
2 Samuel	008	006	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the
2 Samuel	008	007	David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
2 Samuel	008	008	From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
2 Samuel	008	009	When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all
2 Samuel	008	010	then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to Greet him,
2 Samuel	008	011	These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
2 Samuel	008	012	of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
2 Samuel	008	013	David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians
2 Samuel	008	014	He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
2 Samuel	008	015	David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice
2 Samuel	008	016	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
2 Samuel	008	017	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
2 Samuel	008	018	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites
2 Samuel	009	001	David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul,
2 Samuel	009	002	There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba,
2 Samuel	009	003	The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
2 Samuel	009	004	The king said to him, Where is he?  Ziba said to the king,
2 Samuel	009	005	Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir
2 Samuel	009	006	Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
2 Samuel	009	007	David said to him, "Don't be afraid of him; for I will
2 Samuel	009	008	He did obeisance, and said, "What is your servant, that you
2 Samuel	009	009	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him,
2 Samuel	009	010	You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons,
2 Samuel	009	011	Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord
2 Samuel	009	012	Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica.
2 Samuel	009	013	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually
2 Samuel	010	001	It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died,
2 Samuel	010	002	David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,
2 Samuel	010	003	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun
2 Samuel	010	004	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half
2 Samuel	010	005	When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men
2 Samuel	010	006	When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious
2 Samuel	010	007	When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
2 Samuel	010	008	The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
2 Samuel	010	009	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
2 Samuel	010	010	The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
2 Samuel	010	011	He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
2 Samuel	010	012	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
2 Samuel	010	013	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle
2 Samuel	010	014	When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
2 Samuel	010	015	When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
2 Samuel	010	016	Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond
2 Samuel	010	017	It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
2 Samuel	010	018	The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
2 Samuel	010	019	When all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
2 Samuel	011	001	It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go
2 Samuel	011	002	It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed,
2 Samuel	011	003	David send and inquired after the woman.  One said,
2 Samuel	011	004	David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him,
2 Samuel	011	005	The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said,
2 Samuel	011	006	David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite.
2 Samuel	011	007	When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did,
2 Samuel	011	008	David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet.
2 Samuel	011	009	But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all
2 Samuel	011	010	When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn't go down to his house,
2 Samuel	011	011	Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
2 Samuel	011	012	David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I
2 Samuel	011	013	When David had called him, he ate and drink before him;
2 Samuel	011	014	It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab,
2 Samuel	011	015	He wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront
2 Samuel	011	016	It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned
2 Samuel	011	017	The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab:
2 Samuel	011	018	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel	011	019	and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end
2 Samuel	011	020	it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he tells you,
2 Samuel	011	021	who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  Didn't a woman
2 Samuel	011	022	So the messenger went, and came and shown David all that Joab
2 Samuel	011	023	The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us,
2 Samuel	011	024	The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall;
2 Samuel	011	025	Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don't let
2 Samuel	011	026	When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
2 Samuel	011	027	When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home
2 Samuel	012	001	Yahweh sent Nathan to David.  He came to him, and said
2 Samuel	012	002	The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
2 Samuel	012	003	but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb,
2 Samuel	012	004	A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his
2 Samuel	012	005	David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said
2 Samuel	012	006	He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
2 Samuel	012	007	Nathan said to David, "You are the man.  This is what Yahweh,
2 Samuel	012	008	I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into
2 Samuel	012	009	Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which
2 Samuel	012	010	Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house,
2 Samuel	012	011	This is what Yahweh says:  'Behold, I will raise up evil
2 Samuel	012	012	For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel,
2 Samuel	012	013	David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh."
2 Samuel	012	014	However, because by this deed you have given great occasion
2 Samuel	012	015	Nathan departed to his house.  Yahweh struck the child that
2 Samuel	012	016	David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted,
2 Samuel	012	017	The elders of his house arose, [and stood] beside him,
2 Samuel	012	018	It happened on the seventh day, that the child died.
2 Samuel	012	019	But when David saw that his servants were whispering together,
2 Samuel	012	020	Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
2 Samuel	012	021	Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that you have
2 Samuel	012	022	He said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
2 Samuel	012	023	But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again?
2 Samuel	012	024	David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay
2 Samuel	012	025	and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named
2 Samuel	012	026	Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
2 Samuel	012	027	Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
2 Samuel	012	028	Now therefore gather the rest of the people together,
2 Samuel	012	029	David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
2 Samuel	012	030	He took the crown of their king from off his head;
2 Samuel	012	031	He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them
2 Samuel	013	001	It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had
2 Samuel	013	002	Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar;
2 Samuel	013	003	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son
2 Samuel	013	004	He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day
2 Samuel	013	005	Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign
2 Samuel	013	006	So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick:  and when the king
2 Samuel	013	007	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother
2 Samuel	013	008	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.
2 Samuel	013	009	She took the pan, and poured them out before him;
2 Samuel	013	010	Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may
2 Samuel	013	011	When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her,
2 Samuel	013	012	She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such
2 Samuel	013	013	I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be
2 Samuel	013	014	However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger
2 Samuel	013	015	Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred
2 Samuel	013	016	She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting
2 Samuel	013	017	Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said,
2 Samuel	013	018	She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such
2 Samuel	013	019	Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various
2 Samuel	013	020	Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother
2 Samuel	013	021	But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
2 Samuel	013	022	Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom
2 Samuel	013	023	It happened after two full years, that Absalom had
2 Samuel	013	024	Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant
2 Samuel	013	025	The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go,
2 Samuel	013	026	Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.
2 Samuel	013	027	But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's
2 Samuel	013	028	Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now,
2 Samuel	013	029	The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
2 Samuel	013	030	It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came
2 Samuel	013	031	Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth;
2 Samuel	013	032	Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Don't let
2 Samuel	013	033	Now therefore don't let my lord the king take the thing
2 Samuel	013	034	But Absalom fled.  The young man who kept the watch lifted up
2 Samuel	013	035	Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come:
2 Samuel	013	036	It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold,
2 Samuel	013	037	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur,
2 Samuel	013	038	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2 Samuel	013	039	[the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom:
2 Samuel	014	001	Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
2 Samuel	014	002	Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman,
2 Samuel	014	003	and go in to the king, and speak on this manner to him.
2 Samuel	014	004	When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face
2 Samuel	014	005	The king said to her, What ails you?  She answered, Of a truth
2 Samuel	014	006	Your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field,
2 Samuel	014	007	Behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid,
2 Samuel	014	008	The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give
2 Samuel	014	009	The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king,
2 Samuel	014	010	The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me,
2 Samuel	014	011	Then said she, Please let the king remember Yahweh your God,
2 Samuel	014	012	Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word
2 Samuel	014	013	The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against
2 Samuel	014	014	For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground,
2 Samuel	014	015	Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my
2 Samuel	014	016	For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand
2 Samuel	014	017	Then your handmaid said, Please let the word of my lord the king
2 Samuel	014	018	Then the king answered the woman, Please don't hide anything
2 Samuel	014	019	The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?
2 Samuel	014	020	to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done
2 Samuel	014	021	The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
2 Samuel	014	022	Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance,
2 Samuel	014	023	So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel	014	024	The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him
2 Samuel	014	025	Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
2 Samuel	014	026	When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end
2 Samuel	014	027	To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
2 Samuel	014	028	Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn't see
2 Samuel	014	029	Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king;
2 Samuel	014	030	Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is
2 Samuel	014	031	Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said
2 Samuel	014	032	Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here,
2 Samuel	014	033	So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called
2 Samuel	015	001	It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot
2 Samuel	015	002	Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
2 Samuel	015	003	Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right;
2 Samuel	015	004	Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
2 Samuel	015	005	It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance,
2 Samuel	015	006	In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the king
2 Samuel	015	007	It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said
2 Samuel	015	008	For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
2 Samuel	015	009	The king said to him, Go in peace.  So he arose, and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel	015	010	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
2 Samuel	015	011	With Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited,
2 Samuel	015	012	Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor,
2 Samuel	015	013	There came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
2 Samuel	015	014	David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise,
2 Samuel	015	015	The king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants
2 Samuel	015	016	The king went forth, and all his household after him.
2 Samuel	015	017	The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they
2 Samuel	015	018	All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
2 Samuel	015	019	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with
2 Samuel	015	020	Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go
2 Samuel	015	021	Ittai answered the king, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my
2 Samuel	015	022	David said to Ittai, Go and pass over.  Ittai the Gittite
2 Samuel	015	023	All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
2 Samuel	015	024	Behold, Zadok also [came], and all the Levites with him,
2 Samuel	015	025	The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city:
2 Samuel	015	026	but if he say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I,
2 Samuel	015	027	The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer?
2 Samuel	015	028	Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word
2 Samuel	015	029	Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again
2 Samuel	015	030	David went up by the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept
2 Samuel	015	031	One told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
2 Samuel	015	032	It happened that when David had come to the top [of the ascent],
2 Samuel	015	033	David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be
2 Samuel	015	034	but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be
2 Samuel	015	035	Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you?
2 Samuel	015	036	Behold, they have there with them their two sons,
2 Samuel	015	037	So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom
2 Samuel	016	001	When David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold,
2 Samuel	016	002	The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these?
2 Samuel	016	003	The king said, Where is your master's son?  Ziba said
2 Samuel	016	004	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains
2 Samuel	016	005	When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of
2 Samuel	016	006	He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
2 Samuel	016	007	Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man
2 Samuel	016	008	Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul,
2 Samuel	016	009	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king,
2 Samuel	016	010	The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons
2 Samuel	016	011	David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,
2 Samuel	016	012	It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me,
2 Samuel	016	013	So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along
2 Samuel	016	014	The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary;
2 Samuel	016	015	Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
2 Samuel	016	016	It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come
2 Samuel	016	017	Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend?
2 Samuel	016	018	Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people,
2 Samuel	016	019	Again, whom should I serve?  Shouldn't I serve in the presence
2 Samuel	016	020	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what
2 Samuel	016	021	Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines,
2 Samuel	016	022	So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house;
2 Samuel	016	023	The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days,
2 Samuel	017	001	Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose
2 Samuel	017	002	and I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will
2 Samuel	017	003	and I will bring back all the people to you:  the man whom
2 Samuel	017	004	The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel	017	005	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
2 Samuel	017	006	When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him,
2 Samuel	017	007	Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given
2 Samuel	017	008	Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men,
2 Samuel	017	009	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place:
2 Samuel	017	010	Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
2 Samuel	017	011	But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you,
2 Samuel	017	012	So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found,
2 Samuel	017	013	Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
2 Samuel	017	014	Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
2 Samuel	017	015	Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
2 Samuel	017	016	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don't lodge
2 Samuel	017	017	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female
2 Samuel	017	018	But a boy saw them, and told Absalom:  and they went both of them
2 Samuel	017	019	The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth,
2 Samuel	017	020	Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said,
2 Samuel	017	021	It happened, after they had departed, that they came up
2 Samuel	017	022	Then David arose, and all the people who were with him,
2 Samuel	017	023	When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
2 Samuel	017	024	Then David came to Mahanaim.  Absalom passed over the Jordan,
2 Samuel	017	025	Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab.
2 Samuel	017	026	Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel	017	027	It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
2 Samuel	017	028	brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
2 Samuel	017	029	and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd,
2 Samuel	018	001	David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains
2 Samuel	018	002	David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand
2 Samuel	018	003	But the people said, You shall not go forth:  for if we flee away,
2 Samuel	018	004	The king said to them, What seems you best I will do.
2 Samuel	018	005	The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
2 Samuel	018	006	So the people went out into the field against Israel:
2 Samuel	018	007	The people of Israel were struck there before the servants
2 Samuel	018	008	For the battle was there spread over the surface of all
2 Samuel	018	009	Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.
2 Samuel	018	010	A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
2 Samuel	018	011	Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it,
2 Samuel	018	012	The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
2 Samuel	018	013	Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there
2 Samuel	018	014	Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you.  He took three darts
2 Samuel	018	015	Ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and
2 Samuel	018	016	Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
2 Samuel	018	017	They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest,
2 Samuel	018	018	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up
2 Samuel	018	019	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
2 Samuel	018	020	Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day,
2 Samuel	018	021	Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen.
2 Samuel	018	022	Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come
2 Samuel	018	023	But come what may, [said he], I will run.  He said to him, Run.
2 Samuel	018	024	Now David was sitting between the two gates:  and the watchman
2 Samuel	018	025	The watchman cried, and told the king.  The king said,
2 Samuel	018	026	The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called
2 Samuel	018	027	The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is
2 Samuel	018	028	Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well.
2 Samuel	018	029	The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?
2 Samuel	018	030	The king said, Turn aside, and stand here.  He turned aside,
2 Samuel	018	031	Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my
2 Samuel	018	032	The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young
2 Samuel	018	033	The king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,
2 Samuel	019	001	It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
2 Samuel	019	002	The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people;
2 Samuel	019	003	The people got them by stealth that day into the city,
2 Samuel	019	004	The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
2 Samuel	019	005	Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed
2 Samuel	019	006	in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you.
2 Samuel	019	007	Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably
2 Samuel	019	008	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate.  They told to all
2 Samuel	019	009	All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
2 Samuel	019	010	Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
2 Samuel	019	011	King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
2 Samuel	019	012	You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh:
2 Samuel	019	013	Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh?
2 Samuel	019	014	He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of]
2 Samuel	019	015	So the king returned, and came to the Jordan.  Judah came to Gilgal,
2 Samuel	019	016	Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim,
2 Samuel	019	017	There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
2 Samuel	019	018	A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household,
2 Samuel	019	019	He said to the king, Don't let my lord impute iniquity to me,
2 Samuel	019	020	For your servant does know that I have sinned:  therefore, behold,
2 Samuel	019	021	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be
2 Samuel	019	022	David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah,
2 Samuel	019	023	The king said to Shimei, You shall not die.  The king
2 Samuel	019	024	Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king;
2 Samuel	019	025	It happened, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
2 Samuel	019	026	He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
2 Samuel	019	027	He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord
2 Samuel	019	028	For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king;
2 Samuel	019	029	The king said to him, Why speak you any more of your matters?
2 Samuel	019	030	Mephibosheth said to the king, yes, let him take all,
2 Samuel	019	031	Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went
2 Samuel	019	032	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old:
2 Samuel	019	033	The king said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I
2 Samuel	019	034	Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years
2 Samuel	019	035	I am this day eighty years old:  can I discern between good
2 Samuel	019	036	Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king:
2 Samuel	019	037	Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die
2 Samuel	019	038	The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me,
2 Samuel	019	039	All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over:
2 Samuel	019	040	So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him:
2 Samuel	019	041	Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king,
2 Samuel	019	042	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
2 Samuel	019	043	The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
2 Samuel	020	001	There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba,
2 Samuel	020	002	So all the men of Israel went up from following David,
2 Samuel	020	003	David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
2 Samuel	020	004	Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together
2 Samuel	020	005	So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed
2 Samuel	020	006	David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us
2 Samuel	020	007	There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites
2 Samuel	020	008	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came
2 Samuel	020	009	Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother?
2 Samuel	020	010	But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
2 Samuel	020	011	There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who
2 Samuel	020	012	Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway.
2 Samuel	020	013	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
2 Samuel	020	014	He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah,
2 Samuel	020	015	They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast
2 Samuel	020	016	Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear!
2 Samuel	020	017	He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?  He answered,
2 Samuel	020	018	Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in
2 Samuel	020	019	I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
2 Samuel	020	020	Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should
2 Samuel	020	021	The matter is not so:  but a man of the hill country
2 Samuel	020	022	Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom.
2 Samuel	020	023	Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son
2 Samuel	020	024	and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor;
2 Samuel	020	025	and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
2 Samuel	020	026	and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
2 Samuel	021	001	There was a famine in the days of David three years,
2 Samuel	021	002	The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites
2 Samuel	021	003	and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
2 Samuel	021	004	The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold
2 Samuel	021	005	They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised
2 Samuel	021	006	let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang
2 Samuel	021	007	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
2 Samuel	021	008	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
2 Samuel	021	009	He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
2 Samuel	021	010	Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
2 Samuel	021	011	It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine
2 Samuel	021	012	David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
2 Samuel	021	013	and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones
2 Samuel	021	014	They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country
2 Samuel	021	015	The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down,
2 Samuel	021	016	and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight
2 Samuel	021	017	But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck
2 Samuel	021	018	It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the
2 Samuel	021	019	There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan
2 Samuel	021	020	There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
2 Samuel	021	021	When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother,
2 Samuel	021	022	These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell
2 Samuel	022	001	David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day
2 Samuel	022	002	and he said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
2 Samuel	022	003	God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield,
2 Samuel	022	004	I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
2 Samuel	022	005	For the waves of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
2 Samuel	022	006	The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death caught me.
2 Samuel	022	007	In my distress I called on Yahweh.  Yes, I called to my God.
2 Samuel	022	008	Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations of heaven
2 Samuel	022	009	Smoke went up out of his nostrils.  Fire out of his mouth devoured.
2 Samuel	022	010	He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
2 Samuel	022	011	He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he was seen on the wings
2 Samuel	022	012	He made darkness pavilions around himself:  gathering of waters,
2 Samuel	022	013	At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel	022	014	Yahweh thundered from heaven.  The Most High uttered his voice.
2 Samuel	022	015	He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
2 Samuel	022	016	Then the channels of the sea appeared.  The foundations of
2 Samuel	022	017	He sent from on high and he took me.  He drew me out
2 Samuel	022	018	He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me,
2 Samuel	022	019	They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
2 Samuel	022	020	He also brought me out into a large place.  He delivered me,
2 Samuel	022	021	Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.
2 Samuel	022	022	For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
2 Samuel	022	023	For all his ordinances were before me.  As for his statutes,
2 Samuel	022	024	I was also perfect toward him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
2 Samuel	022	025	Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
2 Samuel	022	026	With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
2 Samuel	022	027	With the pure you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
2 Samuel	022	028	You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on
2 Samuel	022	029	For you are my lamp, Yahweh.  Yahweh will light up my darkness.
2 Samuel	022	030	For by you, I run against a troop.  By my God, I leap over a wall.
2 Samuel	022	031	As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tested.
2 Samuel	022	032	For who is God, besides Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God?
2 Samuel	022	033	God is my strong fortress.  He makes my way perfect.
2 Samuel	022	034	He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], and sets me on
2 Samuel	022	035	He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
2 Samuel	022	036	You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
2 Samuel	022	037	You have enlarged my steps under me.  My feet have not slipped.
2 Samuel	022	038	I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.  I didn't turn
2 Samuel	022	039	I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they
2 Samuel	022	040	For you have armed me with strength for the battle.
2 Samuel	022	041	You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
2 Samuel	022	042	They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
2 Samuel	022	043	Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.
2 Samuel	022	044	You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.
2 Samuel	022	045	The foreigners will submit themselves to me.  As soon as they
2 Samuel	022	046	The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out
2 Samuel	022	047	Yahweh lives!  Blessed be my rock!  Exalted be God, the rock
2 Samuel	022	048	even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down
2 Samuel	022	049	who brings me away from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up
2 Samuel	022	050	Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
2 Samuel	022	051	He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
2 Samuel	023	001	Now these are the last words of David.  David the son of Jesse says,
2 Samuel	023	002	The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me.  His word was on my tongue.
2 Samuel	023	003	The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
2 Samuel	023	004	[He shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,
2 Samuel	023	005	Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet he has made
2 Samuel	023	006	But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,
2 Samuel	023	007	But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and
2 Samuel	023	008	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:
2 Samuel	023	009	After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite,
2 Samuel	023	010	He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary,
2 Samuel	023	011	After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite.
2 Samuel	023	012	But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it,
2 Samuel	023	013	Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David
2 Samuel	023	014	David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the
2 Samuel	023	015	David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink
2 Samuel	023	016	The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines,
2 Samuel	023	017	He said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this:
2 Samuel	023	018	Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
2 Samuel	023	019	Wasn't he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made
2 Samuel	023	020	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
2 Samuel	023	021	He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man:  and the Egyptian had
2 Samuel	023	022	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name
2 Samuel	023	023	He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn't attain
2 Samuel	023	024	Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son
2 Samuel	023	025	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
2 Samuel	023	026	Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
2 Samuel	023	027	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2 Samuel	023	028	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
2 Samuel	023	029	Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai
2 Samuel	023	030	Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
2 Samuel	023	031	Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2 Samuel	023	032	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
2 Samuel	023	033	Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
2 Samuel	023	034	Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam
2 Samuel	023	035	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
2 Samuel	023	036	Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
2 Samuel	023	037	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers
2 Samuel	023	038	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
2 Samuel	023	039	Uriah the Hittite:  thirty-seven in all.
2 Samuel	024	001	Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved
2 Samuel	024	002	The king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him,
2 Samuel	024	003	Joab said to the king, Now Yahweh your God add to the people,
2 Samuel	024	004	Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab,
2 Samuel	024	005	They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right
2 Samuel	024	006	then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi;
2 Samuel	024	007	and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities
2 Samuel	024	008	So when they had gone back and forth through all the land,
2 Samuel	024	009	Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king:
2 Samuel	024	010	David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people.
2 Samuel	024	011	When David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came
2 Samuel	024	012	Go and speak to David, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things:
2 Samuel	024	013	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven
2 Samuel	024	014	David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let us fall
2 Samuel	024	015	So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even
2 Samuel	024	016	When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem
2 Samuel	024	017	David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who struck the people,
2 Samuel	024	018	Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar
2 Samuel	024	019	David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
2 Samuel	024	020	Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming
2 Samuel	024	021	Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant?
2 Samuel	024	022	Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
2 Samuel	024	023	all this, king, does Araunah give to the king.  Araunah said
2 Samuel	024	024	The king said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly
2 Samuel	024	025	David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
1 Kings	001	001	Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
1 Kings	001	002	Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for
1 Kings	001	003	So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all
1 Kings	001	004	The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king,
1 Kings	001	005	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
1 Kings	001	006	His father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
1 Kings	001	007	He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
1 Kings	001	008	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
1 Kings	001	009	Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone
1 Kings	001	010	but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men,
1 Kings	001	011	Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
1 Kings	001	012	Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you
1 Kings	001	013	Go and get you in to king David, and tell him, Didn't you,
1 Kings	001	014	Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will
1 Kings	001	015	Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber:  and the king
1 Kings	001	016	Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king.  The king said,
1 Kings	001	017	She said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God
1 Kings	001	018	Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king,
1 Kings	001	019	and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
1 Kings	001	020	You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,
1 Kings	001	021	Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall
1 Kings	001	022	Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
1 Kings	001	023	They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet.
1 Kings	001	024	Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, Adonijah shall
1 Kings	001	025	For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings
1 Kings	001	026	But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest,
1 Kings	001	027	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown
1 Kings	001	028	Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba.
1 Kings	001	029	The king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed
1 Kings	001	030	most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel,
1 Kings	001	031	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance
1 Kings	001	032	King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
1 Kings	001	033	The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
1 Kings	001	034	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
1 Kings	001	035	Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit
1 Kings	001	036	Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,
1 Kings	001	037	As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so be
1 Kings	001	038	So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah
1 Kings	001	039	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent,
1 Kings	001	040	All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
1 Kings	001	041	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they
1 Kings	001	042	While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
1 Kings	001	043	Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David
1 Kings	001	044	and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest,
1 Kings	001	045	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
1 Kings	001	046	Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings	001	047	Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord
1 Kings	001	048	Also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,
1 Kings	001	049	All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went
1 Kings	001	050	Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went,
1 Kings	001	051	It was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon;
1 Kings	001	052	Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall
1 Kings	001	053	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
1 Kings	002	001	Now the days of David drew near that he should die;
1 Kings	002	002	I am going the way of all the earth:  be you strong therefore,
1 Kings	002	003	and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways,
1 Kings	002	004	That Yahweh may establish his word which he spoke concerning me,
1 Kings	002	005	Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
1 Kings	002	006	Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let his gray
1 Kings	002	007	But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
1 Kings	002	008	Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite,
1 Kings	002	009	Now therefore don't hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man;
1 Kings	002	010	David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings	002	011	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years;
1 Kings	002	012	Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
1 Kings	002	013	Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba
1 Kings	002	014	He said moreover, I have somewhat to tell you.
1 Kings	002	015	He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all
1 Kings	002	016	Now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me.  She said
1 Kings	002	017	He said, "Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell
1 Kings	002	018	Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
1 Kings	002	019	Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him
1 Kings	002	020	Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me.
1 Kings	002	021	She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
1 Kings	002	022	King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag
1 Kings	002	023	Then king Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me,
1 Kings	002	024	Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me,
1 Kings	002	025	King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell
1 Kings	002	026	To Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth,
1 Kings	002	027	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh,
1 Kings	002	028	The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
1 Kings	002	029	It was told king Solomon, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh,
1 Kings	002	030	Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, Thus says
1 Kings	002	031	The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him,
1 Kings	002	032	Yahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell
1 Kings	002	033	So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on
1 Kings	002	034	Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him,
1 Kings	002	035	The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army;
1 Kings	002	036	The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him,
1 Kings	002	037	For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron,
1 Kings	002	038	Shimei said to the king, The saying is good:
1 Kings	002	039	It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants
1 Kings	002	040	Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish,
1 Kings	002	041	It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
1 Kings	002	042	The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Didn't I
1 Kings	002	043	Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment
1 Kings	002	044	The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness
1 Kings	002	045	But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
1 Kings	002	046	So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
1 Kings	003	001	Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
1 Kings	003	002	Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there
1 Kings	003	003	Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David his father:
1 Kings	003	004	The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
1 Kings	003	005	In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night;
1 Kings	003	006	Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father
1 Kings	003	007	Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead
1 Kings	003	008	Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen,
1 Kings	003	009	Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge
1 Kings	003	010	The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1 Kings	003	011	God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have
1 Kings	003	012	behold, I have done according to your word:  behold, I have
1 Kings	003	013	I have also given you that which you have not asked,
1 Kings	003	014	If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments,
1 Kings	003	015	Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream:  and he came
1 Kings	003	016	Then there came two women who were prostitutes, to the king,
1 Kings	003	017	The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
1 Kings	003	018	It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this
1 Kings	003	019	This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it.
1 Kings	003	020	She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
1 Kings	003	021	When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead;
1 Kings	003	022	The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead
1 Kings	003	023	Then said the king, The one says, This is my son who lives,
1 Kings	003	024	The king said, Get me a sword.  They brought a sword
1 Kings	003	025	The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
1 Kings	003	026	Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king,
1 Kings	003	027	Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no
1 Kings	003	028	All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
1 Kings	004	001	King Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings	004	002	These were the princes whom he had:  Azariah the son
1 Kings	004	003	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the
1 Kings	004	004	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok
1 Kings	004	005	and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud
1 Kings	004	006	and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son
1 Kings	004	007	Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided
1 Kings	004	008	These are their names:  Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
1 Kings	004	009	Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh,
1 Kings	004	010	Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him [pertained] Socoh, and all
1 Kings	004	011	Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath
1 Kings	004	012	Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all
1 Kings	004	013	Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him [pertained] the towns
1 Kings	004	014	Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1 Kings	004	015	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter
1 Kings	004	016	Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
1 Kings	004	017	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1 Kings	004	018	Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
1 Kings	004	019	Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country
1 Kings	004	020	Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea
1 Kings	004	021	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to
1 Kings	004	022	Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour,
1 Kings	004	023	ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and one
1 Kings	004	024	For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the River,
1 Kings	004	025	Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine
1 Kings	004	026	Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
1 Kings	004	027	Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all
1 Kings	004	028	Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought
1 Kings	004	029	God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
1 Kings	004	030	Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
1 Kings	004	031	For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite,
1 Kings	004	032	He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were
1 Kings	004	033	He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to
1 Kings	004	034	There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
1 Kings	005	001	Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard
1 Kings	005	002	Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1 Kings	005	003	You know how that David my father could not build a house
1 Kings	005	004	But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side;
1 Kings	005	005	Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh
1 Kings	005	006	Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
1 Kings	005	007	It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
1 Kings	005	008	Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard [the message]
1 Kings	005	009	My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea;
1 Kings	005	010	So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir
1 Kings	005	011	Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
1 Kings	005	012	Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there
1 Kings	005	013	King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
1 Kings	005	014	He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses;
1 Kings	005	015	Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty
1 Kings	005	016	besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work,
1 Kings	005	017	The king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones,
1 Kings	005	018	Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites
1 Kings	006	001	It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after
1 Kings	006	002	The house which king Solomon built for Yahweh, the length of it
1 Kings	006	003	The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
1 Kings	006	004	For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work.
1 Kings	006	005	Against the wall of the house he built stories round about,
1 Kings	006	006	The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle
1 Kings	006	007	The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
1 Kings	006	008	The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side
1 Kings	006	009	So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house
1 Kings	006	010	He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high:
1 Kings	006	011	The word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying,
1 Kings	006	012	Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk
1 Kings	006	013	I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
1 Kings	006	014	So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1 Kings	006	015	He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar:
1 Kings	006	016	He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house
1 Kings	006	017	The house, that is, the temple before [the oracle],
1 Kings	006	018	There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and
1 Kings	006	019	He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within,
1 Kings	006	020	Within the oracle was [a space of] twenty cubits in length,
1 Kings	006	021	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold:
1 Kings	006	022	The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house
1 Kings	006	023	In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood,
1 Kings	006	024	Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
1 Kings	006	025	The other cherub was ten cubits:  both the cherubim were of one
1 Kings	006	026	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it
1 Kings	006	027	He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings
1 Kings	006	028	He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings	006	029	He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
1 Kings	006	030	The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
1 Kings	006	031	For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood:
1 Kings	006	032	So [he made] two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them
1 Kings	006	033	So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts
1 Kings	006	034	and two doors of fir wood:  the two leaves of the one door
1 Kings	006	035	He carved [thereon] cherubim and palm trees and open flowers;
1 Kings	006	036	He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone,
1 Kings	006	037	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid,
1 Kings	006	038	In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month,
1 Kings	007	001	Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
1 Kings	007	002	For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it
1 Kings	007	003	It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams,
1 Kings	007	004	There were beams in three rows, and window was over against
1 Kings	007	005	All the doors and posts were made square with beams:
1 Kings	007	006	He made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits,
1 Kings	007	007	He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge,
1 Kings	007	008	His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch,
1 Kings	007	009	All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone,
1 Kings	007	010	The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
1 Kings	007	011	Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure,
1 Kings	007	012	The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone,
1 Kings	007	013	King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings	007	014	He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
1 Kings	007	015	For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits
1 Kings	007	016	He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of
1 Kings	007	017	There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work,
1 Kings	007	018	So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on
1 Kings	007	019	The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch
1 Kings	007	020	There were capitals above also on the two pillars,
1 Kings	007	021	He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple:
1 Kings	007	022	On the top of the pillars was lily work:  so was the work
1 Kings	007	023	He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
1 Kings	007	024	Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did
1 Kings	007	025	It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
1 Kings	007	026	It was a handbreadth thick:  and the brim of it was worked
1 Kings	007	027	He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length
1 Kings	007	028	The work of the bases was on this manner:  they had panels;
1 Kings	007	029	and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen,
1 Kings	007	030	Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass;
1 Kings	007	031	The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit:
1 Kings	007	032	The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles
1 Kings	007	033	The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
1 Kings	007	034	There were four supports at the four corners of each base:
1 Kings	007	035	In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high;
1 Kings	007	036	On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it,
1 Kings	007	037	After this manner he made the ten bases:  all of them had
1 Kings	007	038	He made ten basins of brass:  one basin contained forty baths;
1 Kings	007	039	He set the bases, five on the right side of the house,
1 Kings	007	040	Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins.
1 Kings	007	041	the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on
1 Kings	007	042	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
1 Kings	007	043	and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;
1 Kings	007	044	and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
1 Kings	007	045	and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins:
1 Kings	007	046	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
1 Kings	007	047	Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were
1 Kings	007	048	Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh:
1 Kings	007	049	and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left,
1 Kings	007	050	and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons,
1 Kings	007	051	Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house
1 Kings	008	001	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
1 Kings	008	002	All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at
1 Kings	008	003	All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1 Kings	008	004	They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting,
1 Kings	008	005	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled
1 Kings	008	006	The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
1 Kings	008	007	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
1 Kings	008	008	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from
1 Kings	008	009	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone
1 Kings	008	010	It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
1 Kings	008	011	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
1 Kings	008	012	Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
1 Kings	008	013	I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you
1 Kings	008	014	The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly
1 Kings	008	015	He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
1 Kings	008	016	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out
1 Kings	008	017	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
1 Kings	008	018	But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
1 Kings	008	019	nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
1 Kings	008	020	Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
1 Kings	008	021	There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant
1 Kings	008	022	Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
1 Kings	008	023	and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
1 Kings	008	024	who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
1 Kings	008	025	Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
1 Kings	008	026	Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified,
1 Kings	008	027	But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold,
1 Kings	008	028	Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for
1 Kings	008	029	that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
1 Kings	008	030	Listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your
1 Kings	008	031	If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him
1 Kings	008	032	then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
1 Kings	008	033	When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy,
1 Kings	008	034	then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
1 Kings	008	035	When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
1 Kings	008	036	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
1 Kings	008	037	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
1 Kings	008	038	whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
1 Kings	008	039	then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive,
1 Kings	008	040	that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land
1 Kings	008	041	Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
1 Kings	008	042	(for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand,
1 Kings	008	043	hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all
1 Kings	008	044	If your people go out to battle against their enemy,
1 Kings	008	045	then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
1 Kings	008	046	If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
1 Kings	008	047	yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
1 Kings	008	048	if they return to you with all their heart and with all their
1 Kings	008	049	then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven,
1 Kings	008	050	and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their
1 Kings	008	051	(for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought
1 Kings	008	052	that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant,
1 Kings	008	053	For you did separate them from among all the peoples of the earth,
1 Kings	008	054	It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
1 Kings	008	055	He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a
1 Kings	008	056	Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel,
1 Kings	008	057	Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers:
1 Kings	008	058	that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways,
1 Kings	008	059	Let these my words, with which I have made supplication
1 Kings	008	060	that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God;
1 Kings	008	061	Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God,
1 Kings	008	062	The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
1 Kings	008	063	Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,
1 Kings	008	064	The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy
1 Kings	008	065	So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him,
1 Kings	008	066	On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed
1 Kings	009	001	It happened, when Solomon had finished the building of the house
1 Kings	009	002	that Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
1 Kings	009	003	Yahweh said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication,
1 Kings	009	004	As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked,
1 Kings	009	005	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever,
1 Kings	009	006	But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children,
1 Kings	009	007	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
1 Kings	009	008	Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes
1 Kings	009	009	and they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God,
1 Kings	009	010	It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
1 Kings	009	011	(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
1 Kings	009	012	Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
1 Kings	009	013	He said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?
1 Kings	009	014	Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.
1 Kings	009	015	This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised,
1 Kings	009	016	Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
1 Kings	009	017	Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,
1 Kings	009	018	and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
1 Kings	009	019	and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities
1 Kings	009	020	As for all the people who were left of the Amorites,
1 Kings	009	021	their children who were left after them in the land,
1 Kings	009	022	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants;
1 Kings	009	023	These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work,
1 Kings	009	024	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David
1 Kings	009	025	Three times a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
1 Kings	009	026	King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is
1 Kings	009	027	Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge
1 Kings	009	028	They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred
1 Kings	010	001	When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
1 Kings	010	002	She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
1 Kings	010	003	Solomon told her all her questions:  there was not anything
1 Kings	010	004	When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon,
1 Kings	010	005	and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
1 Kings	010	006	She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
1 Kings	010	007	However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my
1 Kings	010	008	Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand
1 Kings	010	009	Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
1 Kings	010	010	She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold,
1 Kings	010	011	The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
1 Kings	010	012	The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh,
1 Kings	010	013	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
1 Kings	010	014	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
1 Kings	010	015	besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic
1 Kings	010	016	King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
1 Kings	010	017	[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas
1 Kings	010	018	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
1 Kings	010	019	There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was
1 Kings	010	020	Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
1 Kings	010	021	All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
1 Kings	010	022	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram:
1 Kings	010	023	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches
1 Kings	010	024	All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom,
1 Kings	010	025	They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
1 Kings	010	026	Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen:
1 Kings	010	027	The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
1 Kings	010	028	The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt;
1 Kings	010	029	A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
1 Kings	011	001	Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter
1 Kings	011	002	of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children
1 Kings	011	003	He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines;
1 Kings	011	004	For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
1 Kings	011	005	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,
1 Kings	011	006	Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
1 Kings	011	007	Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination
1 Kings	011	008	So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and
1 Kings	011	009	Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away
1 Kings	011	010	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
1 Kings	011	011	Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you,
1 Kings	011	012	Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David
1 Kings	011	013	However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will
1 Kings	011	014	Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
1 Kings	011	015	For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain
1 Kings	011	016	(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had
1 Kings	011	017	that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
1 Kings	011	018	They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men
1 Kings	011	019	Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
1 Kings	011	020	The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
1 Kings	011	021	When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
1 Kings	011	022	Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me,
1 Kings	011	023	God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada,
1 Kings	011	024	He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop,
1 Kings	011	025	He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
1 Kings	011	026	Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah,
1 Kings	011	027	This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king:
1 Kings	011	028	The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw
1 Kings	011	029	It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
1 Kings	011	030	Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore
1 Kings	011	031	He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh,
1 Kings	011	032	(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake
1 Kings	011	033	because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped
1 Kings	011	034	However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand;
1 Kings	011	035	but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
1 Kings	011	036	To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
1 Kings	011	037	I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your
1 Kings	011	038	It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you,
1 Kings	011	039	I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.
1 Kings	011	040	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose,
1 Kings	011	041	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,
1 Kings	011	042	The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
1 Kings	011	043	Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
1 Kings	012	001	Rehoboam went to Shechem:  for all Israel were come to Shechem
1 Kings	012	002	It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it
1 Kings	012	003	and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly
1 Kings	012	004	Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
1 Kings	012	005	He said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.
1 Kings	012	006	King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
1 Kings	012	007	They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this
1 Kings	012	008	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
1 Kings	012	009	He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer
1 Kings	012	010	The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
1 Kings	012	011	Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
1 Kings	012	012	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
1 Kings	012	013	The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel
1 Kings	012	014	and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
1 Kings	012	015	So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing
1 Kings	012	016	When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
1 Kings	012	017	But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
1 Kings	012	018	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject
1 Kings	012	019	So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings	012	020	It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned,
1 Kings	012	021	When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
1 Kings	012	022	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1 Kings	012	023	Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
1 Kings	012	024	Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your
1 Kings	012	025	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,
1 Kings	012	026	Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return
1 Kings	012	027	if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house
1 Kings	012	028	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold;
1 Kings	012	029	He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
1 Kings	012	030	This thing became a sin; for the people went [to worship]
1 Kings	012	031	He made houses of high places, and made priests from among
1 Kings	012	032	Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
1 Kings	012	033	He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on
1 Kings	013	001	Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
1 Kings	013	002	He cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said,
1 Kings	013	003	He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
1 Kings	013	004	It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God,
1 Kings	013	005	The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
1 Kings	013	006	The king answered the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh
1 Kings	013	007	The king said to the man of God, Come home with me,
1 Kings	013	008	The man of God said to the king, If you will give me half
1 Kings	013	009	for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall
1 Kings	013	010	So he went another way, and didn't return by the way that
1 Kings	013	011	Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons
1 Kings	013	012	Their father said to them, Which way did he go?
1 Kings	013	013	He said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey.  So they saddled
1 Kings	013	014	He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak;
1 Kings	013	015	Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1 Kings	013	016	He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you;
1 Kings	013	017	for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no
1 Kings	013	018	He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel
1 Kings	013	019	So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house,
1 Kings	013	020	It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh
1 Kings	013	021	and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying,
1 Kings	013	022	but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place
1 Kings	013	023	It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
1 Kings	013	024	When he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him:
1 Kings	013	025	Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way,
1 Kings	013	026	When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it,
1 Kings	013	027	He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey.
1 Kings	013	028	He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey
1 Kings	013	029	The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it
1 Kings	013	030	He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
1 Kings	013	031	It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons,
1 Kings	013	032	For the saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against
1 Kings	013	033	After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from his evil way, but made
1 Kings	013	034	This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off,
1 Kings	014	001	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1 Kings	014	002	Jeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself,
1 Kings	014	003	Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey,
1 Kings	014	004	Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh,
1 Kings	014	005	Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes
1 Kings	014	006	It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
1 Kings	014	007	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Because I
1 Kings	014	008	and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you;
1 Kings	014	009	but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone
1 Kings	014	010	therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam,
1 Kings	014	011	Him who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
1 Kings	014	012	Arise you therefore, get you to your house:  [and] when your
1 Kings	014	013	All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only
1 Kings	014	014	Moreover Yahweh will raise him up a king over Israel,
1 Kings	014	015	For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water;
1 Kings	014	016	He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
1 Kings	014	017	Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
1 Kings	014	018	All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word
1 Kings	014	019	The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
1 Kings	014	020	The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
1 Kings	014	021	Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was
1 Kings	014	022	Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they
1 Kings	014	023	For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim,
1 Kings	014	024	and there were also sodomites in the land:  they did according
1 Kings	014	025	It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
1 Kings	014	026	and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
1 Kings	014	027	King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
1 Kings	014	028	It was so, that as often as the king went into the house
1 Kings	014	029	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
1 Kings	014	030	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings	014	031	Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
1 Kings	015	001	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
1 Kings	015	002	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's name
1 Kings	015	003	He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
1 Kings	015	004	Nevertheless for David's sake did Yahweh his God give
1 Kings	015	005	because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
1 Kings	015	006	Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
1 Kings	015	007	The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
1 Kings	015	008	Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city
1 Kings	015	009	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa
1 Kings	015	010	Forty-one years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
1 Kings	015	011	Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did
1 Kings	015	012	He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
1 Kings	015	013	Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen,
1 Kings	015	014	But the high places were not taken away:  nevertheless the heart
1 Kings	015	015	He brought into the house of Yahweh the things that his father
1 Kings	015	016	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings	015	017	Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
1 Kings	015	018	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left
1 Kings	015	019	[There is] a league between me and you, between my father and
1 Kings	015	020	Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of
1 Kings	015	021	It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
1 Kings	015	022	Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted:
1 Kings	015	023	Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might,
1 Kings	015	024	Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
1 Kings	015	025	Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
1 Kings	015	026	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
1 Kings	015	027	Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
1 Kings	015	028	Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha kill him,
1 Kings	015	029	It happened that, as soon as he was king, he struck all the house
1 Kings	015	030	for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which
1 Kings	015	031	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
1 Kings	015	032	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings	015	033	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha
1 Kings	015	034	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
1 Kings	016	001	The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the son of Hanani
1 Kings	016	002	Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over
1 Kings	016	003	behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house;
1 Kings	016	004	Him who dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat;
1 Kings	016	005	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did,
1 Kings	016	006	Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah;
1 Kings	016	007	Moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
1 Kings	016	008	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah began
1 Kings	016	009	His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
1 Kings	016	010	and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him,
1 Kings	016	011	It happened, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
1 Kings	016	012	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word
1 Kings	016	013	for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
1 Kings	016	014	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren't they
1 Kings	016	015	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
1 Kings	016	016	The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired,
1 Kings	016	017	Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him,
1 Kings	016	018	It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
1 Kings	016	019	for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil
1 Kings	016	020	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he did,
1 Kings	016	021	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts:
1 Kings	016	022	But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people
1 Kings	016	023	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
1 Kings	016	024	He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver;
1 Kings	016	025	Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt
1 Kings	016	026	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
1 Kings	016	027	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
1 Kings	016	028	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria;
1 Kings	016	029	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
1 Kings	016	030	Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight
1 Kings	016	031	It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
1 Kings	016	032	He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
1 Kings	016	033	Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh,
1 Kings	016	034	In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho:  he laid
1 Kings	017	001	Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead,
1 Kings	017	002	The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
1 Kings	017	003	Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself
1 Kings	017	004	It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have
1 Kings	017	005	So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went
1 Kings	017	006	The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
1 Kings	017	007	It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there
1 Kings	017	008	The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,
1 Kings	017	009	Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon,
1 Kings	017	010	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate
1 Kings	017	011	As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said,
1 Kings	017	012	She said, As Yahweh your God lives, I don't have a cake,
1 Kings	017	013	Elijah said to her, Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said;
1 Kings	017	014	For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall
1 Kings	017	015	She went and did according to the saying of Elijah:
1 Kings	017	016	The jar of meal didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail,
1 Kings	017	017	It happened after these things, that the son of the woman,
1 Kings	017	018	She said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you man
1 Kings	017	019	He said to her, Give me your son.  He took him out of her bosom,
1 Kings	017	020	He cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, have you also brought
1 Kings	017	021	He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh,
1 Kings	017	022	Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
1 Kings	017	023	Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
1 Kings	017	024	The woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God,
1 Kings	018	001	It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came
1 Kings	018	002	Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.  The famine was
1 Kings	018	003	Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household.
1 Kings	018	004	for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh,
1 Kings	018	005	Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs
1 Kings	018	006	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
1 Kings	018	007	As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him:
1 Kings	018	008	He answered him, It is I:  go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is
1 Kings	018	009	He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your
1 Kings	018	010	As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom,
1 Kings	018	011	Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].
1 Kings	018	012	It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit
1 Kings	018	013	Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets
1 Kings	018	014	Now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah [is here];
1 Kings	018	015	Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
1 Kings	018	016	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went
1 Kings	018	017	It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,
1 Kings	018	018	He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your
1 Kings	018	019	Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel,
1 Kings	018	020	So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered
1 Kings	018	021	Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you
1 Kings	018	022	Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet
1 Kings	018	023	Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull
1 Kings	018	024	You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name
1 Kings	018	025	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull
1 Kings	018	026	They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it,
1 Kings	018	027	It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud;
1 Kings	018	028	They cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
1 Kings	018	029	It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until
1 Kings	018	030	Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all
1 Kings	018	031	Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
1 Kings	018	032	With the stones he built an altar in the name of Yahweh;
1 Kings	018	033	He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces,
1 Kings	018	034	He said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time.
1 Kings	018	035	The water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
1 Kings	018	036	It happened at the time of the offering of the [evening] offering,
1 Kings	018	037	Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know
1 Kings	018	038	Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering,
1 Kings	018	039	When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces:
1 Kings	018	040	and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don't let
1 Kings	018	041	Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there
1 Kings	018	042	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink.  Elijah went up to the top
1 Kings	018	043	He said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.
1 Kings	018	044	It happened at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold,
1 Kings	018	045	It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black
1 Kings	018	046	and the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and he girded up his waist,
1 Kings	019	001	Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had
1 Kings	019	002	Then Jezebel send a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let
1 Kings	019	003	When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
1 Kings	019	004	But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came
1 Kings	019	005	He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold,
1 Kings	019	006	He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked
1 Kings	019	007	The angel of Yahweh came again the second time, and touched him,
1 Kings	019	008	He arose, and ate and drink, and went in the strength of that
1 Kings	019	009	He came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold,
1 Kings	019	010	He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
1 Kings	019	011	He said, Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.
1 Kings	019	012	and after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire:
1 Kings	019	013	It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
1 Kings	019	014	He said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies;
1 Kings	019	015	Yahweh said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness
1 Kings	019	016	and Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel;
1 Kings	019	017	It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael
1 Kings	019	018	Yet will I leave [me] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
1 Kings	019	019	So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
1 Kings	019	020	He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you,
1 Kings	019	021	He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen,
1 Kings	020	001	Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together;
1 Kings	020	002	He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city,
1 Kings	020	003	Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children,
1 Kings	020	004	The king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying,
1 Kings	020	005	The messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad,
1 Kings	020	006	but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time,
1 Kings	020	007	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
1 Kings	020	008	All the elders and all the people said to him, Don't you
1 Kings	020	009	Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my
1 Kings	020	010	Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me,
1 Kings	020	011	The king of Israel answered, Tell him, Don't let him who girds
1 Kings	020	012	It happened, when [Ben Hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking,
1 Kings	020	013	Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said,
1 Kings	020	014	Ahab said, By whom?  He said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young
1 Kings	020	015	Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
1 Kings	020	016	They went out at noon.  But Ben Hadad was drinking himself
1 Kings	020	017	The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
1 Kings	020	018	He said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive,
1 Kings	020	019	So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes
1 Kings	020	020	They killed everyone his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel
1 Kings	020	021	The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots,
1 Kings	020	022	The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him,
1 Kings	020	023	The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is
1 Kings	020	024	Do this thing:  take the kings away, every man out of his place,
1 Kings	020	025	and number you an army, like the army that you have lost,
1 Kings	020	026	It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered
1 Kings	020	027	The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned,
1 Kings	020	028	A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel,
1 Kings	020	029	They encamped one over against the other seven days.
1 Kings	020	030	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell
1 Kings	020	031	His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that
1 Kings	020	032	So they girded sackcloth on their bodies, and [put] ropes
1 Kings	020	033	Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether
1 Kings	020	034	[Ben Hadad] said to him, The cities which my father took
1 Kings	020	035	A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow
1 Kings	020	036	Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice
1 Kings	020	037	Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me.
1 Kings	020	038	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
1 Kings	020	039	As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said,
1 Kings	020	040	As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.
1 Kings	020	041	He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes;
1 Kings	020	042	He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go
1 Kings	020	043	The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry,
1 Kings	021	001	It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
1 Kings	021	002	Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may
1 Kings	021	003	Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give
1 Kings	021	004	Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word
1 Kings	021	005	But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your
1 Kings	021	006	He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,
1 Kings	021	007	Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom
1 Kings	021	008	So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal,
1 Kings	021	009	She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
1 Kings	021	010	and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them
1 Kings	021	011	The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived
1 Kings	021	012	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1 Kings	021	013	The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him:
1 Kings	021	014	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned,
1 Kings	021	015	It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
1 Kings	021	016	It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
1 Kings	021	017	The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings	021	018	Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria:
1 Kings	021	019	You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you
1 Kings	021	020	Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy?
1 Kings	021	021	Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you
1 Kings	021	022	and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son
1 Kings	021	023	Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat
1 Kings	021	024	Him who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat;
1 Kings	021	025	(But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do
1 Kings	021	026	He did very abominably in following idols, according to
1 Kings	021	027	It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes,
1 Kings	021	028	The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings	021	029	See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles
1 Kings	022	001	They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings	022	002	It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
1 Kings	022	003	The king of Israel said to his servants, "You know that
1 Kings	022	004	He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to
1 Kings	022	005	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first
1 Kings	022	006	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together,
1 Kings	022	007	But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides,
1 Kings	022	008	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man
1 Kings	022	009	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly
1 Kings	022	010	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
1 Kings	022	011	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said,
1 Kings	022	012	All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead,
1 Kings	022	013	The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now,
1 Kings	022	014	Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me,
1 Kings	022	015	When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah,
1 Kings	022	016	The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you
1 Kings	022	017	He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep
1 Kings	022	018	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you
1 Kings	022	019	[Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh:  I saw
1 Kings	022	020	Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up
1 Kings	022	021	There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said,
1 Kings	022	022	Yahweh said to him, 'How?'  He said, 'I will go forth,
1 Kings	022	023	Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in
1 Kings	022	024	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah
1 Kings	022	025	Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you
1 Kings	022	026	The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
1 Kings	022	027	and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
1 Kings	022	028	Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not
1 Kings	022	029	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
1 Kings	022	030	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
1 Kings	022	031	Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains
1 Kings	022	032	It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
1 Kings	022	033	It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was
1 Kings	022	034	A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck
1 Kings	022	035	The battle increased that day:  and the king was stayed
1 Kings	022	036	There went a cry throughout the army about the going down
1 Kings	022	037	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
1 Kings	022	038	They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked
1 Kings	022	039	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did,
1 Kings	022	040	So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned
1 Kings	022	041	Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth
1 Kings	022	042	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign;
1 Kings	022	043	He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He didn't turn aside
1 Kings	022	044	Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings	022	045	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that
1 Kings	022	046	The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his
1 Kings	022	047	There was no king in Edom:  a deputy was king.
1 Kings	022	048	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold:
1 Kings	022	049	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
1 Kings	022	050	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
1 Kings	022	051	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
1 Kings	022	052	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked
1 Kings	022	053	He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh,
2 Kings	001	001	Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings	001	002	Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber
2 Kings	001	003	But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up
2 Kings	001	004	Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You shall not come down
2 Kings	001	005	The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it
2 Kings	001	006	They said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said
2 Kings	001	007	He said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you,
2 Kings	001	008	They answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a belt
2 Kings	001	009	Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
2 Kings	001	010	Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God,
2 Kings	001	011	Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty.
2 Kings	001	012	Elijah answered them, If I be a man of God, let fire come
2 Kings	001	013	Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty.
2 Kings	001	014	Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former
2 Kings	001	015	The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him:
2 Kings	001	016	He said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have sent messengers
2 Kings	001	017	So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken.
2 Kings	001	018	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren't they
2 Kings	002	001	It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind
2 Kings	002	002	Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for Yahweh has
2 Kings	002	003	The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha,
2 Kings	002	004	Elijah said to him, Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent
2 Kings	002	005	The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha,
2 Kings	002	006	Elijah said to him, "Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent
2 Kings	002	007	Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over
2 Kings	002	008	Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck
2 Kings	002	009	It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said
2 Kings	002	010	He said, You have asked a hard thing:  [nevertheless], if you
2 Kings	002	011	It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold,
2 Kings	002	012	Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots
2 Kings	002	013	He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him,
2 Kings	002	014	He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck
2 Kings	002	015	When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him
2 Kings	002	016	They said to him, See now, there are with your servants
2 Kings	002	017	When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send.
2 Kings	002	018	They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said
2 Kings	002	019	The men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you,
2 Kings	002	020	He said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt therein.
2 Kings	002	021	He went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein,
2 Kings	002	022	So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word
2 Kings	002	023	He went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up
2 Kings	002	024	He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name
2 Kings	002	025	He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there
2 Kings	003	001	Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
2 Kings	003	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like
2 Kings	003	003	Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
2 Kings	003	004	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered
2 Kings	003	005	But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
2 Kings	003	006	King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time,
2 Kings	003	007	He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
2 Kings	003	008	He said, Which way shall we go up?  He answered, The way
2 Kings	003	009	So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king
2 Kings	003	010	The king of Israel said, Alas! for Yahweh has called these
2 Kings	003	011	But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh,
2 Kings	003	012	Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him.
2 Kings	003	013	Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you?
2 Kings	003	014	Elisha said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand,
2 Kings	003	015	But now bring me a minstrel.  It happened, when the minstrel played,
2 Kings	003	016	He said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.
2 Kings	003	017	For thus says Yahweh, You shall not see wind, neither shall you
2 Kings	003	018	This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh:
2 Kings	003	019	You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city,
2 Kings	003	020	It happened in the morning, about the time of offering
2 Kings	003	021	Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up
2 Kings	003	022	They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water,
2 Kings	003	023	and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed,
2 Kings	003	024	When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
2 Kings	003	025	They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they
2 Kings	003	026	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe
2 Kings	003	027	Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place,
2 Kings	004	001	Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons
2 Kings	004	002	Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me;
2 Kings	004	003	Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors,
2 Kings	004	004	You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons,
2 Kings	004	005	So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons;
2 Kings	004	006	It happened, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son,
2 Kings	004	007	Then she came and told the man of God.  He said, Go, sell the oil,
2 Kings	004	008	It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
2 Kings	004	009	She said to her husband, See now, I perceive that this is a holy
2 Kings	004	010	Let us make, Please, a little chamber on the wall;
2 Kings	004	011	It fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into
2 Kings	004	012	He said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite.
2 Kings	004	013	He said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful
2 Kings	004	014	He said, What then is to be done for her?  Gehazi answered,
2 Kings	004	015	He said, Call her.  When he had called her, she stood in the door.
2 Kings	004	016	He said, At this season, when the time comes round, you shall
2 Kings	004	017	The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time
2 Kings	004	018	When the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out
2 Kings	004	019	He said to his father, My head, my head.  He said to his servant,
2 Kings	004	020	When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat
2 Kings	004	021	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
2 Kings	004	022	She called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of
2 Kings	004	023	He said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon
2 Kings	004	024	Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive,
2 Kings	004	025	So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel.
2 Kings	004	026	please run now to meet her, and ask her, Is it well with you?
2 Kings	004	027	When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold
2 Kings	004	028	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord?  Didn't I say,
2 Kings	004	029	Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your waist, and take my
2 Kings	004	030	The mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your
2 Kings	004	031	Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face
2 Kings	004	032	When Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,
2 Kings	004	033	He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both,
2 Kings	004	034	He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth,
2 Kings	004	035	Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth;
2 Kings	004	036	He called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite.
2 Kings	004	037	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself
2 Kings	004	038	Elisha came again to Gilgal.  There was a dearth in the land;
2 Kings	004	039	One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine,
2 Kings	004	040	So they poured out for the men to eat.  It happened,
2 Kings	004	041	But he said, Then bring meal.  He cast it into the pot;
2 Kings	004	042	There came a man from Baal Shalishah, and brought the man
2 Kings	004	043	His servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men?
2 Kings	004	044	So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it,
2 Kings	005	001	Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria,
2 Kings	005	002	The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive
2 Kings	005	003	She said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet
2 Kings	005	004	One went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
2 Kings	005	005	The king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter
2 Kings	005	006	He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this
2 Kings	005	007	It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
2 Kings	005	008	It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king
2 Kings	005	009	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots,
2 Kings	005	010	Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the
2 Kings	005	011	But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
2 Kings	005	012	Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than
2 Kings	005	013	His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said,
2 Kings	005	014	Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times
2 Kings	005	015	He returned to the man of God, he and all his company,
2 Kings	005	016	But he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will
2 Kings	005	017	Naaman said, If not, yet, please let there be given to your servant
2 Kings	005	018	In this thing Yahweh pardon your servant:  when my master
2 Kings	005	019	He said to him, Go in peace.  So he departed from him
2 Kings	005	020	But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,
2 Kings	005	021	So Gehazi followed after Naaman.  When Naaman saw one running
2 Kings	005	022	He said, All is well.  My master has sent me, saying, Behold,
2 Kings	005	023	Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents.  He urged him,
2 Kings	005	024	When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand,
2 Kings	005	025	But he went in, and stood before his master.  Elisha said to him,
2 Kings	005	026	He said to him, Didn't my heart go with you, when the man turned
2 Kings	005	027	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you,
2 Kings	006	001	The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place
2 Kings	006	002	Let us go, we pray you, to the Jordan, and take there every man
2 Kings	006	003	One said, Be pleased, I pray you, to go with your servants.
2 Kings	006	004	So he went with them.  When they came to the Jordan,
2 Kings	006	005	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water;
2 Kings	006	006	The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?"  He showed him the place.
2 Kings	006	007	He said, "Take it."  So he put out his hand and took it.
2 Kings	006	008	Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took
2 Kings	006	009	The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you
2 Kings	006	010	The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
2 Kings	006	011	The heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing;
2 Kings	006	012	One of his servants said, No, my lord, O king; but Elisha,
2 Kings	006	013	He said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.
2 Kings	006	014	Therefore sent he there horses, and chariots, and a great army:
2 Kings	006	015	When the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth,
2 Kings	006	016	He answered, Don't be afraid; for those who are with us are
2 Kings	006	017	Elisha prayed, and said, Yahweh, Please open his eyes,
2 Kings	006	018	When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh,
2 Kings	006	019	Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city:
2 Kings	006	020	It happened, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said,
2 Kings	006	021	The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father,
2 Kings	006	022	He answered, You shall not strike them:  would you strike those
2 Kings	006	023	He prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten
2 Kings	006	024	It happened after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered
2 Kings	006	025	There was a great famine in Samaria:  and behold, they besieged it,
2 Kings	006	026	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried
2 Kings	006	027	He said, If Yahweh doesn't help you, whence shall I help you?
2 Kings	006	028	The king said to her, What ails you?  She answered, This woman
2 Kings	006	029	So we boiled my son, and ate him:  and I said to her on the next day,
2 Kings	006	030	It happened, when the king heard the words of the woman,
2 Kings	006	031	Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head
2 Kings	006	032	But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were
2 Kings	006	033	While he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came
2 Kings	007	001	Elisha said, Hear you the word of Yahweh:  thus says
2 Kings	007	002	Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man
2 Kings	007	003	Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate:
2 Kings	007	004	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is
2 Kings	007	005	They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians;
2 Kings	007	006	For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise
2 Kings	007	007	Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents,
2 Kings	007	008	When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp,
2 Kings	007	009	Then they said one to another, We aren't doing right.
2 Kings	007	010	So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they
2 Kings	007	011	He called the porters; and they told it to the king's
2 Kings	007	012	The king arose in the night, and said to his servants,
2 Kings	007	013	One of his servants answered, Please let some take five
2 Kings	007	014	They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king
2 Kings	007	015	They went after them to the Jordan:  and behold, all the way
2 Kings	007	016	The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians.
2 Kings	007	017	The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have
2 Kings	007	018	It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying,
2 Kings	007	019	and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
2 Kings	007	020	it happened even so to him; for the people trod on him in the gate,
2 Kings	008	001	Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored
2 Kings	008	002	The woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God;
2 Kings	008	003	It happened at the seven years' end, that the woman returned
2 Kings	008	004	Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man
2 Kings	008	005	It happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life
2 Kings	008	006	When the king asked the woman, she told him.  So the king appointed
2 Kings	008	007	Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick;
2 Kings	008	008	The king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go,
2 Kings	008	009	So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him,
2 Kings	008	010	Elisha said to him, Go, tell him, You shall surely recover;
2 Kings	008	011	He settled his gaze steadfastly [on him], until he was ashamed:
2 Kings	008	012	Hazael said, Why weeps my lord?  He answered, Because I
2 Kings	008	013	Hazael said, But what is your servant, who is but a dog,
2 Kings	008	014	Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master;
2 Kings	008	015	It happened on the next day, that he took the coverlet, and dipped
2 Kings	008	016	In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king
2 Kings	008	017	Thirty-two years old was he when he began to reign;
2 Kings	008	018	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
2 Kings	008	019	However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David his
2 Kings	008	020	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah,
2 Kings	008	021	Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him:
2 Kings	008	022	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day.
2 Kings	008	023	The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren't they
2 Kings	008	024	Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
2 Kings	008	025	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
2 Kings	008	026	Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
2 Kings	008	027	He walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which
2 Kings	008	028	He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king
2 Kings	008	029	King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
2 Kings	009	001	Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets,
2 Kings	009	002	When you come there, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat
2 Kings	009	003	Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
2 Kings	009	004	So the young man, even the young man the prophet,
2 Kings	009	005	When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting;
2 Kings	009	006	He arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
2 Kings	009	007	You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may
2 Kings	009	008	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off
2 Kings	009	009	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son
2 Kings	009	010	The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there
2 Kings	009	011	Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord:
2 Kings	009	012	They said, It is false; tell us now.  He said, Thus and thus
2 Kings	009	013	Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it
2 Kings	009	014	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
2 Kings	009	015	but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of
2 Kings	009	016	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.
2 Kings	009	017	Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
2 Kings	009	018	So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says
2 Kings	009	019	Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them,
2 Kings	009	020	The watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and isn't
2 Kings	009	021	Joram said, Make ready.  They made ready his chariot.
2 Kings	009	022	It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
2 Kings	009	023	Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There
2 Kings	009	024	Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram
2 Kings	009	025	Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast
2 Kings	009	026	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood
2 Kings	009	027	But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
2 Kings	009	028	His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried
2 Kings	009	029	In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
2 Kings	009	030	When Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it;
2 Kings	009	031	As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, you Zimri,
2 Kings	009	032	He lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my
2 Kings	009	033	He said, Throw her down.  So they threw her down; and some
2 Kings	009	034	When he was come in, he ate and drink; and he said, See now to this
2 Kings	009	035	They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull,
2 Kings	009	036	Therefore they came back, and told him.  He said, This is
2 Kings	009	037	and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field
2 Kings	010	001	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.  Jehu wrote letters,
2 Kings	010	002	Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's
2 Kings	010	003	look you out the best and meet of your master's sons, and set
2 Kings	010	004	But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two
2 Kings	010	005	He who was over the household, and he who was over the city,
2 Kings	010	006	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying,
2 Kings	010	007	It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took
2 Kings	010	008	There came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought
2 Kings	010	009	It happened in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
2 Kings	010	010	Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word
2 Kings	010	011	So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
2 Kings	010	012	He arose and departed, and went to Samaria.  As he was at
2 Kings	010	013	Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
2 Kings	010	014	He said, Take them alive.  They took them alive, and killed
2 Kings	010	015	When he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son
2 Kings	010	016	He said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.
2 Kings	010	017	When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab
2 Kings	010	018	Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them,
2 Kings	010	019	Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal,
2 Kings	010	020	Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.
2 Kings	010	021	Jehu sent through all Israel:  and all the worshippers of
2 Kings	010	022	He said to him who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments
2 Kings	010	023	Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal;
2 Kings	010	024	They went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
2 Kings	010	025	It happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering
2 Kings	010	026	They brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal,
2 Kings	010	027	They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house
2 Kings	010	028	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings	010	029	However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
2 Kings	010	030	Yahweh said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing
2 Kings	010	031	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God
2 Kings	010	032	In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel:
2 Kings	010	033	from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites,
2 Kings	010	034	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
2 Kings	010	035	Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria.
2 Kings	010	036	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria
2 Kings	011	001	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
2 Kings	011	002	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
2 Kings	011	003	He was with her hid in the house of Yahweh six years.
2 Kings	011	004	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains
2 Kings	011	005	He commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do:
2 Kings	011	006	A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate
2 Kings	011	007	The two companies of you, even all who go forth on the Sabbath,
2 Kings	011	008	You shall compass the king round about, every man with his
2 Kings	011	009	The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada
2 Kings	011	010	The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears
2 Kings	011	011	The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
2 Kings	011	012	Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him,
2 Kings	011	013	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and of] the people,
2 Kings	011	014	and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar,
2 Kings	011	015	Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were
2 Kings	011	016	So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses'
2 Kings	011	017	Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king
2 Kings	011	018	All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke
2 Kings	011	019	He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites,
2 Kings	011	020	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet.
2 Kings	011	021	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings	012	001	In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign;
2 Kings	012	002	Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all
2 Kings	012	003	However the high places were not taken away; the people still
2 Kings	012	004	Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the holy things
2 Kings	012	005	let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance;
2 Kings	012	006	But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
2 Kings	012	007	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for
2 Kings	012	008	The priests consented that they should take no [more] money
2 Kings	012	009	But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole
2 Kings	012	010	It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest,
2 Kings	012	011	They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those
2 Kings	012	012	and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber
2 Kings	012	013	But there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups
2 Kings	012	014	for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired
2 Kings	012	015	Moreover they didn't demand an accounting from the men into whose
2 Kings	012	016	The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for
2 Kings	012	017	Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
2 Kings	012	018	Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat
2 Kings	012	019	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,
2 Kings	012	020	His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash
2 Kings	012	021	For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son
2 Kings	013	001	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah,
2 Kings	013	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed
2 Kings	013	003	The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered
2 Kings	013	004	Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him;
2 Kings	013	005	(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under
2 Kings	013	006	Nevertheless they didn't depart from the sins of the house
2 Kings	013	007	For he didn't leave to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen,
2 Kings	013	008	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did,
2 Kings	013	009	Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria:
2 Kings	013	010	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
2 Kings	013	011	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he didn't
2 Kings	013	012	Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,
2 Kings	013	013	Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne:
2 Kings	013	014	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died:
2 Kings	013	015	Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows; and he took to him
2 Kings	013	016	He said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow;
2 Kings	013	017	He said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it.
2 Kings	013	018	He said, Take the arrows; and he took them.  He said to the king
2 Kings	013	019	The man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have
2 Kings	013	020	Elisha died, and they buried him.  Now the bands of the Moabites
2 Kings	013	021	It happened, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied
2 Kings	013	022	Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings	013	023	But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them,
2 Kings	013	024	Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned
2 Kings	013	025	Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand
2 Kings	014	001	In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began
2 Kings	014	002	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	014	003	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not
2 Kings	014	004	However the high places were not taken away:  the people still
2 Kings	014	005	It happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand,
2 Kings	014	006	but the children of the murderers he didn't put to death;
2 Kings	014	007	He killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand,
2 Kings	014	008	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
2 Kings	014	009	Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
2 Kings	014	010	You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up:
2 Kings	014	011	But Amaziah would not hear.  So Jehoash king of Israel went up;
2 Kings	014	012	Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every
2 Kings	014	013	Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2 Kings	014	014	He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found
2 Kings	014	015	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,
2 Kings	014	016	Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
2 Kings	014	017	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2 Kings	014	018	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren't they written
2 Kings	014	019	They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem;
2 Kings	014	020	They brought him on horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem
2 Kings	014	021	All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old,
2 Kings	014	022	He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2 Kings	014	023	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
2 Kings	014	024	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh:
2 Kings	014	025	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath
2 Kings	014	026	For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter;
2 Kings	014	027	Yahweh didn't say that he would blot out the name of Israel
2 Kings	014	028	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did,
2 Kings	014	029	Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel;
2 Kings	015	001	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
2 Kings	015	002	Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned
2 Kings	015	003	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	015	004	However the high places were not taken away:  the people still
2 Kings	015	005	Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day
2 Kings	015	006	Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did,
2 Kings	015	007	Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
2 Kings	015	008	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah
2 Kings	015	009	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as his
2 Kings	015	010	Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him
2 Kings	015	011	Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written
2 Kings	015	012	This was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Your sons
2 Kings	015	013	Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
2 Kings	015	014	Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria,
2 Kings	015	015	Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
2 Kings	015	016	Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all who were therein,
2 Kings	015	017	In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
2 Kings	015	018	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh:
2 Kings	015	019	There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria;
2 Kings	015	020	Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty
2 Kings	015	021	Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,
2 Kings	015	022	Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned
2 Kings	015	023	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah
2 Kings	015	024	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh:
2 Kings	015	025	Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him,
2 Kings	015	026	Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
2 Kings	015	027	In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
2 Kings	015	028	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh:
2 Kings	015	029	In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath Pileser king
2 Kings	015	030	Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son
2 Kings	015	031	Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
2 Kings	015	032	In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
2 Kings	015	033	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	015	034	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh; he did
2 Kings	015	035	However the high places were not taken away:  the people
2 Kings	015	036	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did,
2 Kings	015	037	In those days Yahweh began to send against Judah Rezin the king
2 Kings	015	038	Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
2 Kings	016	001	In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz
2 Kings	016	002	Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign;
2 Kings	016	003	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made
2 Kings	016	004	He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2 Kings	016	005	Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
2 Kings	016	006	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria,
2 Kings	016	007	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria,
2 Kings	016	008	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
2 Kings	016	009	The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria
2 Kings	016	010	King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king
2 Kings	016	011	Urijah the priest built an altar:  according to all that king
2 Kings	016	012	When the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar:
2 Kings	016	013	He burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his
2 Kings	016	014	The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from
2 Kings	016	015	King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great altar
2 Kings	016	016	Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that
2 Kings	016	017	King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin
2 Kings	016	018	The covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house,
2 Kings	016	019	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren't they
2 Kings	016	020	Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
2 Kings	017	001	In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
2 Kings	017	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not
2 Kings	017	003	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
2 Kings	017	004	The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had
2 Kings	017	005	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land,
2 Kings	017	006	In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
2 Kings	017	007	It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against
2 Kings	017	008	and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out
2 Kings	017	009	The children of Israel did secretly things that were not
2 Kings	017	010	and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill,
2 Kings	017	011	and there they burnt incense in all the high places,
2 Kings	017	012	and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them,
2 Kings	017	013	Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet,
2 Kings	017	014	Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck,
2 Kings	017	015	They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with
2 Kings	017	016	They forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made
2 Kings	017	017	They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
2 Kings	017	018	Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed
2 Kings	017	019	Also Judah didn't keep the commandments of Yahweh their God,
2 Kings	017	020	Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them,
2 Kings	017	021	For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made
2 Kings	017	022	The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
2 Kings	017	023	until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke
2 Kings	017	024	The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah,
2 Kings	017	025	So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they
2 Kings	017	026	Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
2 Kings	017	027	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one
2 Kings	017	028	So one of the priests whom they had carried away from
2 Kings	017	029	However every nation made gods of their own, and put them
2 Kings	017	030	The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth
2 Kings	017	031	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites
2 Kings	017	032	So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves
2 Kings	017	033	They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner
2 Kings	017	034	To this day they do after the former manner:  they don't fear Yahweh,
2 Kings	017	035	with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and charged them, saying,
2 Kings	017	036	but Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
2 Kings	017	037	and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment,
2 Kings	017	038	and the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget;
2 Kings	017	039	but Yahweh your God shall you fear; and he will deliver you
2 Kings	017	040	However they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.
2 Kings	017	041	So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images;
2 Kings	018	001	Now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
2 Kings	018	002	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	018	003	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	018	004	He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut
2 Kings	018	005	He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him
2 Kings	018	006	For he joined with Yahweh; he didn't depart from following him,
2 Kings	018	007	Yahweh was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered:
2 Kings	018	008	He struck the Philistines to Gaza and the borders of it,
2 Kings	018	009	It happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was
2 Kings	018	010	At the end of three years they took it:  in the sixth year
2 Kings	018	011	The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria,
2 Kings	018	012	because they didn't obey the voice of Yahweh their God,
2 Kings	018	013	Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
2 Kings	018	014	Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria
2 Kings	018	015	Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house
2 Kings	018	016	At that time did Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors
2 Kings	018	017	The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
2 Kings	018	018	When they had called to the king, there came out to them
2 Kings	018	019	Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says
2 Kings	018	020	You say (but they are but vain words), [There is] counsel
2 Kings	018	021	Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed,
2 Kings	018	022	But if you tell me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn't that
2 Kings	018	023	Now therefore, Please give pledges to my master the king
2 Kings	018	024	How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least
2 Kings	018	025	Am I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it?
2 Kings	018	026	Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah,
2 Kings	018	027	But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master,
2 Kings	018	028	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
2 Kings	018	029	Thus says the king, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
2 Kings	018	030	neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will
2 Kings	018	031	Don't listen to Hezekiah:  for thus says the king
2 Kings	018	032	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
2 Kings	018	033	Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land
2 Kings	018	034	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
2 Kings	018	035	Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
2 Kings	018	036	But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word;
2 Kings	018	037	Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
2 Kings	019	001	It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore
2 Kings	019	002	He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
2 Kings	019	003	They said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble,
2 Kings	019	004	It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,
2 Kings	019	005	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings	019	006	Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you tell your master,
2 Kings	019	007	Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news,
2 Kings	019	008	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
2 Kings	019	009	When he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
2 Kings	019	010	Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don't let
2 Kings	019	011	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria
2 Kings	019	012	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers
2 Kings	019	013	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
2 Kings	019	014	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers,
2 Kings	019	015	Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, Yahweh, the God
2 Kings	019	016	Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see;
2 Kings	019	017	Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste
2 Kings	019	018	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods,
2 Kings	019	019	Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save you us, I beg you,
2 Kings	019	020	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
2 Kings	019	021	This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him:
2 Kings	019	022	Whom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you
2 Kings	019	023	By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said,
2 Kings	019	024	I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my
2 Kings	019	025	Haven't you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it
2 Kings	019	026	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
2 Kings	019	027	But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your
2 Kings	019	028	Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance is
2 Kings	019	029	This shall be the sign to you:  You shall eat this year
2 Kings	019	030	The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again
2 Kings	019	031	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out
2 Kings	019	032	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He shall
2 Kings	019	033	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return,
2 Kings	019	034	For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,
2 Kings	019	035	It happened that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth,
2 Kings	019	036	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
2 Kings	019	037	It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,
2 Kings	020	001	In those days was Hezekiah sick to death.  Isaiah the
2 Kings	020	002	Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,
2 Kings	020	003	Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you
2 Kings	020	004	It happened, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part
2 Kings	020	005	Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people,
2 Kings	020	006	I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver
2 Kings	020	007	Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs.  They took and laid it
2 Kings	020	008	Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Yahweh
2 Kings	020	009	Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh,
2 Kings	020	010	Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline
2 Kings	020	011	Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten
2 Kings	020	012	At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
2 Kings	020	013	Hezekiah listened to them, and shown them all the house of his
2 Kings	020	014	Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him,
2 Kings	020	015	He said, What have they seen in your house?  Hezekiah answered,
2 Kings	020	016	Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh.
2 Kings	020	017	Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house,
2 Kings	020	018	Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father,
2 Kings	020	019	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Yahweh
2 Kings	020	020	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might,
2 Kings	020	021	Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned
2 Kings	021	001	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	021	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
2 Kings	021	003	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
2 Kings	021	004	He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said,
2 Kings	021	005	He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts
2 Kings	021	006	He made his son to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery,
2 Kings	021	007	He set the engraved image of Asherah, that he had made,
2 Kings	021	008	neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out
2 Kings	021	009	But they didn't listen:  and Manasseh seduced them to do that
2 Kings	021	010	Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
2 Kings	021	011	Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations,
2 Kings	021	012	therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring
2 Kings	021	013	I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet
2 Kings	021	014	I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver
2 Kings	021	015	because they have done that which is evil in my sight,
2 Kings	021	016	Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had
2 Kings	021	017	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did,
2 Kings	021	018	Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden
2 Kings	021	019	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	021	020	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did
2 Kings	021	021	He walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served
2 Kings	021	022	and he forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn't walk
2 Kings	021	023	The servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king
2 Kings	021	024	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired
2 Kings	021	025	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, aren't they
2 Kings	021	026	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza:
2 Kings	022	001	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	022	002	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked
2 Kings	022	003	It happened in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king
2 Kings	022	004	Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money
2 Kings	022	005	and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have
2 Kings	022	006	to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons,
2 Kings	022	007	However there was no reckoning made with them of the money
2 Kings	022	008	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe,
2 Kings	022	009	Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
2 Kings	022	010	Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
2 Kings	022	011	It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book
2 Kings	022	012	The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
2 Kings	022	013	Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for
2 Kings	022	014	So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
2 Kings	022	015	She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Tell you
2 Kings	022	016	Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place,
2 Kings	022	017	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense
2 Kings	022	018	But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh,
2 Kings	022	019	because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself
2 Kings	022	020	Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you
2 Kings	023	001	The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah
2 Kings	023	002	The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah
2 Kings	023	003	The king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh,
2 Kings	023	004	The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
2 Kings	023	005	He put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah
2 Kings	023	006	He brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh,
2 Kings	023	007	He broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house
2 Kings	023	008	He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,
2 Kings	023	009	Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn't come up
2 Kings	023	010	He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
2 Kings	023	011	He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
2 Kings	023	012	The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz,
2 Kings	023	013	The high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
2 Kings	023	014	He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim,
2 Kings	023	015	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
2 Kings	023	016	As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there
2 Kings	023	017	Then he said, What monument is that which I see?
2 Kings	023	018	He said, Let him be; let no man move his bones.
2 Kings	023	019	All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities
2 Kings	023	020	He killed all the priests of the high places that were there,
2 Kings	023	021	The king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover
2 Kings	023	022	Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of
2 Kings	023	023	but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this Passover
2 Kings	023	024	Moreover those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards,
2 Kings	023	025	Like him was there no king before him, who turned to Yahweh with
2 Kings	023	026	Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn't turn from the fierceness of his
2 Kings	023	027	Yahweh said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I
2 Kings	023	028	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did,
2 Kings	023	029	In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king
2 Kings	023	030	His servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
2 Kings	023	031	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	023	032	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	023	033	Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
2 Kings	023	034	Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room
2 Kings	023	035	Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed
2 Kings	023	036	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	023	037	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	024	001	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up,
2 Kings	024	002	Yahweh sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands
2 Kings	024	003	Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah,
2 Kings	024	004	and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled
2 Kings	024	005	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
2 Kings	024	006	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son
2 Kings	024	007	The king of Egypt didn't come again out of his land any more;
2 Kings	024	008	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	024	009	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	024	010	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
2 Kings	024	011	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city, while his
2 Kings	024	012	and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon,
2 Kings	024	013	He carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
2 Kings	024	014	He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes,
2 Kings	024	015	He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king's mother,
2 Kings	024	016	All the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen
2 Kings	024	017	The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, [Jehoiachin's] father's brother,
2 Kings	024	018	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;
2 Kings	024	019	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
2 Kings	024	020	For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem
2 Kings	025	001	It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
2 Kings	025	002	So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings	025	003	On the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was sore
2 Kings	025	004	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war
2 Kings	025	005	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king,
2 Kings	025	006	Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king
2 Kings	025	007	They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out
2 Kings	025	008	Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month,
2 Kings	025	009	He burnt the house of Yahweh, and the king's house;
2 Kings	025	010	All the army of the Chaldeans, who were [with] the captain
2 Kings	025	011	The residue of the people who were left in the city,
2 Kings	025	012	But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land
2 Kings	025	013	The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh,
2 Kings	025	014	The pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,
2 Kings	025	015	The fire pans, and the basins, that which was of gold,
2 Kings	025	016	The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had
2 Kings	025	017	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital
2 Kings	025	018	The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
2 Kings	025	019	and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men
2 Kings	025	020	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
2 Kings	025	021	The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah
2 Kings	025	022	As for the people who were left in the land of Judah,
2 Kings	025	023	Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men,
2 Kings	025	024	Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them,
2 Kings	025	025	But it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
2 Kings	025	026	All the people, both small and great, and the captains of
2 Kings	025	027	It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
2 Kings	025	028	and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne
2 Kings	025	029	and changed his prison garments.  [Jehoiachin] ate bread
2 Kings	025	030	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him

1 Chronicles	014	011	So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there;
1 Chronicles	014	012	They left their gods there; and David gave commandment,
1 Chronicles	014	013	The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
1 Chronicles	014	014	David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall
1 Chronicles	014	015	It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops
1 Chronicles	014	016	David did as God commanded him:  and they struck the army
1 Chronicles	014	017	The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought
1 Chronicles	015	001	[David] made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared
1 Chronicles	015	002	Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites:
1 Chronicles	015	003	David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark
1 Chronicles	015	004	David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:
1 Chronicles	015	005	of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers

1 Chronicles	015	012	and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of
1 Chronicles	015	013	For because you didn't carry it at the first, Yahweh our God
1 Chronicles	015	014	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
1 Chronicles	015	015	The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their
1 Chronicles	015	016	David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers
1 Chronicles	015	017	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers,
1 Chronicles	015	018	and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben,
1 Chronicles	015	019	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed]

1 Chronicles	015	021	and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom,

1 Chronicles	015	024	Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai,
1 Chronicles	015	025	So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
1 Chronicles	015	026	It happened, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark
1 Chronicles	015	027	David was clothed with a robe of fine linen,
1 Chronicles	015	028	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant
1 Chronicles	015	029	It happened, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to
1 Chronicles	016	001	They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst
1 Chronicles	016	002	When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and
1 Chronicles	016	003	He dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman,
1 Chronicles	016	004	He appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark
1 Chronicles	016	005	Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth,
1 Chronicles	016	006	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually,
1 Chronicles	016	007	Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh,
1 Chronicles	016	008	Oh give thanks to Yahweh.  Call on his name.  Make his doings
1 Chronicles	016	009	Sing to him.  Sing praises to him.  Tell of all his marvelous works.
1 Chronicles	016	010	Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who

1 Chronicles	016	014	He is Yahweh our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
1 Chronicles	016	015	Remember his covenant forever, the word which he commanded
1 Chronicles	016	016	[the covenant] which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac.
1 Chronicles	016	017	He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, and to Israel
1 Chronicles	016	018	saying, I will you give the land of Canaan, The lot
1 Chronicles	016	019	when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few,
1 Chronicles	016	020	They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom
1 Chronicles	016	021	He allowed no man to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings
1 Chronicles	016	022	[saying], Don't touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm.
1 Chronicles	016	023	Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!  Display his salvation from
1 Chronicles	016	024	Declare his glory among the nations, and his marvelous works
1 Chronicles	016	025	For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised.
1 Chronicles	016	026	For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh
1 Chronicles	016	027	Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and gladness are

1 Chronicles	016	029	Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering,
1 Chronicles	016	030	Tremble before him, all the earth.  The world also is established
1 Chronicles	016	031	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice!
1 Chronicles	016	032	Let the sea roar, and its fullness!  Let the field exult,
1 Chronicles	016	033	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh,
1 Chronicles	016	034	Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
1 Chronicles	016	035	Say, Save us, God of our salvation!  Gather us together and
1 Chronicles	016	036	Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even
1 Chronicles	016	037	So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph
1 Chronicles	016	038	and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also
1 Chronicles	016	039	and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tent
1 Chronicles	016	040	to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering
1 Chronicles	016	041	and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen,
1 Chronicles	016	042	and with them Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals
1 Chronicles	016	043	All the people departed every man to his house:
1 Chronicles	017	001	It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said
1 Chronicles	017	002	Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God
1 Chronicles	017	003	It happened the same night, that the word of God came
1 Chronicles	017	004	Go and tell David my servant, Thus says Yahweh, You shall
1 Chronicles	017	005	for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought
1 Chronicles	017	006	In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, spoke I
1 Chronicles	017	007	Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says
1 Chronicles	017	008	and I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off
1 Chronicles	017	009	I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
1 Chronicles	017	010	and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over
1 Chronicles	017	011	It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go
1 Chronicles	017	012	He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
1 Chronicles	017	013	I will be his father, and he shall be my son:  and I will not
1 Chronicles	017	014	but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever;
1 Chronicles	017	015	According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
1 Chronicles	017	016	Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh;
1 Chronicles	017	017	This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have
1 Chronicles	017	018	What can David [say] yet more to you concerning the honor
1 Chronicles	017	019	Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart,
1 Chronicles	017	020	Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you,
1 Chronicles	017	021	What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel,
1 Chronicles	017	022	For your people Israel did you make your own people forever;
1 Chronicles	017	023	Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning
1 Chronicles	017	024	Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying,
1 Chronicles	017	025	For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will
1 Chronicles	017	026	Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing
1 Chronicles	017	027	and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant,
1 Chronicles	018	001	After this it happened, that David struck the Philistines,
1 Chronicles	018	002	He struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David,
1 Chronicles	018	003	David struck Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went
1 Chronicles	018	004	David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven
1 Chronicles	018	005	When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
1 Chronicles	018	006	Then David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus;
1 Chronicles	018	007	David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
1 Chronicles	018	008	From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took
1 Chronicles	018	009	When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army
1 Chronicles	018	010	he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him,
1 Chronicles	018	011	These also did king David dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver
1 Chronicles	018	012	Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites
1 Chronicles	018	013	He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants
1 Chronicles	018	014	David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and
1 Chronicles	018	015	Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat
1 Chronicles	018	016	and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
1 Chronicles	018	017	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites
1 Chronicles	019	001	It happened after this, that Nahash the king of the children
1 Chronicles	019	002	David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son
1 Chronicles	019	003	But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you
1 Chronicles	019	004	So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut
1 Chronicles	019	005	Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men
1 Chronicles	019	006	When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
1 Chronicles	019	007	So they hired them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king
1 Chronicles	019	008	When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army
1 Chronicles	019	009	The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
1 Chronicles	019	010	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him
1 Chronicles	019	011	The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai
1 Chronicles	019	012	He said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall
1 Chronicles	019	013	Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people,
1 Chronicles	019	014	So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before
1 Chronicles	019	015	When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
1 Chronicles	019	016	When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
1 Chronicles	019	017	It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together,
1 Chronicles	019	018	The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians
1 Chronicles	019	019	When the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse
1 Chronicles	020	001	It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time
1 Chronicles	020	002	David took the crown of their king from off his head,
1 Chronicles	020	003	He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut [them]
1 Chronicles	020	004	It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with
1 Chronicles	020	005	There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
1 Chronicles	020	006	There was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
1 Chronicles	020	007	When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
1 Chronicles	020	008	These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
1 Chronicles	021	001	Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles	021	002	David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go,
1 Chronicles	021	003	Joab said, Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many
1 Chronicles	021	004	Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab.
1 Chronicles	021	005	Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David.
1 Chronicles	021	006	But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's
1 Chronicles	021	007	God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.
1 Chronicles	021	008	David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done
1 Chronicles	021	009	Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
1 Chronicles	021	010	Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you
1 Chronicles	021	011	So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take
1 Chronicles	021	012	either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed
1 Chronicles	021	013	David said to Gad, I am in a great strait:  let me fall, I pray,
1 Chronicles	021	014	So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel
1 Chronicles	021	015	God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it:  and as he was
1 Chronicles	021	016	David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing
1 Chronicles	021	017	David said to God, Isn't it I who commanded the people
1 Chronicles	021	018	Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David, that David
1 Chronicles	021	019	David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the
1 Chronicles	021	020	Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were
1 Chronicles	021	021	As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
1 Chronicles	021	022	Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this
1 Chronicles	021	023	Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king
1 Chronicles	021	024	King David said to Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it
1 Chronicles	021	025	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels
1 Chronicles	021	026	David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings
1 Chronicles	021	027	Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
1 Chronicles	021	028	At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered
1 Chronicles	021	029	For the tent of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness,
1 Chronicles	021	030	But David couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for he was
1 Chronicles	022	001	Then David said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this
1 Chronicles	022	002	David commanded to gather together the foreigners who were
1 Chronicles	022	003	David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
1 Chronicles	022	004	and cedar trees without number:  for the Sidonians and they
1 Chronicles	022	005	David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
1 Chronicles	022	006	Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
1 Chronicles	022	007	David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart
1 Chronicles	022	008	But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed
1 Chronicles	022	009	Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest;
1 Chronicles	022	010	he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son,
1 Chronicles	022	011	Now, my son, Yahweh be with you; and prosper you, and build
1 Chronicles	022	012	May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put
1 Chronicles	022	013	Then shall you prosper, if you observe to do the statutes
1 Chronicles	022	014	Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house
1 Chronicles	022	015	There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers
1 Chronicles	022	016	of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
1 Chronicles	022	017	David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
1 Chronicles	022	018	Isn't Yahweh your God with you?  Hasn't he given you rest on
1 Chronicles	022	019	Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God;
1 Chronicles	023	001	Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son
1 Chronicles	023	002	He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests
1 Chronicles	023	003	The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward:
1 Chronicles	023	004	Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of
1 Chronicles	023	005	and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised
1 Chronicles	023	006	David divided them into divisions according to the sons

1 Chronicles	023	026	and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tent
1 Chronicles	023	027	For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered,
1 Chronicles	023	028	For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service
1 Chronicles	023	029	for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering,
1 Chronicles	023	030	and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh,

1 Chronicles	028	002	Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, Hear me,
1 Chronicles	028	003	But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name,
1 Chronicles	028	004	However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all
1 Chronicles	028	005	Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has
1 Chronicles	028	006	He said to me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house
1 Chronicles	028	007	I will establish his kingdom forever, if he be constant to do
1 Chronicles	028	008	Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh,
1 Chronicles	028	009	You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve
1 Chronicles	028	010	Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house
1 Chronicles	028	011	Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch [of
1 Chronicles	028	012	and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts
1 Chronicles	028	013	also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites,
1 Chronicles	028	014	of gold by weight for the [vessels of] gold, for all vessels
1 Chronicles	028	015	by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for the lamps of it,
1 Chronicles	028	016	and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table;
1 Chronicles	028	017	and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold;
1 Chronicles	028	018	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight;
1 Chronicles	028	019	All this, [said David], have I been made to understand in writing
1 Chronicles	028	020	David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage,
1 Chronicles	028	021	Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and
1 Chronicles	029	001	David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son,
1 Chronicles	029	002	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
1 Chronicles	029	003	In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God,
1 Chronicles	029	004	even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir,
1 Chronicles	029	005	of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things
1 Chronicles	029	006	Then the princes of the fathers' [houses], and the princes of the
1 Chronicles	029	007	and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
1 Chronicles	029	008	They with whom [precious] stones were found gave them
1 Chronicles	029	009	Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly,
1 Chronicles	029	010	Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly;
1 Chronicles	029	011	Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory,
1 Chronicles	029	012	Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all;
1 Chronicles	029	013	Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
1 Chronicles	029	014	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able
1 Chronicles	029	015	For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all
1 Chronicles	029	016	Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to
1 Chronicles	029	017	I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have
1 Chronicles	029	018	Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
1 Chronicles	029	019	and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments,
1 Chronicles	029	020	David said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh your God.
1 Chronicles	029	021	They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt
1 Chronicles	029	022	and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness.
1 Chronicles	029	023	Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David
1 Chronicles	029	024	All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons
1 Chronicles	029	025	Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel,
1 Chronicles	029	026	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles	029	027	The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
1 Chronicles	029	028	He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor:
1 Chronicles	029	029	Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
1 Chronicles	029	030	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him,
2 Chronicles	001	001	Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
2 Chronicles	001	002	Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands
2 Chronicles	001	003	So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place
2 Chronicles	001	004	But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim
2 Chronicles	001	005	Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri,
2 Chronicles	001	006	Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	001	007	In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him,
2 Chronicles	001	008	Solomon said to God, You have shown great loving kindness
2 Chronicles	001	009	Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established;
2 Chronicles	001	010	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
2 Chronicles	001	011	God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart,
2 Chronicles	001	012	wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches,
2 Chronicles	001	013	So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon,
2 Chronicles	001	014	Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen:  and he had one thousand
2 Chronicles	001	015	The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones,
2 Chronicles	001	016	The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue;
2 Chronicles	001	017	They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six
2 Chronicles	002	001	Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	002	002	Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens,
2 Chronicles	002	003	Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt
2 Chronicles	002	004	Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh
2 Chronicles	002	005	The house which I build is great; for great is our God
2 Chronicles	002	006	But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven
2 Chronicles	002	007	Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver,
2 Chronicles	002	008	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon;
2 Chronicles	002	009	even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I
2 Chronicles	002	010	Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber,
2 Chronicles	002	011	Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
2 Chronicles	002	012	Huram continued, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made
2 Chronicles	002	013	Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding,
2 Chronicles	002	014	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father
2 Chronicles	002	015	Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine,
2 Chronicles	002	016	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need;
2 Chronicles	002	017	Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land
2 Chronicles	002	018	He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty
2 Chronicles	003	001	Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem
2 Chronicles	003	002	He began to build in the second [day] of the second month,
2 Chronicles	003	003	Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building
2 Chronicles	003	004	The porch that was before [the house], the length of it,
2 Chronicles	003	005	The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood,
2 Chronicles	003	006	He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
2 Chronicles	003	007	He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds,
2 Chronicles	003	008	He made the most holy house:  the length of it, according to
2 Chronicles	003	009	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.
2 Chronicles	003	010	In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work;
2 Chronicles	003	011	The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long:
2 Chronicles	003	012	The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
2 Chronicles	003	013	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits:
2 Chronicles	003	014	He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen,
2 Chronicles	003	015	Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five
2 Chronicles	003	016	He made chains in the oracle, and put [them] on the tops
2 Chronicles	003	017	He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand,
2 Chronicles	004	001	Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
2 Chronicles	004	002	Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
2 Chronicles	004	003	Under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it
2 Chronicles	004	004	It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
2 Chronicles	004	005	It was a handbreadth thick; and the brim of it was worked
2 Chronicles	004	006	He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand,
2 Chronicles	004	007	He made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance
2 Chronicles	004	008	He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple,
2 Chronicles	004	009	Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
2 Chronicles	004	010	He set the sea on the right side [of the house] eastward,
2 Chronicles	004	011	Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins.
2 Chronicles	004	012	the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were
2 Chronicles	004	013	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks;
2 Chronicles	004	014	He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;
2 Chronicles	004	015	one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
2 Chronicles	004	016	The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all the vessels
2 Chronicles	004	017	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
2 Chronicles	004	018	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance:
2 Chronicles	004	019	Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God,
2 Chronicles	004	020	and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according
2 Chronicles	004	021	and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,
2 Chronicles	004	022	and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the
2 Chronicles	005	001	Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh
2 Chronicles	005	002	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all
2 Chronicles	005	003	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king
2 Chronicles	005	004	All the elders of Israel came:  and the Levites took up the ark;
2 Chronicles	005	005	and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting,
2 Chronicles	005	006	King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were
2 Chronicles	005	007	The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to
2 Chronicles	005	008	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place
2 Chronicles	005	009	The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen
2 Chronicles	005	010	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
2 Chronicles	005	011	It happened, when the priests were come out of the holy place,
2 Chronicles	005	012	also the Levites who were the singers, all of them,
2 Chronicles	005	013	it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one,
2 Chronicles	005	014	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason
2 Chronicles	006	001	Then spoke Solomon, Yahweh has said that he would dwell
2 Chronicles	006	002	But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you
2 Chronicles	006	003	The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel:
2 Chronicles	006	004	He said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke
2 Chronicles	006	005	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
2 Chronicles	006	006	but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there;
2 Chronicles	006	007	Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
2 Chronicles	006	008	But Yahweh said to David my father, Whereas it was in your
2 Chronicles	006	009	nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who
2 Chronicles	006	010	Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I am risen up
2 Chronicles	006	011	There have I set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	006	012	He stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all
2 Chronicles	006	013	(for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long,
2 Chronicles	006	014	and he said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you,
2 Chronicles	006	015	who have kept with your servant David my father that which you
2 Chronicles	006	016	Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
2 Chronicles	006	017	Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified,
2 Chronicles	006	018	But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth?
2 Chronicles	006	019	Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant,
2 Chronicles	006	020	that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night,
2 Chronicles	006	021	Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your
2 Chronicles	006	022	If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him
2 Chronicles	006	023	then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants,
2 Chronicles	006	024	If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy,
2 Chronicles	006	025	then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel,
2 Chronicles	006	026	When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
2 Chronicles	006	027	then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants,
2 Chronicles	006	028	If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
2 Chronicles	006	029	whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man,
2 Chronicles	006	030	then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render
2 Chronicles	006	031	that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they
2 Chronicles	006	032	Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel,
2 Chronicles	006	033	then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place,
2 Chronicles	006	034	If your people go out to battle against their enemies,
2 Chronicles	006	035	then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication,
2 Chronicles	006	036	If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin),
2 Chronicles	006	037	yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they
2 Chronicles	006	038	if they return to you with all their heart and with all
2 Chronicles	006	039	then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place,
2 Chronicles	006	040	Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your
2 Chronicles	006	041	Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place,
2 Chronicles	006	042	Yahweh God, don't turn away the face of your anointed:
2 Chronicles	007	001	Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
2 Chronicles	007	002	The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	007	003	All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down,
2 Chronicles	007	004	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
2 Chronicles	007	005	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen,
2 Chronicles	007	006	The priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites
2 Chronicles	007	007	Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before
2 Chronicles	007	008	So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all
2 Chronicles	007	009	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly:
2 Chronicles	007	010	On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
2 Chronicles	007	011	Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king's house:
2 Chronicles	007	012	Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him,
2 Chronicles	007	013	If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command
2 Chronicles	007	014	if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
2 Chronicles	007	015	Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer
2 Chronicles	007	016	For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my
2 Chronicles	007	017	As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked,
2 Chronicles	007	018	then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I
2 Chronicles	007	019	But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments
2 Chronicles	007	020	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
2 Chronicles	007	021	This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall
2 Chronicles	007	022	They shall answer, Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of
2 Chronicles	008	001	It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had
2 Chronicles	008	002	that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them,
2 Chronicles	008	003	Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it.
2 Chronicles	008	004	He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities,
2 Chronicles	008	005	Also he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower,
2 Chronicles	008	006	and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had,
2 Chronicles	008	007	As for all the people who were left of the Hittites,
2 Chronicles	008	008	of their children who were left after them in the land,
2 Chronicles	008	009	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
2 Chronicles	008	010	These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty,
2 Chronicles	008	011	Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
2 Chronicles	008	012	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar
2 Chronicles	008	013	even as the duty of every day required, offering according to
2 Chronicles	008	014	He appointed, according to the ordinance of David
2 Chronicles	008	015	They didn't depart from the commandment of the king to the priests
2 Chronicles	008	016	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the
2 Chronicles	008	017	Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore
2 Chronicles	008	018	Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea
2 Chronicles	009	001	When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon,
2 Chronicles	009	002	Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything
2 Chronicles	009	003	When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
2 Chronicles	009	004	and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
2 Chronicles	009	005	She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my
2 Chronicles	009	006	However I didn't believe their words, until I came, and my eyes
2 Chronicles	009	007	Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants,
2 Chronicles	009	008	Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you
2 Chronicles	009	009	She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold,
2 Chronicles	009	010	The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought
2 Chronicles	009	011	The king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	009	012	King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
2 Chronicles	009	013	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
2 Chronicles	009	014	besides that which the traders and merchants brought:
2 Chronicles	009	015	King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold;
2 Chronicles	009	016	[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold;
2 Chronicles	009	017	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
2 Chronicles	009	018	And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
2 Chronicles	009	019	Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on
2 Chronicles	009	020	All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels
2 Chronicles	009	021	For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants
2 Chronicles	009	022	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in
2 Chronicles	009	023	All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
2 Chronicles	009	024	They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels
2 Chronicles	009	025	Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve
2 Chronicles	009	026	He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land
2 Chronicles	009	027	The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,
2 Chronicles	009	028	They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
2 Chronicles	009	029	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,
2 Chronicles	009	030	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles	009	031	Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city
2 Chronicles	010	001	Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem
2 Chronicles	010	002	It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it,
2 Chronicles	010	003	They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came,
2 Chronicles	010	004	Your father made our yoke grievous:  now therefore make you
2 Chronicles	010	005	He said to them, Come again to me after three days.
2 Chronicles	010	006	King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before
2 Chronicles	010	007	They spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to this people,
2 Chronicles	010	008	But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
2 Chronicles	010	009	He said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer
2 Chronicles	010	010	The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying,
2 Chronicles	010	011	Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
2 Chronicles	010	012	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
2 Chronicles	010	013	The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
2 Chronicles	010	014	and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
2 Chronicles	010	015	So the king didn't listen to the people; for it was brought about
2 Chronicles	010	016	When all Israel saw that the king didn't listen to them,
2 Chronicles	010	017	But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities
2 Chronicles	010	018	Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject
2 Chronicles	010	019	So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles	011	001	When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house
2 Chronicles	011	002	But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
2 Chronicles	011	003	Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah,
2 Chronicles	011	004	Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against
2 Chronicles	011	005	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
2 Chronicles	011	006	He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
2 Chronicles	011	007	Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
2 Chronicles	011	008	and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
2 Chronicles	011	009	and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
2 Chronicles	011	010	and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and
2 Chronicles	011	011	He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them,
2 Chronicles	011	012	In every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them
2 Chronicles	011	013	The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted
2 Chronicles	011	014	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession,
2 Chronicles	011	015	and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for
2 Chronicles	011	016	After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their
2 Chronicles	011	017	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
2 Chronicles	011	018	Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth
2 Chronicles	011	019	and she bore him sons:  Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles	011	020	After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore
2 Chronicles	011	021	Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his
2 Chronicles	011	022	Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief,
2 Chronicles	011	023	He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all
2 Chronicles	012	001	It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established,
2 Chronicles	012	002	It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
2 Chronicles	012	003	with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen.
2 Chronicles	012	004	He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah,
2 Chronicles	012	005	Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes
2 Chronicles	012	006	Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
2 Chronicles	012	007	When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh
2 Chronicles	012	008	Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know
2 Chronicles	012	009	So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	012	010	King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
2 Chronicles	012	011	It was so, that as often as the king entered into the house
2 Chronicles	012	012	When he humbled himself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from him,
2 Chronicles	012	013	So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
2 Chronicles	012	014	He did that which was evil, because he didn't set his heart
2 Chronicles	012	015	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written
2 Chronicles	012	016	Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David:
2 Chronicles	013	001	In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
2 Chronicles	013	002	Three years reigned he in Jerusalem:  and his mother's
2 Chronicles	013	003	Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war,
2 Chronicles	013	004	Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country
2 Chronicles	013	005	Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel,
2 Chronicles	013	006	Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
2 Chronicles	013	007	There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows,
2 Chronicles	013	008	Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand
2 Chronicles	013	009	Haven't you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron,
2 Chronicles	013	010	But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him;
2 Chronicles	013	011	and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt
2 Chronicles	013	012	Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with
2 Chronicles	013	013	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them:
2 Chronicles	013	014	When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
2 Chronicles	013	015	Then the men of Judah gave a shout:  and as the men of Judah shouted,
2 Chronicles	013	016	The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered
2 Chronicles	013	017	Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter:
2 Chronicles	013	018	Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
2 Chronicles	013	019	Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
2 Chronicles	013	020	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah:
2 Chronicles	013	021	But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives,
2 Chronicles	013	022	The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
2 Chronicles	014	001	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
2 Chronicles	014	002	Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:
2 Chronicles	014	003	for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places,
2 Chronicles	014	004	and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
2 Chronicles	014	005	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
2 Chronicles	014	006	He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet,
2 Chronicles	014	007	For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
2 Chronicles	014	008	Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah
2 Chronicles	014	009	There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
2 Chronicles	014	010	Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array
2 Chronicles	014	011	Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides
2 Chronicles	014	012	So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
2 Chronicles	014	013	Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar:
2 Chronicles	014	014	They struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
2 Chronicles	014	015	They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away
2 Chronicles	015	001	The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:
2 Chronicles	015	002	and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear you me, Asa,
2 Chronicles	015	003	Now for a long season Israel was without the true God,
2 Chronicles	015	004	But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God
2 Chronicles	015	005	In those times there was no peace to him who went out,
2 Chronicles	015	006	They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city
2 Chronicles	015	007	But be you strong, and don't let your hands be slack;
2 Chronicles	015	008	When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
2 Chronicles	015	009	He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned
2 Chronicles	015	010	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month,
2 Chronicles	015	011	They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they
2 Chronicles	015	012	They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of
2 Chronicles	015	013	and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel,
2 Chronicles	015	014	They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting,
2 Chronicles	015	015	All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with
2 Chronicles	015	016	Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen,
2 Chronicles	015	017	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
2 Chronicles	015	018	He brought into the house of God the things that his father
2 Chronicles	015	019	There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of
2 Chronicles	016	001	In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king
2 Chronicles	016	002	Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures
2 Chronicles	016	003	[There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between
2 Chronicles	016	004	Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his
2 Chronicles	016	005	It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off
2 Chronicles	016	006	Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones
2 Chronicles	016	007	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
2 Chronicles	016	008	Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots
2 Chronicles	016	009	For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth,
2 Chronicles	016	010	Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison;
2 Chronicles	016	011	Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are
2 Chronicles	016	012	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet;
2 Chronicles	016	013	Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
2 Chronicles	016	014	They buried him in his own tombs, which he had hewn out
2 Chronicles	017	001	Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened
2 Chronicles	017	002	He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set
2 Chronicles	017	003	Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
2 Chronicles	017	004	but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments,
2 Chronicles	017	005	Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand;
2 Chronicles	017	006	His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh:  and furthermore
2 Chronicles	017	007	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes,
2 Chronicles	017	008	and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
2 Chronicles	017	009	They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them;
2 Chronicles	017	010	The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were
2 Chronicles	017	011	Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents,
2 Chronicles	017	012	Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
2 Chronicles	017	013	He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war,
2 Chronicles	017	014	This was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses:
2 Chronicles	017	015	and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
2 Chronicles	017	016	and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
2 Chronicles	017	017	Of Benjamin:  Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two
2 Chronicles	017	018	and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty
2 Chronicles	017	019	These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom
2 Chronicles	018	001	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined
2 Chronicles	018	002	After certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
2 Chronicles	018	003	Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you
2 Chronicles	018	004	Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first
2 Chronicles	018	005	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together,
2 Chronicles	018	006	But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of Yahweh besides,
2 Chronicles	018	007	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
2 Chronicles	018	008	Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly
2 Chronicles	018	009	Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
2 Chronicles	018	010	Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said,
2 Chronicles	018	011	All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead,
2 Chronicles	018	012	The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold,
2 Chronicles	018	013	Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.
2 Chronicles	018	014	When he was come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah,
2 Chronicles	018	015	The king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you
2 Chronicles	018	016	He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep
2 Chronicles	018	017	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you
2 Chronicles	018	018	[Micaiah] said, "Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh:  I saw
2 Chronicles	018	019	Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may
2 Chronicles	018	020	There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said,
2 Chronicles	018	021	He said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth
2 Chronicles	018	022	Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit
2 Chronicles	018	023	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah
2 Chronicles	018	024	Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you
2 Chronicles	018	025	The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
2 Chronicles	018	026	and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
2 Chronicles	018	027	Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not
2 Chronicles	018	028	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
2 Chronicles	018	029	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
2 Chronicles	018	030	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of
2 Chronicles	018	031	It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
2 Chronicles	018	032	It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was
2 Chronicles	018	033	A certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck
2 Chronicles	018	034	The battle increased that day:  however the king of Israel stayed
2 Chronicles	019	001	Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
2 Chronicles	019	002	Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him,
2 Chronicles	019	003	Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you
2 Chronicles	019	004	Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem:  and he went out again among
2 Chronicles	019	005	He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities
2 Chronicles	019	006	and said to the judges, Consider what you do:  for you
2 Chronicles	019	007	Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you; take heed and do it:
2 Chronicles	019	008	Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and
2 Chronicles	019	009	He charged them, saying, Thus shall you do in the fear
2 Chronicles	019	010	Whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers
2 Chronicles	019	011	Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
2 Chronicles	020	001	It happened after this, that the children of Moab,
2 Chronicles	020	002	Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes
2 Chronicles	020	003	Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek to Yahweh;
2 Chronicles	020	004	Judah gathered themselves together, to seek [help] of Yahweh:
2 Chronicles	020	005	Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	020	006	and he said, Yahweh, the God of our fathers, aren't you
2 Chronicles	020	007	Did not you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land
2 Chronicles	020	008	They lived therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein
2 Chronicles	020	009	If evil come on us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence,
2 Chronicles	020	010	Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir,
2 Chronicles	020	011	behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession,
2 Chronicles	020	012	Our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this
2 Chronicles	020	013	All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones,
2 Chronicles	020	014	Then on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
2 Chronicles	020	015	and he said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants
2 Chronicles	020	016	Tomorrow go you down against them:  behold, they come up
2 Chronicles	020	017	You shall not need to fight in this [battle]: set yourselves,
2 Chronicles	020	018	Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground;
2 Chronicles	020	019	The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children
2 Chronicles	020	020	They rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness
2 Chronicles	020	021	When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those
2 Chronicles	020	022	When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers
2 Chronicles	020	023	For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
2 Chronicles	020	024	When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness,
2 Chronicles	020	025	When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them,
2 Chronicles	020	026	On the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
2 Chronicles	020	027	Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat
2 Chronicles	020	028	They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps
2 Chronicles	020	029	The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries,
2 Chronicles	020	030	So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him
2 Chronicles	020	031	Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:  he was thirty-five years old when
2 Chronicles	020	032	He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn't turn aside
2 Chronicles	020	033	However the high places were not taken away; neither as yet
2 Chronicles	020	034	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
2 Chronicles	020	035	After this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
2 Chronicles	020	036	and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish;
2 Chronicles	020	037	Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied
2 Chronicles	021	001	Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
2 Chronicles	021	002	He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat:  Azariah, and Jehiel,
2 Chronicles	021	003	Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold,
2 Chronicles	021	004	Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father,
2 Chronicles	021	005	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	021	006	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
2 Chronicles	021	007	However Yahweh would not destroy the house of David, because of
2 Chronicles	021	008	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah,
2 Chronicles	021	009	Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots
2 Chronicles	021	010	So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day:
2 Chronicles	021	011	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah,
2 Chronicles	021	012	There came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
2 Chronicles	021	013	but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made
2 Chronicles	021	014	behold, Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people,
2 Chronicles	021	015	and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels,
2 Chronicles	021	016	Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines,
2 Chronicles	021	017	and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried
2 Chronicles	021	018	After all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with
2 Chronicles	021	019	It happened, in process of time, at the end of two years,
2 Chronicles	021	020	Thirty-two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
2 Chronicles	022	001	The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest
2 Chronicles	022	002	Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	022	003	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother
2 Chronicles	022	004	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did
2 Chronicles	022	005	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram
2 Chronicles	022	006	He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had
2 Chronicles	022	007	Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram:
2 Chronicles	022	008	It happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house
2 Chronicles	022	009	He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding
2 Chronicles	022	010	Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
2 Chronicles	022	011	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
2 Chronicles	022	012	He was with them hid in the house of God six years:
2 Chronicles	023	001	In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took
2 Chronicles	023	002	They went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out
2 Chronicles	023	003	All the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God.
2 Chronicles	023	004	This is the thing that you shall do:  a third part of you,
2 Chronicles	023	005	and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
2 Chronicles	023	006	But let none come into the house of Yahweh, save the priests,
2 Chronicles	023	007	The Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
2 Chronicles	023	008	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada
2 Chronicles	023	009	Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
2 Chronicles	023	010	He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand,
2 Chronicles	023	011	Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown
2 Chronicles	023	012	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
2 Chronicles	023	013	and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at
2 Chronicles	023	014	Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set
2 Chronicles	023	015	So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse
2 Chronicles	023	016	Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people,
2 Chronicles	023	017	All the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down,
2 Chronicles	023	018	Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Yahweh under
2 Chronicles	023	019	He set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	023	020	He took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
2 Chronicles	023	021	So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet.
2 Chronicles	024	001	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	024	002	Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days
2 Chronicles	024	003	Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he became the father
2 Chronicles	024	004	It happened after this, that Joash was minded to restore
2 Chronicles	024	005	He gathered together the priests and the Levites,
2 Chronicles	024	006	The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him,
2 Chronicles	024	007	For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up
2 Chronicles	024	008	So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it
2 Chronicles	024	009	They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	024	010	All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
2 Chronicles	024	011	It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the king's
2 Chronicles	024	012	The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
2 Chronicles	024	013	So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward
2 Chronicles	024	014	When they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money
2 Chronicles	024	015	But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died;
2 Chronicles	024	016	They buried him in the city of David among the kings,
2 Chronicles	024	017	Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
2 Chronicles	024	018	They forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
2 Chronicles	024	019	Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh;
2 Chronicles	024	020	The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
2 Chronicles	024	021	They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
2 Chronicles	024	022	Thus Joash the king didn't remember the kindness which
2 Chronicles	024	023	It happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians
2 Chronicles	024	024	For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men;
2 Chronicles	024	025	When they were departed for him (for they left him very sick),
2 Chronicles	024	026	These are those who conspired against him:  Zabad the son
2 Chronicles	024	027	Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens
2 Chronicles	025	001	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	025	002	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not
2 Chronicles	025	003	Now it happened, when the kingdom was established to him,
2 Chronicles	025	004	But he didn't put their children to death, but did according
2 Chronicles	025	005	Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them
2 Chronicles	025	006	He hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out
2 Chronicles	025	007	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, don't let
2 Chronicles	025	008	But if you will go, do [valiantly], be strong for the battle:
2 Chronicles	025	009	Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred
2 Chronicles	025	010	Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that
2 Chronicles	025	011	Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went
2 Chronicles	025	012	[other] ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive,
2 Chronicles	025	013	But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they
2 Chronicles	025	014	Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter
2 Chronicles	025	015	Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah,
2 Chronicles	025	016	It happened, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him,
2 Chronicles	025	017	Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash,
2 Chronicles	025	018	Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
2 Chronicles	025	019	You say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart
2 Chronicles	025	020	But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might
2 Chronicles	025	021	So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king
2 Chronicles	025	022	Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every
2 Chronicles	025	023	Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
2 Chronicles	025	024	[He took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels
2 Chronicles	025	025	Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
2 Chronicles	025	026	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
2 Chronicles	025	027	Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
2 Chronicles	025	028	They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers
2 Chronicles	026	001	All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
2 Chronicles	026	002	He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
2 Chronicles	026	003	Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	026	004	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
2 Chronicles	026	005	He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah,
2 Chronicles	026	006	He went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke
2 Chronicles	026	007	God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
2 Chronicles	026	008	The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah:  and his name spread abroad
2 Chronicles	026	009	Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
2 Chronicles	026	010	He built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns,
2 Chronicles	026	011	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war
2 Chronicles	026	012	The whole number of the heads of fathers' [houses], even the mighty
2 Chronicles	026	013	Under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
2 Chronicles	026	014	Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields,
2 Chronicles	026	015	He made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men,
2 Chronicles	026	016	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that
2 Chronicles	026	017	Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty
2 Chronicles	026	018	and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It pertains
2 Chronicles	026	019	Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand
2 Chronicles	026	020	Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him,
2 Chronicles	026	021	Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death,
2 Chronicles	026	022	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
2 Chronicles	026	023	So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
2 Chronicles	027	001	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	027	002	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	027	003	He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall
2 Chronicles	027	004	Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah,
2 Chronicles	027	005	He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon,
2 Chronicles	027	006	So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before
2 Chronicles	027	007	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars,
2 Chronicles	027	008	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign,
2 Chronicles	027	009	Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
2 Chronicles	028	001	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
2 Chronicles	028	002	but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
2 Chronicles	028	003	Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
2 Chronicles	028	004	He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
2 Chronicles	028	005	Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king
2 Chronicles	028	006	For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred
2 Chronicles	028	007	Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son,
2 Chronicles	028	008	The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers
2 Chronicles	028	009	But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded:
2 Chronicles	028	010	Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah
2 Chronicles	028	011	Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you
2 Chronicles	028	012	Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
2 Chronicles	028	013	and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here:
2 Chronicles	028	014	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before
2 Chronicles	028	015	The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took
2 Chronicles	028	016	At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria
2 Chronicles	028	017	For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah,
2 Chronicles	028	018	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland,
2 Chronicles	028	019	For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
2 Chronicles	028	020	Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him,
2 Chronicles	028	021	For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	028	022	In the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	028	023	For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him;
2 Chronicles	028	024	Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
2 Chronicles	028	025	In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense
2 Chronicles	028	026	Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold,
2 Chronicles	028	027	Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,
2 Chronicles	029	001	Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old;
2 Chronicles	029	002	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to
2 Chronicles	029	003	He in the first year of his reign, in the first month,
2 Chronicles	029	004	He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
2 Chronicles	029	005	and said to them, Hear me, you Levites; now sanctify yourselves,
2 Chronicles	029	006	For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
2 Chronicles	029	007	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out
2 Chronicles	029	008	Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	029	009	For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
2 Chronicles	029	010	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God
2 Chronicles	029	011	My sons, don't be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you
2 Chronicles	029	012	Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai,
2 Chronicles	029	013	and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons
2 Chronicles	029	014	and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons
2 Chronicles	029	015	They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves,
2 Chronicles	029	016	The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	029	017	Now they began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify,
2 Chronicles	029	018	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within [the palace],
2 Chronicles	029	019	Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
2 Chronicles	029	020	Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes
2 Chronicles	029	021	They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs,
2 Chronicles	029	022	So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood,
2 Chronicles	029	023	They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before
2 Chronicles	029	024	and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with
2 Chronicles	029	025	He set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals,
2 Chronicles	029	026	The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
2 Chronicles	029	027	Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar.
2 Chronicles	029	028	All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the
2 Chronicles	029	029	When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who
2 Chronicles	029	030	Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded
2 Chronicles	029	031	Then Hezekiah answered, Now you have consecrated yourselves
2 Chronicles	029	032	The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought
2 Chronicles	029	033	The consecrated things were six hundred oxen and
2 Chronicles	029	034	But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
2 Chronicles	029	035	Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
2 Chronicles	029	036	Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God
2 Chronicles	030	001	Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
2 Chronicles	030	002	For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly
2 Chronicles	030	003	For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
2 Chronicles	030	004	The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
2 Chronicles	030	005	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
2 Chronicles	030	006	So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
2 Chronicles	030	007	Don't be you like your fathers, and like your brothers,
2 Chronicles	030	008	Now don't you be stiff-necked, as your fathers were;
2 Chronicles	030	009	For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children
2 Chronicles	030	010	So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
2 Chronicles	030	011	Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
2 Chronicles	030	012	Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart,
2 Chronicles	030	013	There assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
2 Chronicles	030	014	They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	030	015	Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the
2 Chronicles	030	016	They stood in their place after their order, according to the law
2 Chronicles	030	017	For there were many in the assembly who had not
2 Chronicles	030	018	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim
2 Chronicles	030	019	who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers,
2 Chronicles	030	020	Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2 Chronicles	030	021	The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept
2 Chronicles	030	022	Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good
2 Chronicles	030	023	The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days;
2 Chronicles	030	024	For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings
2 Chronicles	030	025	All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites,
2 Chronicles	030	026	So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time
2 Chronicles	030	027	Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people:
2 Chronicles	031	001	Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went
2 Chronicles	031	002	Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites
2 Chronicles	031	003	[He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for
2 Chronicles	031	004	Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give
2 Chronicles	031	005	As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel
2 Chronicles	031	006	The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities
2 Chronicles	031	007	In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
2 Chronicles	031	008	When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps,
2 Chronicles	031	009	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites
2 Chronicles	031	010	Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him
2 Chronicles	031	011	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh;
2 Chronicles	031	012	They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
2 Chronicles	031	013	Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
2 Chronicles	031	014	Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east [gate],
2 Chronicles	031	015	Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah,
2 Chronicles	031	016	besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males,
2 Chronicles	031	017	and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests
2 Chronicles	031	018	and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones,
2 Chronicles	031	019	Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields
2 Chronicles	031	020	Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he worked that
2 Chronicles	031	021	In every work that he began in the service of the house of God,
2 Chronicles	032	001	After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king
2 Chronicles	032	002	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
2 Chronicles	032	003	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
2 Chronicles	032	004	So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped
2 Chronicles	032	005	He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down,
2 Chronicles	032	006	He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
2 Chronicles	032	007	Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid nor dismayed for
2 Chronicles	032	008	with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God
2 Chronicles	032	009	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
2 Chronicles	032	010	Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do you trust,
2 Chronicles	032	011	Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die
2 Chronicles	032	012	Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars,
2 Chronicles	032	013	Don't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples
2 Chronicles	032	014	Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers
2 Chronicles	032	015	Now therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade
2 Chronicles	032	016	His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against
2 Chronicles	032	017	He wrote also letters, to rail on Yahweh, the God of Israel,
2 Chronicles	032	018	They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people
2 Chronicles	032	019	They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples
2 Chronicles	032	020	Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz,
2 Chronicles	032	021	Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor,
2 Chronicles	032	022	Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
2 Chronicles	032	023	Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things
2 Chronicles	032	024	In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death:  and he prayed
2 Chronicles	032	025	But Hezekiah didn't render again according to the benefit done to him;
2 Chronicles	032	026	Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
2 Chronicles	032	027	Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor:
2 Chronicles	032	028	storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil;
2 Chronicles	032	029	Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
2 Chronicles	032	030	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters
2 Chronicles	032	031	However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes
2 Chronicles	032	032	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds,
2 Chronicles	032	033	Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
2 Chronicles	033	001	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	033	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	033	003	For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
2 Chronicles	033	004	He built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said,
2 Chronicles	033	005	He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts
2 Chronicles	033	006	He also made his children to pass through the fire in
2 Chronicles	033	007	He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made,
2 Chronicles	033	008	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off
2 Chronicles	033	009	Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	033	010	Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they
2 Chronicles	033	011	Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army
2 Chronicles	033	012	When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled
2 Chronicles	033	013	He prayed to him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his
2 Chronicles	033	014	Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David,
2 Chronicles	033	015	He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house
2 Chronicles	033	016	He built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices
2 Chronicles	033	017	Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places,
2 Chronicles	033	018	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God,
2 Chronicles	033	019	His prayer also, and how [God] was entreated of him, and all
2 Chronicles	033	020	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
2 Chronicles	033	021	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	033	022	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did
2 Chronicles	033	023	He didn't humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his
2 Chronicles	033	024	His servants conspired against him, and put him to death
2 Chronicles	033	025	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired
2 Chronicles	034	001	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	034	002	He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked
2 Chronicles	034	003	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
2 Chronicles	034	004	They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence;
2 Chronicles	034	005	He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged
2 Chronicles	034	006	[So did he] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon,
2 Chronicles	034	007	He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved
2 Chronicles	034	008	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
2 Chronicles	034	009	They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money
2 Chronicles	034	010	They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the
2 Chronicles	034	011	even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it,
2 Chronicles	034	012	The men did the work faithfully:  and the overseers of them
2 Chronicles	034	013	Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set
2 Chronicles	034	014	When they brought out the money that was brought into the house
2 Chronicles	034	015	Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book
2 Chronicles	034	016	Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back
2 Chronicles	034	017	They have emptied out the money that was found in the house
2 Chronicles	034	018	Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has
2 Chronicles	034	019	It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law,
2 Chronicles	034	020	The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
2 Chronicles	034	021	Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel
2 Chronicles	034	022	So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded],
2 Chronicles	034	023	She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Tell you
2 Chronicles	034	024	Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place,
2 Chronicles	034	025	Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods,
2 Chronicles	034	026	But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	034	027	because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself
2 Chronicles	034	028	Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered
2 Chronicles	034	029	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders
2 Chronicles	034	030	The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men
2 Chronicles	034	031	The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh,
2 Chronicles	034	032	He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin
2 Chronicles	034	033	Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
2 Chronicles	035	001	Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem:  and they killed
2 Chronicles	035	002	He set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them
2 Chronicles	035	003	He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy
2 Chronicles	035	004	Prepare yourselves after your fathers' houses by your divisions,
2 Chronicles	035	005	Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers'
2 Chronicles	035	006	Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for
2 Chronicles	035	007	Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock,
2 Chronicles	035	008	His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people,
2 Chronicles	035	009	Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers,
2 Chronicles	035	010	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in
2 Chronicles	035	011	They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood
2 Chronicles	035	012	They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them
2 Chronicles	035	013	They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance:
2 Chronicles	035	014	Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests,
2 Chronicles	035	015	The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
2 Chronicles	035	016	So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day,
2 Chronicles	035	017	The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover
2 Chronicles	035	018	There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days
2 Chronicles	035	019	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.
2 Chronicles	035	020	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king
2 Chronicles	035	021	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you,
2 Chronicles	035	022	Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him,
2 Chronicles	035	023	The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants,
2 Chronicles	035	024	So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in
2 Chronicles	035	025	Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:  and all the singing men
2 Chronicles	035	026	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds,
2 Chronicles	035	027	and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written
2 Chronicles	036	001	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
2 Chronicles	036	002	Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	036	003	The king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land
2 Chronicles	036	004	The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
2 Chronicles	036	005	Jehoiakim was Twenty-five years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	036	006	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
2 Chronicles	036	007	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh
2 Chronicles	036	008	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
2 Chronicles	036	009	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	036	010	At the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought
2 Chronicles	036	011	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;
2 Chronicles	036	012	and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God;
2 Chronicles	036	013	He also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
2 Chronicles	036	014	Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people,
2 Chronicles	036	015	Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers,
2 Chronicles	036	016	but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
2 Chronicles	036	017	Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans,
2 Chronicles	036	018	All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
2 Chronicles	036	019	They burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles	036	020	He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon;
2 Chronicles	036	021	to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah,
2 Chronicles	036	022	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
2 Chronicles	036	023	Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
Ezra	001	001	Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
Ezra	001	002	Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
Ezra	001	003	Whoever there is among you of all his people, his God be
Ezra	001	004	Whoever is left, in any place where he sojourns, let the men
Ezra	001	005	Then rose up the heads of fathers' [houses] of Judah and Benjamin,
Ezra	001	006	All those who were round about them strengthened their hands
Ezra	001	007	Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Yahweh,

Ezra	002	068	Some of the heads of fathers' [houses], when they came to
Ezra	002	069	they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work
Ezra	002	070	So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people,
Ezra	003	001	When the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel
Ezra	003	002	Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers
Ezra	003	003	They set the altar on its base; for fear was on them because of
Ezra	003	004	They kept the feast of tents, as it is written, and [offered]
Ezra	003	005	and afterward the continual burnt offering, and [the offerings]
Ezra	003	006	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
Ezra	003	007	They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters;
Ezra	003	008	Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God
Ezra	003	009	Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and
Ezra	003	010	When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh,
Ezra	003	011	They sang one to another in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh,
Ezra	003	012	But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers'
Ezra	003	013	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout
Ezra	004	001	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that
Ezra	004	002	then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads
Ezra	004	003	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers'
Ezra	004	004	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
Ezra	004	005	and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose,
Ezra	004	006	In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
Ezra	004	007	In the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
Ezra	004	008	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
Ezra	004	009	then [wrote] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe,
Ezra	004	010	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar
Ezra	004	011	This is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king:
Ezra	004	012	Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up
Ezra	004	013	Be it known now to the king that if this city is built,
Ezra	004	014	Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not
Ezra	004	015	that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers:
Ezra	004	016	We inform the king that, if this city be built, and the
Ezra	004	017	[Then] sent the king an answer to Rehum the chancellor,
Ezra	004	018	The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra	004	019	I decreed, and search has been made, and it is found that this
Ezra	004	020	There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem,
Ezra	004	021	Make you now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this
Ezra	004	022	Take heed that you not be slack herein:  why should damage
Ezra	004	023	Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read
Ezra	004	024	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem;
Ezra	005	001	Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
Ezra	005	002	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua
Ezra	005	003	At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond
Ezra	005	004	Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men
Ezra	005	005	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they
Ezra	005	006	The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River,
Ezra	005	007	they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus:
Ezra	005	008	Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah,
Ezra	005	009	Then asked we those elders, and said to them thus, Who gave
Ezra	005	010	We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might
Ezra	005	011	Thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
Ezra	005	012	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath,
Ezra	005	013	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king
Ezra	005	014	The gold and silver vessels also of the house of God,
Ezra	005	015	and he said to him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple
Ezra	005	016	Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations
Ezra	005	017	Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search
Ezra	006	001	Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made
Ezra	006	002	There was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province
Ezra	006	003	In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree:
Ezra	006	004	with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber:
Ezra	006	005	Also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God,
Ezra	006	006	Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai,
Ezra	006	007	let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor
Ezra	006	008	Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to these elders
Ezra	006	009	That which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams,
Ezra	006	010	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor to the God of heaven,
Ezra	006	011	Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word,
Ezra	006	012	and the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow
Ezra	006	013	Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai,
Ezra	006	014	The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying
Ezra	006	015	This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
Ezra	006	016	The children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest
Ezra	006	017	They offered at the dedication of this house of God one
Ezra	006	018	They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in
Ezra	006	019	The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth
Ezra	006	020	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together;
Ezra	006	021	The children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity,
Ezra	006	022	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
Ezra	007	001	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king
Ezra	007	002	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
Ezra	007	003	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
Ezra	007	004	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
Ezra	007	005	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
Ezra	007	006	this Ezra went up from Babylon:  and he was a ready scribe
Ezra	007	007	There went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests,
Ezra	007	008	He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh
Ezra	007	009	For on the first [day] of the first month began he to go up
Ezra	007	010	For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, and to do it,
Ezra	007	011	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
Ezra	007	012	Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe
Ezra	007	013	I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel,
Ezra	007	014	Because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors,
Ezra	007	015	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
Ezra	007	016	and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the
Ezra	007	017	therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls,
Ezra	007	018	Whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do
Ezra	007	019	The vessels that are given you for the service of the house
Ezra	007	020	Whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God,
Ezra	007	021	I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all
Ezra	007	022	to one hundred talents of silver, and to one hundred measures
Ezra	007	023	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done
Ezra	007	024	Also we inform you, that touching any of the priests and Levites,
Ezra	007	025	You, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God who is in your hand,
Ezra	007	026	Whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king,
Ezra	007	027	Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such
Ezra	007	028	and has extended loving kindness to me before the king,
Ezra	008	001	Now these are the heads of their fathers' [houses], and this
Ezra	008	002	Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom.  Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel.
Ezra	008	003	Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah;
Ezra	008	004	Of the sons of Pahathmoab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah;
Ezra	008	005	Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him
Ezra	008	006	Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with
Ezra	008	007	Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah;
Ezra	008	008	Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael;
Ezra	008	009	Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him
Ezra	008	010	Of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him
Ezra	008	011	Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with
Ezra	008	012	Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him
Ezra	008	013	Of the sons of Adonikam, [who were] the last; and these are
Ezra	008	014	Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.
Ezra	008	015	I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava;
Ezra	008	016	Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan,
Ezra	008	017	I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia;
Ezra	008	018	According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us
Ezra	008	019	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
Ezra	008	020	and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for
Ezra	008	021	Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava,
Ezra	008	022	For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers
Ezra	008	023	So we fasted and begged our God for this:  and he was
Ezra	008	024	Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests,
Ezra	008	025	and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
Ezra	008	026	I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver,
Ezra	008	027	and twenty bowls of gold, of one thousand darics; and two
Ezra	008	028	I said to them, You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy;
Ezra	008	029	Watch you, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs
Ezra	008	030	So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver
Ezra	008	031	Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day]
Ezra	008	032	We came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
Ezra	008	033	On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels
Ezra	008	034	the whole by number and by weight:  and all the weight was
Ezra	008	035	The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile,
Ezra	008	036	They delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps,
Ezra	009	001	Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me,
Ezra	009	002	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and
Ezra	009	003	When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe,
Ezra	009	004	Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of
Ezra	009	005	At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation,
Ezra	009	006	and I said, my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
Ezra	009	007	Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty
Ezra	009	008	Now for a little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh
Ezra	009	009	For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us
Ezra	009	010	Now, our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
Ezra	009	011	which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying,
Ezra	009	012	now therefore don't give your daughters to their sons,
Ezra	009	013	After all that is come on us for our evil deeds, and for our
Ezra	009	014	shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity
Ezra	009	015	Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous; for we are left
Ezra	010	001	Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting
Ezra	010	002	Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
Ezra	010	003	Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
Ezra	010	004	Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you:
Ezra	010	005	Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites,
Ezra	010	006	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went
Ezra	010	007	They made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all
Ezra	010	008	and that whoever didn't come within three days, according to
Ezra	010	009	Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
Ezra	010	010	Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have trespassed,
Ezra	010	011	Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
Ezra	010	012	Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, As you
Ezra	010	013	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain,
Ezra	010	014	Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let
Ezra	010	015	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah
Ezra	010	016	The children of the captivity did so.  Ezra the priest,
Ezra	010	017	They made an end with all the men who had married foreign

Nehemiah	004	002	He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said,
Nehemiah	004	003	Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
Nehemiah	004	004	Hear, our God; for we are despised:  and turn back their
Nehemiah	004	005	and don't cover their iniquity, and don't let their sin be
Nehemiah	004	006	So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together
Nehemiah	004	007	But it happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians,
Nehemiah	004	008	and they conspired all of them together to come and fight
Nehemiah	004	009	But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them
Nehemiah	004	010	Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed,
Nehemiah	004	011	Our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
Nehemiah	004	012	It happened that when the Jews who lived by them came, they said
Nehemiah	004	013	Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall,
Nehemiah	004	014	I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers,
Nehemiah	004	015	It happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us,
Nehemiah	004	016	It happened from that time forth, that half of my servants worked
Nehemiah	004	017	They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves;
Nehemiah	004	018	and the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side,
Nehemiah	004	019	I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people,
Nehemiah	004	020	in whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you
Nehemiah	004	021	So we worked in the work:  and half of them held the spears
Nehemiah	004	022	Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let everyone
Nehemiah	004	023	So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men
Nehemiah	005	001	Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives
Nehemiah	005	002	For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many:
Nehemiah	005	003	Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields,
Nehemiah	005	004	There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's
Nehemiah	005	005	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children
Nehemiah	005	006	I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah	005	007	Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles
Nehemiah	005	008	I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers
Nehemiah	005	009	Also I said, The thing that you do is not good:  ought you
Nehemiah	005	010	I likewise, my brothers and my servants, do lend them money
Nehemiah	005	011	Please restore to them, even this day, their fields,
Nehemiah	005	012	Then said they, We will restore them, and will require
Nehemiah	005	013	Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man
Nehemiah	005	014	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
Nehemiah	005	015	But the former governors who were before me were chargeable to
Nehemiah	005	016	Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
Nehemiah	005	017	Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers,
Nehemiah	005	018	Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox
Nehemiah	005	019	Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done
Nehemiah	006	001	Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah,
Nehemiah	006	002	that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us
Nehemiah	006	003	I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work,
Nehemiah	006	004	They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered
Nehemiah	006	005	Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth
Nehemiah	006	006	in which was written, It is reported among the nations,
Nehemiah	006	007	You have also appointed prophets to preach of you
Nehemiah	006	008	Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done
Nehemiah	006	009	For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands
Nehemiah	006	010	I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son
Nehemiah	006	011	I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that,
Nehemiah	006	012	I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced
Nehemiah	006	013	For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
Nehemiah	006	014	Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works,
Nehemiah	006	015	So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth [day] of [the
Nehemiah	006	016	It happened, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all
Nehemiah	006	017	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
Nehemiah	006	018	For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was
Nehemiah	006	019	Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported
Nehemiah	007	001	Now it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,
Nehemiah	007	002	that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of
Nehemiah	007	003	I said to them, Don't let the gates of Jerusalem be opened
Nehemiah	007	004	Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein,

Nehemiah	009	008	and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with
Nehemiah	009	009	You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard
Nehemiah	009	010	and shown signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants,
Nehemiah	009	011	You divided the sea before them, so that they went through
Nehemiah	009	012	Moreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day;
Nehemiah	009	013	You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them
Nehemiah	009	014	and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded
Nehemiah	009	015	and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought
Nehemiah	009	016	But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck,
Nehemiah	009	017	and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders
Nehemiah	009	018	Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said,
Nehemiah	009	019	yet you in your manifold mercies didn't forsake them in
Nehemiah	009	020	You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn't
Nehemiah	009	021	Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness,
Nehemiah	009	022	Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot
Nehemiah	009	023	Their children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky,
Nehemiah	009	024	So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued
Nehemiah	009	025	They took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed
Nehemiah	009	026	Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you,
Nehemiah	009	027	Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries,
Nehemiah	009	028	But after they had rest, they did evil again before you;
Nehemiah	009	029	and testified against them, that you might bring them again
Nehemiah	009	030	Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified
Nehemiah	009	031	Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full
Nehemiah	009	032	Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God,
Nehemiah	009	033	However you are just in all that is come on us; for you have
Nehemiah	009	034	neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers,
Nehemiah	009	035	For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your
Nehemiah	009	036	Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you
Nehemiah	009	037	It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us

Nehemiah	012	043	They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced;
Nehemiah	012	044	On that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures,
Nehemiah	012	045	They kept the charge of their God, and the charge of
Nehemiah	012	046	For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief
Nehemiah	012	047	All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days
Nehemiah	013	001	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience
Nehemiah	013	002	because they didn't meet the children of Israel with bread
Nehemiah	013	003	It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
Nehemiah	013	004	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over
Nehemiah	013	005	had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid
Nehemiah	013	006	But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and
Nehemiah	013	007	and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib
Nehemiah	013	008	It grieved me sore:  therefore I cast forth all the household
Nehemiah	013	009	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers:
Nehemiah	013	010	I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them;
Nehemiah	013	011	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
Nehemiah	013	012	Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine
Nehemiah	013	013	I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
Nehemiah	013	014	Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don't wipe out
Nehemiah	013	015	In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on
Nehemiah	013	016	There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish,
Nehemiah	013	017	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them,
Nehemiah	013	018	Didn't your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all
Nehemiah	013	019	It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark
Nehemiah	013	020	So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged
Nehemiah	013	021	Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you
Nehemiah	013	022	I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves,
Nehemiah	013	023	In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod,

Esther	001	001	Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus
Esther	001	002	that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne
Esther	001	003	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his
Esther	001	004	He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor
Esther	001	005	When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day
Esther	001	006	There were hangings of white, green, and blue material,
Esther	001	007	They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds,
Esther	001	008	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory;
Esther	001	009	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
Esther	001	010	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry
Esther	001	011	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown,
Esther	001	012	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
Esther	001	013	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times,
Esther	001	014	and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,
Esther	001	015	"What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law,
Esther	001	016	Memucan answered before the king and the princes,
Esther	001	017	For this deed of the queen will become known to all women,
Esther	001	018	Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard
Esther	001	019	If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him,
Esther	001	020	When the king's decree which he shall make is published
Esther	001	021	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king
Esther	001	022	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
Esther	002	001	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified,
Esther	002	002	Then the king's servants who served him said, "Let beautiful
Esther	002	003	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
Esther	002	004	and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti."
Esther	002	005	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name
Esther	002	006	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives
Esther	002	007	He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter;
Esther	002	008	So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree
Esther	002	009	The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him.
Esther	002	010	Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives,
Esther	002	011	Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house,
Esther	002	012	Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after
Esther	002	013	The young woman then came to the king like this:  whatever she
Esther	002	014	In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned
Esther	002	015	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
Esther	002	016	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house
Esther	002	017	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained
Esther	002	018	Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants,
Esther	002	019	When the virgins were gathered together the second time,
Esther	002	020	Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people,
Esther	002	021	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate,
Esther	002	022	This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen;
Esther	002	023	When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so,
Esther	003	001	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son
Esther	003	002	All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down,
Esther	003	003	Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate,
Esther	003	004	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't
Esther	003	005	When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage,
Esther	003	006	But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone,
Esther	003	007	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth
Esther	003	008	Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people
Esther	003	009	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed;
Esther	003	010	The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman
Esther	003	011	The king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you,
Esther	003	012	Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month,
Esther	003	013	Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces,
Esther	003	014	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given
Esther	003	015	The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment,
Esther	004	001	Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore
Esther	004	002	He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed
Esther	004	003	In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his
Esther	004	004	Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this,
Esther	004	005	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs,
Esther	004	006	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was
Esther	004	007	Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact
Esther	004	008	He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
Esther	004	009	Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther	004	010	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:
Esther	004	011	"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces,
Esther	004	012	They told to Mordecai Esther's words.
Esther	004	013	Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, "Don't think
Esther	004	014	For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance
Esther	004	015	Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,
Esther	004	016	"Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan,
Esther	004	017	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
Esther	005	001	Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her
Esther	005	002	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,
Esther	005	003	Then the king asked her, "What would you like, queen Esther?  What is
Esther	005	004	Esther said, "If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman
Esther	005	005	Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done
Esther	005	006	The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is
Esther	005	007	Then Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is this.
Esther	005	008	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please
Esther	005	009	Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when
Esther	005	010	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home.
Esther	005	011	Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude
Esther	005	012	Haman also said, "Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with
Esther	005	013	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
Esther	005	014	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him,
Esther	006	001	On that night, the king couldn't sleep.  He commanded the book
Esther	006	002	It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
Esther	006	003	The king said, "What honor and dignity has been bestowed on
Esther	006	004	The king said, "Who is in the court?"  Now Haman had come into
Esther	006	005	The king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman stands in the court."
Esther	006	006	So Haman came in.  The king said to him, "What shall
Esther	006	007	Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,
Esther	006	008	let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear,
Esther	006	009	Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand
Esther	006	010	Then the king said to Haman, "Hurry and take the clothing and
Esther	006	011	Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
Esther	006	012	Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried
Esther	006	013	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything
Esther	006	014	While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came,
Esther	007	001	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther	007	002	The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet
Esther	007	003	Then Esther the queen answered, "If I have found favor in your sight,
Esther	007	004	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
Esther	007	005	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, "Who is he,
Esther	007	006	Esther said, "An adversary and an enemy, even this
Esther	007	007	The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went
Esther	007	008	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
Esther	007	009	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said,
Esther	007	010	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared
Esther	008	001	On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews'
Esther	008	002	The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
Esther	008	003	Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet,
Esther	008	004	Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter.
Esther	008	005	She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor
Esther	008	006	For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people?
Esther	008	007	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai
Esther	008	008	Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name,
Esther	008	009	Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third
Esther	008	010	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with
Esther	008	011	In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every
Esther	008	012	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth
Esther	008	013	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given
Esther	008	014	So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out,
Esther	008	015	Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal
Esther	008	016	The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.
Esther	008	017	In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment
Esther	009	001	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar,
Esther	009	002	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout
Esther	009	003	All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors,
Esther	009	004	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
Esther	009	005	The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword,
Esther	009	006	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed
Esther	009	007	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Esther	009	008	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
Esther	009	009	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
Esther	009	010	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy,
Esther	009	011	On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel
Esther	009	012	The king said to Esther the queen, "The Jews have slain
Esther	009	013	Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted
Esther	009	014	The king commanded this to be done.  A decree was given out
Esther	009	015	The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together
Esther	009	016	The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves
Esther	009	017	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar;
Esther	009	018	But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on
Esther	009	019	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns,
Esther	009	020	Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews
Esther	009	021	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth
Esther	009	022	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies,
Esther	009	023	The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai
Esther	009	024	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy
Esther	009	025	but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters
Esther	009	026	Therefore they called these days "Purim,{Purim is the Hebrew
Esther	009	027	the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on
Esther	009	028	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
Esther	009	029	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
Esther	009	030	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven
Esther	009	031	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times,
Esther	009	032	The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim;
Esther	010	001	King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands

Job	001	002	There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
Job	001	003	His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels,
Job	001	004	His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on
Job	001	005	It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course,
Job	001	006	Now it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present
Job	001	007	Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"
Job	001	008	Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant, Job?  For there
Job	001	009	Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does Job fear
Job	001	010	Haven't you made a hedge around him, and around his house,
Job	001	011	But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has,
Job	001	012	Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power.
Job	001	013	It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
Job	001	014	that there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen
Job	001	015	and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away.  Yes, they have

Job	001	019	and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck
Job	001	020	Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head,
Job	001	021	He said, "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall
Job	001	022	In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
Job	002	001	Again it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present
Job	002	002	Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"
Job	002	003	Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?  For there
Job	002	004	Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for skin.  Yes, all that
Job	002	005	But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
Job	002	006	Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand.
Job	002	007	So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job
Job	002	008	He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with,
Job	002	009	Then his wife said to him, "Do you still maintain your integrity?
Job	002	010	But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women
Job	002	011	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil
Job	002	012	When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn't

Job	003	001	After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.
Job	003	002	Job answered:
Job	003	003	"Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said,
Job	003	004	Let that day be darkness.  Don't let God from above seek for it,
Job	003	005	Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.
Job	003	006	As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.
Job	003	007	Behold, let that night be barren.  Let no joyful voice come therein.
Job	003	008	Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to
Job	003	009	Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark.  Let it look
Job	003	010	because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
Job	003	011	"Why didn't I die from the womb?  Why didn't I give up the spirit
Job	003	012	Why did the knees receive me?  Or why the breast,
Job	003	013	For now should I have lain down and been quiet.
Job	003	014	with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste
Job	003	015	or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

Job	003	020	"Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the
Job	003	021	Who long for death, but it doesn't come; and dig for it more
Job	003	022	who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can

Job	004	001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
Job	004	002	"If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?

Job	004	011	The old lion perishes for lack of prey.  The cubs of the lioness
Job	004	012	"Now a thing was secretly brought to me.  My ear received
Job	004	013	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
Job	004	014	fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
Job	004	015	Then a spirit passed before my face.  The hair of my

Job	004	017	'Shall mortal man be more just than God?  Shall a man be more
Job	004	018	Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.  He charges his
Job	004	019	How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
Job	004	020	Between morning and evening they are destroyed.
Job	004	021	Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them?  They die,

Job	005	005	whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns.
Job	005	006	For affliction doesn't come forth from the dust, neither does
Job	005	007	but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
Job	005	008	"But as for me, I would seek God.  I would commit my cause to God,
Job	005	009	who does great things that can't be fathomed, marvelous
Job	005	010	who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;
Job	005	011	so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn
Job	005	012	He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands
Job	005	013	He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel
Job	005	014	They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday
Job	005	015	But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy
Job	005	016	So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
Job	005	017	"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.  Therefore do
Job	005	018	For he wounds, and binds up.  He injures, and his hands make whole.
Job	005	019	He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven there shall
Job	005	020	In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power
Job	005	021	You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall
Job	005	022	At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you
Job	005	023	For you shall be in league with the stones of the field.
Job	005	024	You shall know that your tent is in peace.  You shall visit
Job	005	025	You shall know also that your seed shall be great, Your offspring
Job	005	026	You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock
Job	005	027	Look this, we have searched it, so it is.  Hear it, and know
Job	006	001	Then Job answered,
Job	006	002	"Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid
Job	006	003	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,
Job	006	004	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.  My spirit

Job	006	006	Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?
Job	006	007	My soul refuses to touch them.  They are as loathsome food to me.
Job	006	008	"Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing

Job	006	012	Is my strength the strength of stones?  Or is my flesh of brass?
Job	006	013	Isn't it that I have no help in me, That wisdom is driven

Job	006	015	My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel

Job	006	019	The caravans of Tema looked.  The companies of Sheba
Job	006	020	They were distressed because they were confident.
Job	006	021	For now you are nothing.  You see a terror, and are afraid.
Job	006	022	Did I say, 'Give to me?' or, 'Offer a present for me
Job	006	023	or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand?' or, 'Redeem me

Job	006	030	Is there injustice on my tongue?  Can't my taste
Job	007	001	"Isn't a man forced to labor on earth?  Aren't his days
Job	007	002	As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling
Job	007	003	so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights
Job	007	004	When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, and the night be gone?'
Job	007	005	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.
Job	007	006	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are
Job	007	007	Oh remember that my life is a breath.  My eye shall no
Job	007	008	The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more.
Job	007	009	As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes

Job	007	011	"Therefore I will not keep silent.  I will speak in the anguish

Job	007	015	so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.
Job	007	016	I loathe my life.  I don't want to live forever.
Job	007	017	What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set
Job	007	018	that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?
Job	007	019	How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone
Job	007	020	If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?
Job	007	021	Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?
Job	008	001	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
Job	008	002	"How long will you speak these things?  Shall the words of your
Job	008	003	Does God pervert justice?  Or does the Almighty
Job	008	004	If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered
Job	008	005	If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication
Job	008	006	If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you,
Job	008	007	Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end
Job	008	008	"Please inquire of past generations.  Find out about the learning

Job	008	013	So are the paths of all who forget God.  The hope of the godless
Job	008	014	Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider's web.
Job	008	015	He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand.
Job	008	016	He is green before the sun.  His shoots go forth over his garden.
Job	008	017	His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.  He sees
Job	008	018	If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him,

Job	008	021	He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.
Job	008	022	Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame.
Job	009	001	Then Job answered,
Job	009	002	"Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?
Job	009	003	If he is pleased to contend with him, he can't answer him
Job	009	004	God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
Job	009	005	He removes the mountains, and they don't know it, when he overturns
Job	009	006	He shakes the earth out of its place.  Its pillars tremble.
Job	009	007	He commands the sun, and it doesn't rise, and seals up the stars.
Job	009	008	He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves
Job	009	009	He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers
Job	009	010	He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous
Job	009	011	Behold, he goes by me, and I don't see him.  He passes on also,
Job	009	012	Behold, he snatches away.  Who can hinder him?  Who will ask him,
Job	009	013	"God will not withdraw his anger.  The helpers of Rahab
Job	009	014	How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to
Job	009	015	Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn't answer him.
Job	009	016	If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn't believe
Job	009	017	For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my
Job	009	018	He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills
Job	009	019	If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!
Job	009	020	Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me.
Job	009	021	I am blameless.  I don't regard myself.  I despise my life.
Job	009	022	"It is all the same.  Therefore I say he destroys the blameless
Job	009	023	If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial
Job	009	024	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
Job	009	025	"Now my days are swifter than a runner.  They flee away,
Job	009	026	They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that

Job	009	028	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not
Job	009	029	I shall be condemned.  Why then do I labor in vain?
Job	009	030	If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,
Job	009	031	yet you will plunge me in the ditch.  My own clothes
Job	009	032	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,

Job	009	034	Let him take his rod away from me.  Let his terror not
Job	009	035	then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.
Job	010	001	"My soul is weary of my life.  I will give free course to

Job	010	003	Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should

Job	010	005	Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man's years,
Job	010	006	that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?
Job	010	007	Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can

Job	010	009	Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.
Job	010	010	Haven't you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?
Job	010	011	You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together
Job	010	012	You have granted me life and loving kindness.  Your visitation
Job	010	013	Yet you hid these things in your heart.  I know that this
Job	010	014	if I sin, then you mark me.  You will not acquit me
Job	010	015	If I am wicked, woe to me.  If I am righteous, I still shall
Job	010	016	If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.
Job	010	017	You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation
Job	010	018	"'Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb?
Job	010	019	I should have been as though I had not been.  I should have

Job	010	021	before I go where I shall not return from, to the land
Job	010	022	the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order,
Job	011	001	Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
Job	011	002	"Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered?  Should a man
Job	011	003	Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
Job	011	004	For you say, 'My doctrine is pure.  I am clean in your eyes.'
Job	011	005	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you,
Job	011	006	that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!  For true wisdom
Job	011	007	"Can you fathom the mystery of God?  Or can you probe the limits
Job	011	008	They are high as heaven.  What can you do?  They are deeper
Job	011	009	Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
Job	011	010	If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who

Job	011	012	An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a

Job	011	014	If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.  Don't let
Job	011	015	Surely then shall you lift up your face without spot;
Job	011	016	for you shall forget your misery.  You shall remember it
Job	011	017	Life shall be clearer than the noonday.  Though there is darkness,
Job	011	018	You shall be secure, because there is hope.  Yes, you shall search,
Job	011	019	Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid.
Job	011	020	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.  They shall have no way
Job	012	001	Then Job answered,
Job	012	002	"No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
Job	012	003	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you.
Job	012	004	I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God,
Job	012	005	In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt
Job	012	006	The tents of robbers prosper.  Those who provoke God are secure,
Job	012	007	"But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you;
Job	012	008	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you.  The fish
Job	012	009	Who doesn't know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh
Job	012	010	in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath
Job	012	011	Doesn't the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?
Job	012	012	With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.
Job	012	013	"With God is wisdom and might.  He has counsel and understanding.
Job	012	014	Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again.
Job	012	015	Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up.  Again, he sends
Job	012	016	With him is strength and wisdom.  The deceived and the

Job	012	018	He loosens the bond of kings.  He binds their waist with a belt.
Job	012	019	He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.
Job	012	020	He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away
Job	012	021	He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.
Job	012	022	He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light
Job	012	023	He increases the nations, and he destroys them.
Job	012	024	He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people
Job	012	025	They grope in the dark without light.  He makes them stagger
Job	013	001	"Behold, my eye has seen all this.  My ear has heard
Job	013	002	What you know, I know also.  I am not inferior to you.
Job	013	003	"Surely I would speak to the Almighty.  I desire to reason with God.
Job	013	004	But you are forgers of lies.  You are all physicians of no value.
Job	013	005	Oh that you would be completely silent!  Then you would be wise.
Job	013	006	Hear now my reasoning.  Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job	013	007	Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?
Job	013	008	Will you show partiality to him?  Will you contend for God?
Job	013	009	Is it good that he should search you out?  Or as one deceives
Job	013	010	He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.
Job	013	011	Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?
Job	013	012	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses
Job	013	013	"Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak.  Let come on
Job	013	014	Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life
Job	013	015	Behold, he will kill me.  I have no hope.  Nevertheless, I will
Job	013	016	This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall
Job	013	017	Hear diligently my speech.  Let my declaration be in your ears.
Job	013	018	See now, I have set my cause in order.  I know that I am righteous.
Job	013	019	Who is he who will contend with me?  For then would I hold
Job	013	020	"Only don't do two things to me; then I will not hide myself
Job	013	021	withdraw your hand far from me; and don't let your terror
Job	013	022	Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me.
Job	013	023	How many are my iniquities and sins?  Make me know my disobedience
Job	013	024	Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?
Job	013	025	Will you harass a driven leaf?  Will you pursue the dry stubble?
Job	013	026	For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit
Job	013	027	You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths.
Job	013	028	though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment
Job	014	001	"Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.
Job	014	002	He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down.  He also flees
Job	014	003	Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into
Job	014	004	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?  Not one.
Job	014	005	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is
Job	014	006	Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish,
Job	014	007	"For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will

Job	014	009	yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth
Job	014	010	But man dies, and is laid low.  Yes, man gives up the spirit,
Job	014	011	As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,
Job	014	012	so man lies down and doesn't rise.  Until the heavens are no more,
Job	014	013	"Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret,
Job	014	014	If a man dies, shall he live again?  All the days of my warfare
Job	014	015	You would call, and I would answer you.  You would have a desire
Job	014	016	But now you number my steps.  Don't you watch over my sin?
Job	014	017	My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.  You fasten up my iniquity.
Job	014	018	"But the mountain falling comes to nothing.  The rock is removed
Job	014	019	The waters wear the stones.  The torrents of it wash away
Job	014	020	You forever prevail against him, and he departs.
Job	014	021	His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it.
Job	014	022	But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns."
Job	015	001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
Job	015	002	"Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself
Job	015	003	Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches
Job	015	004	Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.
Job	015	005	For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language
Job	015	006	Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips
Job	015	007	"Are you the first man who was born?  Or were you brought
Job	015	008	Have you heard the secret counsel of God?  Do you limit
Job	015	009	What do you know, that we don't know?  What do you understand,
Job	015	010	With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,
Job	015	011	Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word
Job	015	012	Why does your heart carry you away?  Why do your eyes flash,
Job	015	013	That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go
Job	015	014	What is man, that he should be clean?  What is he who is born
Job	015	015	Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.  Yes, the heavens
Job	015	016	how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks
Job	015	017	"I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen
Job	015	018	(Which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;
Job	015	019	to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):
Job	015	020	the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number
Job	015	021	A sound of terrors is in his ears.  In prosperity the destroyer
Job	015	022	He doesn't believe that he shall return out of darkness.
Job	015	023	He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?'
Job	015	024	Distress and anguish make him afraid.  They prevail against him,
Job	015	025	Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves
Job	015	026	he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields
Job	015	027	because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered
Job	015	028	He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited,
Job	015	029	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
Job	015	030	He shall not depart out of darkness.  The flame shall dry up
Job	015	031	Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness
Job	015	032	It shall be accomplished before his time.  His branch shall
Job	015	033	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall

Job	015	035	They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
Job	016	001	Then Job answered,
Job	016	002	"I have heard many such things.  You are all miserable comforters!
Job	016	003	Shall vain words have an end?  Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job	016	004	I also could speak as you do.  If your soul were in my
Job	016	005	but I would strengthen you with my mouth.  The solace of my
Job	016	006	"Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.  Though I forbear,
Job	016	007	But now, God, you have surely worn me out.  You have made
Job	016	008	You have shriveled me up.  This is a witness against me.
Job	016	009	He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me.
Job	016	010	They have gaped on me with their mouth.  They have struck
Job	016	011	God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands
Job	016	012	I was at ease, and he broke me apart.  Yes, he has taken me
Job	016	013	His archers surround me.  He splits my kidneys apart,
Job	016	014	He breaks me with breach on breach.  He runs on me like a giant.
Job	016	015	I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn
Job	016	016	My face is red with weeping.  Deep darkness is on my eyelids.
Job	016	017	Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
Job	016	018	"Earth, don't cover my blood.  Let my cry have no place to rest.
Job	016	019	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.  He who vouches
Job	016	020	My friends scoff at me.  My eyes pour out tears to God,
Job	016	021	that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son
Job	016	022	For when a few years are come, I shall go the way from whence
Job	017	001	"My spirit is consumed.  My days are extinct, And the grave
Job	017	002	Surely there are mockers with me.  My eye dwells
Job	017	003	"Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself.
Job	017	004	For you have hidden their heart from understanding,
Job	017	005	He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his
Job	017	006	"But he has made me a byword of the people.  They spit
Job	017	007	My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.  All my members are
Job	017	008	Upright men shall be astonished at this.  The innocent shall
Job	017	009	Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.  He who has clean
Job	017	010	But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise
Job	017	011	My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts
Job	017	012	They change the night into day, saying 'The light is near'
Job	017	013	If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch
Job	017	014	If I have said to corruption, 'You are my father;' to the worm,
Job	017	015	where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
Job	017	016	Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend
Job	018	001	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
Job	018	002	"How long will you hunt for words?  Consider, and afterwards
Job	018	003	Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean
Job	018	004	You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken
Job	018	005	"Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, The spark
Job	018	006	The light shall be dark in his tent.  His lamp above him shall
Job	018	007	The steps of his strength shall be shortened.  His own counsel
Job	018	008	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders
Job	018	009	A snare will take him by the heel.  A trap will catch him.
Job	018	010	A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him
Job	018	011	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase
Job	018	012	His strength shall be famished.  Calamity shall be ready
Job	018	013	The members of his body shall be devoured.  The firstborn
Job	018	014	He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts.
Job	018	015	There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his.
Job	018	016	His roots shall be dried up beneath.  Above shall his branch
Job	018	017	His memory shall perish from the earth.  He shall have no name
Job	018	018	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out
Job	018	019	He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people,
Job	018	020	Those who come after shall be astonished at his day,
Job	018	021	Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous.
Job	019	001	Then Job answered,
Job	019	002	"How long will you torment me, and crush me with words?
Job	019	003	You have reproached me ten times.  You aren't ashamed that
Job	019	004	If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself.
Job	019	005	If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
Job	019	006	know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me
Job	019	007	"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.
Job	019	008	He has walled up my way so that I can't pass, and has set
Job	019	009	He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
Job	019	010	He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.
Job	019	011	He has also kindled his wrath against me.  He counts me
Job	019	012	His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me,
Job	019	013	"He has put my brothers far from me.  My acquaintances are
Job	019	014	My relatives have gone away.  My familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job	019	015	Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger.
Job	019	016	I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.
Job	019	017	My breath is offensive to my wife.  I am loathsome to the children
Job	019	018	Even young children despise me.  If I arise, they speak against me.
Job	019	019	All my familiar friends abhor me.  They whom I loved have
Job	019	020	My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.  I have escaped
Job	019	021	"Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand
Job	019	022	Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied
Job	019	023	"Oh that my words were now written!  Oh that they were inscribed
Job	019	024	That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in
Job	019	025	But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.  In the end,
Job	019	026	After my skin is destroyed, then in my flesh shall I see God,
Job	019	027	Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.  My eyes shall see,
Job	019	028	If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' because the root
Job	019	029	be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments
Job	020	001	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
Job	020	002	"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason
Job	020	003	I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.
Job	020	004	Don't you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth,
Job	020	005	that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless
Job	020	006	Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach
Job	020	007	yet he shall perish forever like his own dung.
Job	020	008	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found.
Job	020	009	The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall
Job	020	010	His children shall seek the favor of the poor.  His hands
Job	020	011	His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down
Job	020	012	"Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
Job	020	013	though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still
Job	020	014	yet his food in his bowels is turned.  It is cobra venom within him.
Job	020	015	He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again.
Job	020	016	He shall suck cobra venom.  The viper's tongue shall kill him.
Job	020	017	He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of
Job	020	018	That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow
Job	020	019	For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.  He has violently
Job	020	020	"Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save
Job	020	021	There was nothing left that he didn't devour, therefore his
Job	020	022	In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him.
Job	020	023	When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness
Job	020	024	He shall flee from the iron weapon.  The bronze arrow shall
Job	020	025	He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body.
Job	020	026	All darkness is laid up for his treasures.  An unfanned fire
Job	020	027	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity.  The earth shall rise
Job	020	028	The increase of his house shall depart.  They shall rush away
Job	020	029	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage
Job	021	001	Then Job answered,
Job	021	002	"Listen diligently to my speech.  Let this be your consolation.
Job	021	003	Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on.
Job	021	004	As for me, is my complaint to man?  Why shouldn't I be impatient?
Job	021	005	Look at me, and be astonished.  Lay your hand on your mouth.
Job	021	006	When I remember, I am troubled.  Horror takes hold of my flesh.
Job	021	007	"Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?
Job	021	008	Their child is established with them in their sight,
Job	021	009	Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of
Job	021	010	Their bulls breed without fail.  Their cows calve,
Job	021	011	They send forth their little ones like a flock.
Job	021	012	They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound
Job	021	013	They spend their days in prosperity.  In an instant they go
Job	021	014	They tell God, 'Depart from us, for we don't want to know
Job	021	015	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
Job	021	016	Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.  The counsel
Job	021	017	"How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
Job	021	018	How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,
Job	021	019	You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.'
Job	021	020	Let his own eyes see his destruction.  Let him drink of the wrath
Job	021	021	For what does he care for his house after him, when the number
Job	021	022	"Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those
Job	021	023	One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
Job	021	024	His pails are full of milk.  The marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job	021	025	Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.
Job	021	026	They lie down alike in the dust.  The worm covers them.
Job	021	027	"Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you
Job	021	028	For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince?
Job	021	029	Haven't you asked wayfaring men?  Don't you know their evidences,
Job	021	030	that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,
Job	021	031	Who shall declare his way to his face?  Who shall repay him
Job	021	032	Yet he will be borne to the grave.  Men shall keep watch
Job	021	033	The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.  All men shall
Job	021	034	So how can you comfort me with nonsense, seeing that in your
Job	022	001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
Job	022	002	"Can a man be profitable to God?  Surely he who is wise is
Job	022	003	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?
Job	022	004	Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters
Job	022	005	Isn't your wickedness great?  Neither is there any end
Job	022	006	For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,
Job	022	007	You haven't given water to the weary to drink, and you have
Job	022	008	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.  The honorable man,
Job	022	009	You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless
Job	022	010	Therefore snares are round about you.  Sudden fear troubles you,
Job	022	011	or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you.
Job	022	012	"Isn't God in the heights of heaven?  See the height of the stars,
Job	022	013	You say, 'What does God know?  Can he judge through
Job	022	014	Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn't see.
Job	022	015	Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden,
Job	022	016	who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation
Job	022	017	who said to God, 'Depart from us;' and, 'What can the Almighty
Job	022	018	Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel
Job	022	019	The righteous see it, and are glad.  The innocent ridicule them,
Job	022	020	saying, 'Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.
Job	022	021	"Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.
Job	022	022	Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words
Job	022	023	If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, if you
Job	022	024	Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones
Job	022	025	The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you.
Job	022	026	For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and shall
Job	022	027	You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.
Job	022	028	You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you.
Job	022	029	When they cast down, you shall say, 'be lifted up.'
Job	022	030	He will even deliver him who is not innocent.  Yes, he shall
Job	023	001	Then Job answered,
Job	023	002	"Even today my complaint is rebellious.  His hand is heavy
Job	023	003	Oh that I knew where I might find him!  That I might come
Job	023	004	I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my
Job	023	005	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
Job	023	006	Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
Job	023	007	There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered
Job	023	008	"If I go east, he is not there; if west, I can't find him;
Job	023	009	He works to the north, but I can't see him.  He turns south,
Job	023	010	But he knows the way that I take.  When he has tried me,
Job	023	011	My foot has held fast to his steps.  I have kept his way,
Job	023	012	I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips.
Job	023	013	But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?  What his soul desires,
Job	023	014	For he performs that which is appointed for me.
Job	023	015	Therefore I am terrified at his presence.  When I consider,
Job	023	016	For God has made my heart faint.  The Almighty has terrified me.
Job	023	017	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did
Job	024	001	"Why aren't times laid up by the Almighty?  Why don't those
Job	024	002	There are people who remove the landmarks.  They violently
Job	024	003	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, and they take
Job	024	004	They turn the needy out of the way.  The poor of the earth
Job	024	005	Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, they go forth to their work,
Job	024	006	They cut their provender in the field.  They glean the vineyard
Job	024	007	They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering
Job	024	008	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
Job	024	009	There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,
Job	024	010	So that they go around naked without clothing.  Being hungry,
Job	024	011	They make oil within the walls of these men.  They tread
Job	024	012	From out of the populous city, men groan.  The soul of the wounded
Job	024	013	"These are of those who rebel against the light.
Job	024	014	The murderer rises with the light.  He kills the poor and needy.
Job	024	015	The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying,
Job	024	016	In the dark they dig through houses.  They shut themselves up
Job	024	017	For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,
Job	024	018	"They are foam on the surface of the waters.  Their portion
Job	024	019	Drought and heat consume the snow waters, so does Sheol
Job	024	020	The womb shall forget him.  The worm shall feed sweetly on him.
Job	024	021	He devours the barren who don't bear.  He shows no kindness
Job	024	022	Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.  He rises up who has
Job	024	023	God gives them security, and they rest in it.  His eyes are
Job	024	024	They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.
Job	024	025	If it isn't so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my
Job	025	001	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
Job	025	002	"Dominion and fear are with him.  He makes peace in his high places.
Job	025	003	Can his armies be counted?  On whom does his light not arise?
Job	025	004	How then can man be just with God?  Or how can he who is born
Job	025	005	Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are
Job	025	006	How much less man, who is a worm, the son of man, who is a worm!"
Job	026	001	Then Job answered,
Job	026	002	"How have you helped him who is without power!  How have you
Job	026	003	How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully
Job	026	004	To whom have you uttered words?  Whose spirit came forth from you?
Job	026	005	"Those who are deceased tremble, those beneath the waters
Job	026	006	Sheol{Sheol is the lower world or the grave.} is naked before God,
Job	026	007	He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs
Job	026	008	He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud
Job	026	009	He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.
Job	026	010	He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,
Job	026	011	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.
Job	026	012	He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding
Job	026	013	By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.  His hand has pierced
Job	026	014	Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.
Job	027	001	Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job	027	002	"As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty,
Job	027	003	(For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit
Job	027	004	surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall
Job	027	005	Far be it from me that I should justify you.  Until I die I
Job	027	006	I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.
Job	027	007	"Let my enemy be as the wicked.  Let him who rises up against
Job	027	008	For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,
Job	027	009	Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
Job	027	010	Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God
Job	027	011	I will teach you about the hand of God.  That which is with
Job	027	012	Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you
Job	027	013	"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage
Job	027	014	If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.
Job	027	015	Those who remain of him shall be buried in death.
Job	027	016	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing
Job	027	017	he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent
Job	027	018	He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes.
Job	027	019	He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again.
Job	027	020	Terrors overtake him like waters.  A storm steals him away
Job	027	021	The east wind carries him away, and he departs.
Job	027	022	For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away
Job	027	023	Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out
Job	028	001	"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold
Job	028	002	Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out
Job	028	003	Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound,
Job	028	004	He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.
Job	028	005	As for the earth, out of it comes bread; Underneath it is turned
Job	028	006	Sapphires come from its rocks.  It has dust of gold.
Job	028	007	That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon's
Job	028	008	The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion
Job	028	009	He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns
Job	028	010	He cuts out channels among the rocks.  His eye sees
Job	028	011	He binds the streams that they don't trickle.  The thing
Job	028	012	"But where shall wisdom be found?  Where is the place
Job	028	013	Man doesn't know its price; Neither is it found in the land
Job	028	014	The deep says, 'It isn't in me.'  The sea says, 'It isn't with me.'
Job	028	015	It can't be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
Job	028	016	It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx,
Job	028	017	Gold and glass can't equal it, neither shall it be exchanged
Job	028	018	No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal.  Yes, the price
Job	028	019	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it
Job	028	020	Whence then comes wisdom?  Where is the place of understanding?
Job	028	021	Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept
Job	028	022	Destruction and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it
Job	028	023	"God understands its way, and he knows its place.
Job	028	024	For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under

Job	028	026	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
Job	028	027	then he saw it, and declared it.  He established it, yes,
Job	028	028	To man he said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.
Job	029	001	Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job	029	002	"Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God
Job	029	003	when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I
Job	029	004	as I was in the ripeness of my days, when the friendship of God
Job	029	005	when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me,
Job	029	006	when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured
Job	029	007	when I went forth to the city gate, when I prepared my seat
Job	029	008	The young men saw me and hid themselves.  The aged rose
Job	029	009	The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand
Job	029	010	The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck
Job	029	011	For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
Job	029	012	Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also,
Job	029	013	the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,
Job	029	014	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.  My justice was
Job	029	015	I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.
Job	029	016	I was a father to the needy.  The cause of him who I didn't know,
Job	029	017	I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey
Job	029	018	Then I said, 'I shall die in my own house, I shall number
Job	029	019	My root is spread out to the waters.  The dew lies all night
Job	029	020	My glory is fresh in me.  My bow is renewed in my hand.'
Job	029	021	"Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel.
Job	029	022	After my words they didn't speak again.  My speech fell on them.
Job	029	023	They waited for me as for the rain.  Their mouths drank
Job	029	024	I smiled on them when they had no confidence.  They didn't
Job	029	025	I chose out their way, and sat as chief.  I lived as a king
Job	030	001	"But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,
Job	030	002	Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom

Job	030	004	They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.  The roots of the broom
Job	030	005	They are driven out from the midst of men.  They cry after them
Job	030	006	So that they dwell in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth
Job	030	007	Among the bushes they bray; and under the nettles they
Job	030	008	They are children of fools, yes, children of base men.
Job	030	009	"Now I have become their song.  Yes, I am a byword to them.
Job	030	010	They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don't hesitate
Job	030	011	For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have
Job	030	012	On my right hand rise the rabble.  They thrust aside my feet,
Job	030	013	They mar my path, They set forward my calamity,
Job	030	014	As through a wide breach they come, in the midst of the ruin
Job	030	015	Terrors have turned on me.  They chase my honor as the wind.
Job	030	016	"Now my soul is poured out within me.  Days of affliction
Job	030	017	In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains
Job	030	018	By great force is my garment disfigured.  It binds me about
Job	030	019	He has cast me into the mire.  I have become like dust and ashes.
Job	030	020	I cry to you, and you do not answer me.  I stand up, and you
Job	030	021	You have turned to be cruel to me.  With the might of your hand
Job	030	022	You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.
Job	030	023	For I know that you will bring me to death, To the house
Job	030	024	"However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall?
Job	030	025	Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble?  Wasn't my soul
Job	030	026	When I looked for good, then evil came; When I waited for light,
Job	030	027	My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest.  Days of affliction
Job	030	028	I go mourning without the sun.  I stand up in the assembly,
Job	030	029	I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.
Job	030	030	My skin grows black and peels from me.  My bones are
Job	030	031	Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into
Job	031	001	"I made a covenant with my eyes, how then should I look
Job	031	002	For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage
Job	031	003	Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the
Job	031	004	Doesn't he see my ways, and number all my steps?
Job	031	005	"If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit
Job	031	006	(let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may

Job	031	009	"If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait
Job	031	010	then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her.
Job	031	011	For that would be a heinous crime.  Yes, it would be an iniquity
Job	031	012	For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root
Job	031	013	"If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my
Job	031	014	What then shall I do when God rises up?  When he visits,
Job	031	015	Didn't he who made me in the womb make him?  Didn't one fashion
Job	031	016	"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
Job	031	017	or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not
Job	031	018	(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
Job	031	019	if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy

Job	031	021	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I

Job	031	023	For calamity from God is a terror to me.  Because his majesty,
Job	031	024	"If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold,
Job	031	025	If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my

Job	031	027	and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw
Job	031	028	this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
Job	031	029	"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,
Job	031	030	(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life
Job	031	031	if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find one who has
Job	031	032	(the foreigner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened
Job	031	033	if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding
Job	031	034	because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt
Job	031	035	oh that I had one to hear me! (behold, here is my signature,

Job	031	038	If my land cries out against me, and the furrows of it weep together;
Job	031	039	if I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused
Job	031	040	let briars grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley."
Job	032	001	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
Job	032	002	Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite,
Job	032	003	Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends,
Job	032	004	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were
Job	032	005	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
Job	032	006	Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, "I am young,
Job	032	007	I said, 'Days should speak, and multitude of years
Job	032	008	But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty
Job	032	009	It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged
Job	032	010	Therefore I said, 'Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.'
Job	032	011	"Behold, I waited for your words, and I listened for your reasoning,
Job	032	012	Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who
Job	032	013	Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom, God may refute
Job	032	014	for he has not directed his words against me; neither will I
Job	032	015	"They are amazed.  They answer no more.  They don't have
Job	032	016	Shall I wait, because they don't speak, because they stand still,
Job	032	017	I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion.
Job	032	018	For I am full of words.  The spirit within me constrains me.
Job	032	019	Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new
Job	032	020	I will speak, that I may be refreshed.  I will open my
Job	032	021	Please don't let me respect any man's person, neither will I
Job	032	022	For I don't know how to give flattering titles; or else my Maker
Job	033	001	"However, Job, Please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.
Job	033	002	See now, I have opened my mouth.  My tongue has spoken
Job	033	003	My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart.
Job	033	004	The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty
Job	033	005	If you can, answer me.  Set your words in order before me,
Job	033	006	Behold, I am toward God even as you are.  I am also formed
Job	033	007	Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall
Job	033	008	"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice
Job	033	009	'I am clean, without disobedience.  I am innocent, neither is
Job	033	010	Behold, he finds occasions against me.  He counts me for his enemy.
Job	033	011	He puts my feet in the stocks.  He marks all my paths.'
Job	033	012	"Behold, I will answer you.  In this you are not just,
Job	033	013	Why do you strive against him, because he doesn't give account
Job	033	014	For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.
Job	033	015	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls
Job	033	016	Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,
Job	033	017	That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
Job	033	018	He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing
Job	033	019	He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual
Job	033	020	So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.
Job	033	021	His flesh is so consumed away, that it can't be seen.
Job	033	022	Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.
Job	033	023	"If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among
Job	033	024	then God is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going
Job	033	025	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days
Job	033	026	He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees
Job	033	027	He sings before men, and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted
Job	033	028	He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.
Job	033	029	"Behold, God works all these things, twice, yes three times,
Job	033	030	to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened
Job	033	031	Mark well, Job, and listen to me.  Hold your peace,
Job	033	032	If you have anything to say, answer me.  Speak, for I desire
Job	033	033	If not, listen to me.  Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
Job	034	001	Moreover Elihu answered,
Job	034	002	"Hear my words, you wise men.  Give ear to me,
Job	034	003	For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food.
Job	034	004	Let us choose for us that which is right.  Let us know among
Job	034	005	For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God has taken away my right:
Job	034	006	Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.
Job	034	007	What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,
Job	034	008	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks
Job	034	009	For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should
Job	034	010	"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:  far be it
Job	034	011	For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every
Job	034	012	Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the
Job	034	013	Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who has appointed
Job	034	014	If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself
Job	034	015	all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
Job	034	016	"If now you have understanding, hear this.  Listen to the voice
Job	034	017	Shall even one who hates justice govern?  Will you condemn
Job	034	018	Who says to a king, 'Vile!' or to nobles, 'Wicked!'?
Job	034	019	Who doesn't respect the persons of princes, nor regards the rich
Job	034	020	In a moment they die, even at midnight.  The people are shaken
Job	034	021	"For his eyes are on the ways of a man.  He sees all his goings.
Job	034	022	There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers
Job	034	023	For he doesn't need to consider a man further, that he should
Job	034	024	He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,
Job	034	025	Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.  He overturns
Job	034	026	He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job	034	027	because they turned aside from following him, and wouldn't
Job	034	028	so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.
Job	034	029	When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?  When he hides
Job	034	030	that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one
Job	034	031	"For has any said to God, 'I am guilty, but I will not
Job	034	032	Teach me that which I don't see.  If I have done iniquity,
Job	034	033	Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?
Job	034	034	Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man
Job	034	035	'Job speaks without knowledge.  His words are without wisdom.'
Job	034	036	I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering
Job	034	037	For he adds rebellion to his sin.  He claps his hands among us,
Job	035	001	Moreover Elihu answered,
Job	035	002	"Do you think this to be your right, or do you say,
Job	035	003	That you ask, 'What advantage will it be to you?
Job	035	004	I will answer you, and your companions with you.
Job	035	005	Look to the heavens, and see.  See the skies, which are
Job	035	006	If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?
Job	035	007	If you are righteous, what do you give him?  Or what does
Job	035	008	Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness
Job	035	009	"By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.
Job	035	010	But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs
Job	035	011	who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes
Job	035	012	There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride
Job	035	013	Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the
Job	035	014	How much less when you say you don't see him.  The cause
Job	035	015	But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does
Job	035	016	Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies
Job	036	001	Elihu also continued, and said,
Job	036	002	"Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still
Job	036	003	I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness
Job	036	004	For truly my words are not false.  One who is perfect in knowledge
Job	036	005	"Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't despise anyone.
Job	036	006	He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to
Job	036	007	He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings
Job	036	008	If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the
Job	036	009	then he shows them their work, and their transgressions,
Job	036	010	He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they
Job	036	011	If they listen and serve him, they shall spend their days
Job	036	012	But if they don't listen, they shall perish by the sword;
Job	036	013	"But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.
Job	036	014	They die in youth.  Their life perishes among the unclean.
Job	036	015	He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens
Job	036	016	Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a broad place,
Job	036	017	"But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.
Job	036	018	Don't let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great
Job	036	019	Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might
Job	036	020	Don't desire the night, when people are cut off in their place.
Job	036	021	Take heed, don't regard iniquity; for you have chosen this
Job	036	022	Behold, God is exalted in his power.  Who is a teacher like him?
Job	036	023	Who has prescribed his way for him?  Or who can say,
Job	036	024	"Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung.
Job	036	025	All men have looked thereon.  Man sees it afar off.
Job	036	026	Behold, God is great, and we don't know him.  The number
Job	036	027	For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain
Job	036	028	Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.
Job	036	029	Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,
Job	036	030	Behold, he spreads his light around him.  He covers the bottom
Job	036	031	For by these he judges the people.  He gives food in abundance.
Job	036	032	He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it
Job	036	033	Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also concerning
Job	037	001	"Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place.
Job	037	002	Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes
Job	037	003	He sends it forth under the whole sky, and his lightning
Job	037	004	After it a voice roars.  He thunders with the voice of his majesty.
Job	037	005	God thunders marvelously with his voice.  He does great things,
Job	037	006	For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth;' likewise to
Job	037	007	He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has
Job	037	008	Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens.
Job	037	009	Out of its chamber comes the storm, and cold out of the north.
Job	037	010	By the breath of God, ice is given, and the breadth of the
Job	037	011	Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.  He spreads abroad
Job	037	012	It is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do
Job	037	013	Whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness,
Job	037	014	"Listen to this, Job.  Stand still, and consider the wondrous
Job	037	015	Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning
Job	037	016	Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works
Job	037	017	You whose clothing is warm, when the earth is still by reason
Job	037	018	Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a
Job	037	019	Teach us what we shall tell him, for we can't make our case
Job	037	020	Shall it be told him that I would speak?  Or should a man wish
Job	037	021	Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies,
Job	037	022	Out of the north comes golden splendor.  With God is awesome majesty.
Job	037	023	We can't reach the Almighty.  He is exalted in power.
Job	037	024	Therefore men revere him.  He doesn't regard any who are
Job	038	001	Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,
Job	038	002	"Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
Job	038	003	Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you,
Job	038	004	"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Job	038	005	Who determined the measures of it, if you know?
Job	038	006	Whereupon were the foundations of it fastened?
Job	038	007	when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
Job	038	008	"Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth
Job	038	009	when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness,
Job	038	010	marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors,
Job	038	011	and said, 'Here you may come, but no further.  Here shall
Job	038	012	"Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused
Job	038	013	that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake
Job	038	014	It is changed as clay under the seal, and stands forth
Job	038	015	From the wicked, their light is withheld.  The high arm is broken.
Job	038	016	"Have you entered into the springs of the sea?  Or have you
Job	038	017	Have the gates of death been revealed to you?  Or have you
Job	038	018	Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth?  Declare, if you
Job	038	019	"What is the way to the dwelling of light?  As for darkness,
Job	038	020	that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern
Job	038	021	Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your
Job	038	022	Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen
Job	038	023	which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day
Job	038	024	By what way is the lightning distributed, or the east wind
Job	038	025	Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path
Job	038	026	To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness,
Job	038	027	to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender
Job	038	028	Does the rain have a father?  Or who fathers the drops of dew?
Job	038	029	Out of whose womb came the ice?  The gray frost of the sky,
Job	038	030	The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the
Job	038	031	"Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen
Job	038	032	Can you lead forth the constellations in their season?
Job	038	033	Do you know the laws of the heavens?  Can you establish
Job	038	034	"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance
Job	038	035	Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go?
Job	038	036	Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?  Or who has given
Job	038	037	Who can number the clouds by wisdom?  Or who can pour out
Job	038	038	when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of
Job	038	039	"Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite
Job	038	040	when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket?
Job	038	041	Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry
Job	039	001	"Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
Job	039	002	Can you number the months that they fulfill?  Or do you know
Job	039	003	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end
Job	039	004	Their young ones become strong.  They grow up in the open field.
Job	039	005	"Who has set the wild donkey free?  Or who has loosened
Job	039	006	Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land
Job	039	007	He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear
Job	039	008	The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after
Job	039	009	"Will the wild ox be content to serve you?  Or will he stay
Job	039	010	Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?
Job	039	011	Will you trust him, because his strength is great?
Job	039	012	Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,
Job	039	013	"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers
Job	039	014	For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust,
Job	039	015	and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
Job	039	016	She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.
Job	039	017	because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted
Job	039	018	When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse
Job	039	019	"Have you given the horse might?  Have you clothed his neck
Job	039	020	Have you made him to leap as a locust?  The glory of his

Job	039	022	He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn
Job	039	023	The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.
Job	039	024	He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does
Job	039	025	As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, 'Aha!'  He smells
Job	039	026	"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her
Job	039	027	Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes
Job	039	028	On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point
Job	039	029	From there he spies out the prey.  His eyes see it afar off.
Job	039	030	His young ones also suck up blood.  Where the slain are,
Job	040	001	Moreover Yahweh answered Job,
Job	040	002	"Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?  He who argues
Job	040	003	Then Job answered Yahweh,
Job	040	004	"Behold, I am of small account.  What shall I answer you?
Job	040	005	I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I
Job	040	006	Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,
Job	040	007	"Now brace yourself like a man.  I will question you, and you

Psalms	078	002	I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark
Psalms	078	003	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

Psalms	078	011	They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.
Psalms	078	012	He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,
Psalms	078	013	He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.
Psalms	078	014	In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night
Psalms	078	015	He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly
Psalms	078	016	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters

Psalms	078	022	because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust
Psalms	078	023	Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
Psalms	078	024	He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food
Psalms	078	025	Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.
Psalms	078	026	He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power
Psalms	078	027	He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds
Psalms	078	028	He let them fall in the midst of their camp,
Psalms	078	029	So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.

Psalms	078	034	When he killed them, then they inquired after him.
Psalms	078	035	They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God,
Psalms	078	036	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him
Psalms	078	037	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
Psalms	078	038	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them.
Psalms	078	039	He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away,
Psalms	078	040	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
Psalms	078	041	They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the
Psalms	078	042	They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed
Psalms	078	043	how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,
Psalms	078	044	he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams,
Psalms	078	045	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
Psalms	078	046	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor
Psalms	078	047	He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig
Psalms	078	048	He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks
Psalms	078	049	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation,
Psalms	078	050	He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul
Psalms	078	051	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their
Psalms	078	052	But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them
Psalms	078	053	He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea

Psalms	078	056	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
Psalms	078	057	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.
Psalms	078	058	For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
Psalms	078	059	When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms	078	060	So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he

Psalms	078	064	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
Psalms	078	065	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man
Psalms	078	066	He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to
Psalms	078	067	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose
Psalms	078	068	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms	078	069	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth
Psalms	078	070	He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
Psalms	078	071	from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be

Psalms	093	004	Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea,
Psalms	093	005	Your statutes stand firm.  Holiness adorns your house,
Psalms	094	001	Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom
Psalms	094	002	Rise up, you judge of the earth.  Pay back the proud
Psalms	094	003	Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
Psalms	094	004	They pour out arrogant words.  All the evil-doers boast.
Psalms	094	005	They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.
Psalms	094	006	They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
Psalms	094	007	They say, "Yah will not see, neither will Jacob's God consider."
Psalms	094	008	Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools,
Psalms	094	009	He who implanted the ear, won't he hear?  He who formed the eye,
Psalms	094	010	He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish?
Psalms	094	011	Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
Psalms	094	012	Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out
Psalms	094	013	that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,
Psalms	094	014	For Yahweh won't reject his people, neither will he
Psalms	094	015	For judgment will return to righteousness.  All the upright
Psalms	094	016	Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand
Psalms	094	017	Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon
Psalms	094	018	When I said, "My foot is slipping!"  Your loving kindness,

Psalms	104	008	The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place
Psalms	104	009	You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;

Psalms	105	005	Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders,
Psalms	105	006	you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob,
Psalms	105	007	He is Yahweh, our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms	105	008	He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded
Psalms	105	009	the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,
Psalms	105	010	and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel
Psalms	105	011	saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot

Psalms	105	022	to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach
Psalms	105	023	Israel also came into Egypt.  Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	024	He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger
Psalms	105	025	He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire
Psalms	105	026	He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
Psalms	105	027	They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	028	He sent darkness, and made it dark.  They didn't rebel
Psalms	105	029	He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
Psalms	105	030	Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
Psalms	105	031	He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
Psalms	105	032	He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
Psalms	105	033	He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered
Psalms	105	034	He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
Psalms	105	035	ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit

Psalms	105	041	He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.  They ran as a river
Psalms	105	042	For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.
Psalms	105	043	He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.
Psalms	105	044	He gave them the lands of the nations.  They took the labor
Psalms	105	045	that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws.
Psalms	106	001	Praise Yahweh!  Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
Psalms	106	002	Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare
Psalms	106	003	Blessed are those who keep justice.  Blessed is one who does

Psalms	106	005	that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may
Psalms	106	006	We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity.
Psalms	106	007	Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't
Psalms	106	008	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might

Psalms	106	011	The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one
Psalms	106	012	Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.
Psalms	106	013	They soon forgot his works.  They didn't wait for his counsel,
Psalms	106	014	but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God
Psalms	106	015	He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
Psalms	106	016	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
Psalms	106	017	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered
Psalms	106	018	A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned
Psalms	106	019	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
Psalms	106	020	Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull
Psalms	106	021	They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalms	106	022	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by
Psalms	106	023	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses,
Psalms	106	024	Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,
Psalms	106	025	but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
Psalms	106	026	Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them
Psalms	106	027	that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
Psalms	106	028	They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices
Psalms	106	029	Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.
Psalms	106	030	Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the
Psalms	106	031	That was credited to him for righteousness, for all
Psalms	106	032	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses
Psalms	106	033	because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke
Psalms	106	034	They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
Psalms	106	035	but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
Psalms	106	036	They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
Psalms	106	037	Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
Psalms	106	038	They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
Psalms	106	039	Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted
Psalms	106	040	Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.
Psalms	106	041	He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated
Psalms	106	042	Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into
Psalms	106	043	Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious
Psalms	106	044	Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
Psalms	106	045	He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
Psalms	106	046	He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
Psalms	106	047	Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations,

Psalms	107	003	And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west,
Psalms	107	004	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
Psalms	107	005	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Psalms	107	006	Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered
Psalms	107	007	he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city
Psalms	107	008	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
Psalms	107	009	For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry
Psalms	107	010	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
Psalms	107	011	because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned
Psalms	107	012	Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.
Psalms	107	013	Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them
Psalms	107	014	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
Psalms	107	015	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
Psalms	107	016	For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
Psalms	107	017	Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because
Psalms	107	018	Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to
Psalms	107	019	Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, he saves them out
Psalms	107	020	He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them
Psalms	107	021	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
Psalms	107	022	Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare
Psalms	107	023	Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business
Psalms	107	024	These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.
Psalms	107	025	For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts
Psalms	107	026	They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
Psalms	107	027	They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
Psalms	107	028	Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them
Psalms	107	029	He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
Psalms	107	030	Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them
Psalms	107	031	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
Psalms	107	032	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
Psalms	107	033	He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
Psalms	107	034	and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness
Psalms	107	035	He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land
Psalms	107	036	There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city
Psalms	107	037	sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
Psalms	107	038	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
Psalms	107	039	Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression,
Psalms	107	040	He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander
Psalms	107	041	Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases
Psalms	107	042	The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will

Proverbs	001	001	The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs	001	002	to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
Proverbs	001	003	to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness,
Proverbs	001	004	to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion
Proverbs	001	005	that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
Proverbs	001	006	to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles
Proverbs	001	007	The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish
Proverbs	001	008	My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake
Proverbs	001	009	for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains
Proverbs	001	010	My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.
Proverbs	001	011	If they say, "Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood;
Proverbs	001	012	let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those
Proverbs	001	013	We'll find all valuable wealth.  We'll fill our houses with spoil.
Proverbs	001	014	You shall cast your lot among us.  We'll all have one purse."
Proverbs	001	015	My son, don't walk in the way with them.  Keep your foot
Proverbs	001	016	for their feet run to evil.  They hurry to shed blood.
Proverbs	001	017	For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
Proverbs	001	018	but these lay wait for their own blood.  They lurk secretly
Proverbs	001	019	So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
Proverbs	001	020	Wisdom calls aloud in the street.  She utters her voice
Proverbs	001	021	She calls at the head of noisy places.  At the entrance
Proverbs	001	022	"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
Proverbs	001	023	Turn at my reproof.  Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
Proverbs	001	024	Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched
Proverbs	001	025	but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;
Proverbs	001	026	I also will laugh at your disaster.  I will mock when
Proverbs	001	027	when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes
Proverbs	001	028	Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.
Proverbs	001	029	because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
Proverbs	001	030	They wanted none of my counsel.  They despised all my reproof.
Proverbs	001	031	Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
Proverbs	001	032	For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
Proverbs	001	033	But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease,
Proverbs	002	001	My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my
Proverbs	002	002	So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your

Proverbs	002	006	For Yahweh gives wisdom.  Out of his mouth comes
Proverbs	002	007	He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.  He is a shield
Proverbs	002	008	that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way
Proverbs	002	009	Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and
Proverbs	002	010	For wisdom will enter into your heart.  Knowledge will be
Proverbs	002	011	Discretion will watch over you.  Understanding will keep you,
Proverbs	002	012	to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who
Proverbs	002	013	who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs	002	014	who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;
Proverbs	002	015	who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
Proverbs	002	016	To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner
Proverbs	002	017	who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant
Proverbs	002	018	for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.
Proverbs	002	019	None who go to her return again, neither do they attain
Proverbs	002	020	that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
Proverbs	002	021	For the upright will dwell in the land.  The perfect will
Proverbs	002	022	But the wicked will be cut off from the land.  The treacherous

Proverbs	003	006	In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
Proverbs	003	007	Don't be wise in your own eyes.  Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
Proverbs	003	008	It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.
Proverbs	003	009	Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits
Proverbs	003	010	so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will
Proverbs	003	011	My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, neither be weary
Proverbs	003	012	for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves
Proverbs	003	013	Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.
Proverbs	003	014	For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her
Proverbs	003	015	She is more precious than rubies.  None of the things you can
Proverbs	003	016	Length of days is in her right hand.  In her left hand are
Proverbs	003	017	Her ways are ways of pleasantness.  All her paths are peace.
Proverbs	003	018	She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.
Proverbs	003	019	By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.  By understanding,
Proverbs	003	020	By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies
Proverbs	003	021	My son, let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep sound
Proverbs	003	022	so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.
Proverbs	003	023	Then you shall walk in your way securely.  Your foot won't stumble.
Proverbs	003	024	When you lie down, you will not be afraid.  Yes, you will lie down,
Proverbs	003	025	Don't be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation
Proverbs	003	026	for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot
Proverbs	003	027	Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it
Proverbs	003	028	Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again; tomorrow I
Proverbs	003	029	Don't devise evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells
Proverbs	003	030	Don't strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
Proverbs	003	031	Don't envy the man of violence.  Choose none of his ways.
Proverbs	003	032	For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship
Proverbs	003	033	Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses
Proverbs	003	034	Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.
Proverbs	003	035	The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion
Proverbs	004	001	Listen, sons, to a father's instruction.  Pay attention
Proverbs	004	002	for I give you sound learning.  Don't forsake my law.
Proverbs	004	003	For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child
Proverbs	004	004	He taught me, and said to me:  "Let your heart retain my words.
Proverbs	004	005	Get wisdom.  Get understanding.  Don't forget, neither swerve
Proverbs	004	006	Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you.  Love her,
Proverbs	004	007	Wisdom is supreme.  Get wisdom.  Yes, though it costs all
Proverbs	004	008	Esteem her, and she will exalt you.  She will bring you to honor,
Proverbs	004	009	She will give to your head a garland of grace.  She will deliver
Proverbs	004	010	Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.  The years of your life
Proverbs	004	011	I have taught you in the way of wisdom.  I have led you
Proverbs	004	012	When you go, your steps will not be hampered.  When you run,
Proverbs	004	013	Take firm hold of instruction.  Don't let her go.
Proverbs	004	014	Don't enter into the path of the wicked.  Don't walk in the way
Proverbs	004	015	Avoid it, and don't pass by it.  Turn from it, and pass on.
Proverbs	004	016	For they don't sleep, unless they do evil.  Their sleep is
Proverbs	004	017	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs	004	018	But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,
Proverbs	004	019	The way of the wicked is like darkness.  They don't know
Proverbs	004	020	My son, attend to my words.  Turn your ear to my sayings.
Proverbs	004	021	Let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep them in the midst

Proverbs	004	023	Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the
Proverbs	004	024	Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.  Put corrupt lips
Proverbs	004	025	Let your eyes look straight ahead.  Fix your gaze
Proverbs	004	026	Make the path of your feet level.  Let all of your
Proverbs	004	027	Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left.  Remove your
Proverbs	005	001	My son, pay attention to my wisdom.  Turn your ear
Proverbs	005	002	that you may maintain discretion, that your lips
Proverbs	005	003	For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.  Her mouth is
Proverbs	005	004	But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp
Proverbs	005	005	Her feet go down to death.  Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
Proverbs	005	006	She gives no thought to the way of life.  Her ways are crooked,
Proverbs	005	007	Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.  Don't depart from
Proverbs	005	008	Remove your way far from her.  Don't come near the door
Proverbs	005	009	lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;
Proverbs	005	010	lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich
Proverbs	005	011	You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your
Proverbs	005	012	and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
Proverbs	005	013	neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned
Proverbs	005	014	I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of
Proverbs	005	015	Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of
Proverbs	005	016	Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water
Proverbs	005	017	Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.
Proverbs	005	018	Let your spring be blessed.  Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
Proverbs	005	019	A loving doe and a graceful deer--let her breasts satisfy you
Proverbs	005	020	For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
Proverbs	005	021	For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.
Proverbs	005	022	The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.  The cords of his sin
Proverbs	005	023	He will die for lack of instruction.  In the greatness of his folly,
Proverbs	006	001	My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,
Proverbs	006	002	You are trapped by the words of your mouth.  You are ensnared
Proverbs	006	003	Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have
Proverbs	006	004	Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
Proverbs	006	005	Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
Proverbs	006	006	Go to the ant, you sluggard.  Consider her ways, and be wise;
Proverbs	006	007	which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
Proverbs	006	008	provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food
Proverbs	006	009	How long will you sleep, sluggard?  When will you arise out
Proverbs	006	010	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
Proverbs	006	011	so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity
Proverbs	006	012	A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with
Proverbs	006	013	who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions
Proverbs	006	014	in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually,
Proverbs	006	015	Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.  He will be
Proverbs	006	016	There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are
Proverbs	006	017	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;
Proverbs	006	018	a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift
Proverbs	006	019	a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows
Proverbs	006	020	My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake
Proverbs	006	021	Bind them continually on your heart.  Tie them around your neck.
Proverbs	006	022	When you walk, it will lead you.  When you sleep, it will watch
Proverbs	006	023	For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.
Proverbs	006	024	to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of
Proverbs	006	025	Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her
Proverbs	006	026	For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
Proverbs	006	027	Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?
Proverbs	006	028	Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
Proverbs	006	029	So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.  Whoever touches
Proverbs	006	030	Men don't despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself
Proverbs	006	031	but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
Proverbs	006	032	He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
Proverbs	006	033	He will get wounds and dishonor.  His reproach will not
Proverbs	006	034	For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.  He won't spare
Proverbs	006	035	He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content,
Proverbs	007	001	My son, keep my words.  Lay up my commandments within you.
Proverbs	007	002	Keep my commandments and live!  Guard my teaching as the apple
Proverbs	007	003	Bind them on your fingers.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
Proverbs	007	004	Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."  Call understanding your relative,
Proverbs	007	005	that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner
Proverbs	007	006	For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.
Proverbs	007	007	I saw among the simple ones.  I discerned among the youths
Proverbs	007	008	passing through the street near her corner, he went the way
Proverbs	007	009	in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle
Proverbs	007	010	Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
Proverbs	007	011	She is loud and defiant.  Her feet don't stay in her house.
Proverbs	007	012	Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking
Proverbs	007	013	So she caught him, and kissed him.  With an impudent face she

Proverbs	007	015	Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face,
Proverbs	007	016	I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped
Proverbs	007	017	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs	007	018	Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning.
Proverbs	007	019	For my husband isn't at home.  He has gone on a long journey.
Proverbs	007	020	He has taken a bag of money with him.  He will come home
Proverbs	007	021	With persuasive words, she led him astray.  With the flattering
Proverbs	007	022	He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
Proverbs	007	023	Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries
Proverbs	007	024	Now therefore, sons, listen to me.  Pay attention to the words
Proverbs	007	025	Don't let your heart turn to her ways.  Don't go astray
Proverbs	007	026	for she has thrown down many wounded.  Yes, all her slain
Proverbs	007	027	Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
Proverbs	008	001	Doesn't wisdom cry out?  Doesn't understanding raise her voice?
Proverbs	008	002	On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet,
Proverbs	008	003	Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors,

Proverbs	008	015	By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
Proverbs	008	016	By me princes rule; nobles, and all the righteous rulers
Proverbs	008	017	I love those who love me.  Those who seek me diligently
Proverbs	008	018	With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.

Proverbs	008	034	Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates,

Ecclesiastes	001	002	"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities,
Ecclesiastes	001	003	What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors
Ecclesiastes	001	004	One generation goes, and another generation comes;
Ecclesiastes	001	005	The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its
Ecclesiastes	001	006	The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north.
Ecclesiastes	001	007	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full.
Ecclesiastes	001	008	All things are full of weariness beyond uttering.  The eye is
Ecclesiastes	001	009	That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has
Ecclesiastes	001	010	Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?"
Ecclesiastes	001	011	There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any
Ecclesiastes	001	012	I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes	001	013	I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning
Ecclesiastes	001	014	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun;
Ecclesiastes	001	015	That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is
Ecclesiastes	001	016	I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself
Ecclesiastes	001	017	I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly.
Ecclesiastes	001	018	For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases
Ecclesiastes	002	001	I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth:
Ecclesiastes	002	002	I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth,
Ecclesiastes	002	003	I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart
Ecclesiastes	002	004	I made myself great works.  I built myself houses.
Ecclesiastes	002	005	I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them
Ecclesiastes	002	006	I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest
Ecclesiastes	002	007	I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born
Ecclesiastes	002	008	I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings
Ecclesiastes	002	009	So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me
Ecclesiastes	002	010	Whatever my eyes desired, I didn't keep from them.
Ecclesiastes	002	011	Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked,
Ecclesiastes	002	012	I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly:
Ecclesiastes	002	013	Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
Ecclesiastes	002	014	The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness--
Ecclesiastes	002	015	Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool,
Ecclesiastes	002	016	For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory
Ecclesiastes	002	017	So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun
Ecclesiastes	002	018	I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun,
Ecclesiastes	002	019	Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool?
Ecclesiastes	002	020	Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning
Ecclesiastes	002	021	For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge,
Ecclesiastes	002	022	For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving
Ecclesiastes	002	023	For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief;
Ecclesiastes	002	024	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat
Ecclesiastes	002	025	For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
Ecclesiastes	002	026	For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge,
Ecclesiastes	003	001	For everything there is a season, and a time for every
Ecclesiastes	003	002	a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant,
Ecclesiastes	003	003	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down,
Ecclesiastes	003	004	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,
Ecclesiastes	003	005	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
Ecclesiastes	003	006	a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
Ecclesiastes	003	007	a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
Ecclesiastes	003	008	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war,
Ecclesiastes	003	009	What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
Ecclesiastes	003	010	I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men
Ecclesiastes	003	011	He has made everything beautiful in its time.  He has also set
Ecclesiastes	003	012	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice,
Ecclesiastes	003	013	Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all
Ecclesiastes	003	014	I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever.
Ecclesiastes	003	015	That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has
Ecclesiastes	003	016	Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice,
Ecclesiastes	003	017	I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked;
Ecclesiastes	003	018	I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them,
Ecclesiastes	003	019	For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals.
Ecclesiastes	003	020	All go to one place.  All are from the dust, and all turn
Ecclesiastes	003	021	Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward,
Ecclesiastes	003	022	Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man
Ecclesiastes	004	001	Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under
Ecclesiastes	004	002	Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than
Ecclesiastes	004	003	Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been,
Ecclesiastes	004	004	Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a
Ecclesiastes	004	005	The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.
Ecclesiastes	004	006	Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor
Ecclesiastes	004	007	Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes	004	008	There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother.
Ecclesiastes	004	009	Two are better than one, because they have a good reward
Ecclesiastes	004	010	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe
Ecclesiastes	004	011	Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can
Ecclesiastes	004	012	If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him;
Ecclesiastes	004	013	Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king
Ecclesiastes	004	014	For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his
Ecclesiastes	004	015	I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were
Ecclesiastes	004	016	There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom
Ecclesiastes	005	001	Guard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near
Ecclesiastes	005	002	Don't be rash with your mouth, and don't let your heart be
Ecclesiastes	005	003	For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's
Ecclesiastes	005	004	When you vow a vow to God, don't defer to pay it; for he has
Ecclesiastes	005	005	It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow
Ecclesiastes	005	006	Don't allow your mouth to lead you into sin.
Ecclesiastes	005	007	For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well
Ecclesiastes	005	008	If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking
Ecclesiastes	005	009	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all.  The king profits
Ecclesiastes	005	010	He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
Ecclesiastes	005	011	When goods increase, those who eat them are increased;
Ecclesiastes	005	012	The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much;
Ecclesiastes	005	013	There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:
Ecclesiastes	005	014	Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son,
Ecclesiastes	005	015	As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go
Ecclesiastes	005	016	This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came,
Ecclesiastes	005	017	All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated,
Ecclesiastes	005	018	Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for
Ecclesiastes	005	019	Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth,
Ecclesiastes	005	020	For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life;
Ecclesiastes	006	001	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it
Ecclesiastes	006	002	a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor,
Ecclesiastes	006	003	If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years,
Ecclesiastes	006	004	for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name
Ecclesiastes	006	005	Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it.  This has rest
Ecclesiastes	006	006	Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails
Ecclesiastes	006	007	All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
Ecclesiastes	006	008	For what advantage has the wise more than the fool?
Ecclesiastes	006	009	Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.
Ecclesiastes	006	010	Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is
Ecclesiastes	006	011	For there are many words that create vanity.  What does
Ecclesiastes	006	012	For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days
Ecclesiastes	007	001	A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death
Ecclesiastes	007	002	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go
Ecclesiastes	007	003	Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face
Ecclesiastes	007	004	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
Ecclesiastes	007	005	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man
Ecclesiastes	007	006	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
Ecclesiastes	007	007	Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe
Ecclesiastes	007	008	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.
Ecclesiastes	007	009	Don't be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests
Ecclesiastes	007	010	Don't say, "Why were the former days better than these?"
Ecclesiastes	007	011	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance.  Yes, it is more excellent
Ecclesiastes	007	012	For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense;
Ecclesiastes	007	013	Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight,
Ecclesiastes	007	014	In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of
Ecclesiastes	007	015	All this have I seen in my days of vanity:  there is a righteous
Ecclesiastes	007	016	Don't be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise.
Ecclesiastes	007	017	Don't be too wicked, neither be foolish.  Why should you die
Ecclesiastes	007	018	It is good that you should take hold of this.  Yes, also from
Ecclesiastes	007	019	Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers
Ecclesiastes	007	020	Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good
Ecclesiastes	007	021	Also don't take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you
Ecclesiastes	007	022	for often your own heart knows that you yourself have
Ecclesiastes	007	023	All this have I proved in wisdom.  I said, "I will be wise;"
Ecclesiastes	007	024	That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep.
Ecclesiastes	007	025	I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out,
Ecclesiastes	007	026	I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares
Ecclesiastes	007	027	Behold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another,
Ecclesiastes	007	028	which my soul still seeks; but I have not found:
Ecclesiastes	007	029	Behold, this only have I found:  that God made man upright;
Ecclesiastes	008	001	Who is like the wise man?  And who knows the interpretation of
Ecclesiastes	008	002	I say, "Keep the king's command!" because of the oath to God.
Ecclesiastes	008	003	Don't be hasty to go out of his presence.  Don't persist
Ecclesiastes	008	004	for the king's word is supreme.  Who can say to him,
Ecclesiastes	008	005	Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm,
Ecclesiastes	008	006	For there is a time and procedure for every purpose,
Ecclesiastes	008	007	For he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him
Ecclesiastes	008	008	There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain
Ecclesiastes	008	009	All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is
Ecclesiastes	008	010	So I saw the wicked buried.  Indeed they came also from holiness.
Ecclesiastes	008	011	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
Ecclesiastes	008	012	Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long,
Ecclesiastes	008	013	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
Ecclesiastes	008	014	There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there
Ecclesiastes	008	015	Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing
Ecclesiastes	008	016	When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
Ecclesiastes	008	017	then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out
Ecclesiastes	009	001	For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this:
Ecclesiastes	009	002	All things come alike to all.  There is one event to the righteous
Ecclesiastes	009	003	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there
Ecclesiastes	009	004	For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope;
Ecclesiastes	009	005	For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't
Ecclesiastes	009	006	Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago;
Ecclesiastes	009	007	Go your way--eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine
Ecclesiastes	009	008	Let your garments be always white, and don't let your
Ecclesiastes	009	009	Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of
Ecclesiastes	009	010	Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might;
Ecclesiastes	009	011	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
Ecclesiastes	009	012	For man also doesn't know his time.  As the fish that are taken
Ecclesiastes	009	013	I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it
Ecclesiastes	009	014	There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king
Ecclesiastes	009	015	Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom
Ecclesiastes	009	016	Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength.  Nevertheless the poor
Ecclesiastes	009	017	The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry
Ecclesiastes	009	018	Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner
Ecclesiastes	010	001	Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor;
Ecclesiastes	010	002	A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart
Ecclesiastes	010	003	Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding
Ecclesiastes	010	004	If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don't leave
Ecclesiastes	010	005	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort
Ecclesiastes	010	006	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
Ecclesiastes	010	007	I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants
Ecclesiastes	010	008	He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through
Ecclesiastes	010	009	Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them.
Ecclesiastes	010	010	If the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge,
Ecclesiastes	010	011	If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit
Ecclesiastes	010	012	The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool
Ecclesiastes	010	013	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness;
Ecclesiastes	010	014	A fool also multiplies words.  Man doesn't know what will be;
Ecclesiastes	010	015	The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't
Ecclesiastes	010	016	Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes
Ecclesiastes	010	017	Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
Ecclesiastes	010	018	By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness
Ecclesiastes	010	019	A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad;
Ecclesiastes	010	020	Don't curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don't curse
Ecclesiastes	011	001	Cast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it
Ecclesiastes	011	002	Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don't
Ecclesiastes	011	003	If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
Ecclesiastes	011	004	He who observes the wind won't sow; and he who regards
Ecclesiastes	011	005	As you don't know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones
Ecclesiastes	011	006	In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don't withhold
Ecclesiastes	011	007	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
Ecclesiastes	011	008	Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;
Ecclesiastes	011	009	Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you
Ecclesiastes	011	010	Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil
Ecclesiastes	012	001	Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,
Ecclesiastes	012	002	Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
Ecclesiastes	012	003	in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
Ecclesiastes	012	004	and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound
Ecclesiastes	012	005	yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
Ecclesiastes	012	006	before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
Ecclesiastes	012	007	and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
Ecclesiastes	012	008	Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
Ecclesiastes	012	009	Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
Ecclesiastes	012	010	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that
Ecclesiastes	012	011	The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails
Ecclesiastes	012	012	Furthermore, my son, be admonished:  of making many books there
Ecclesiastes	012	013	This is the end of the matter.  All has been heard.
Ecclesiastes	012	014	For God will bring every work into judgment, with every
Song of Solomon	001	001	The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. Beloved
Song of Solomon	001	002	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love
Song of Solomon	001	003	Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.  Your name is oil poured forth,
Song of Solomon	001	004	Take me away with you.  Let us hurry.  The king has brought me
Song of Solomon	001	005	I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem,
Song of Solomon	001	006	Don't stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me.
Song of Solomon	001	007	Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock,
Song of Solomon	001	008	If you don't know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks
Song of Solomon	001	009	I have compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
Song of Solomon	001	010	Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with
Song of Solomon	001	011	We will make you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.
Song of Solomon	001	012	While the king sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
Song of Solomon	001	013	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.
Song of Solomon	001	014	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards
Song of Solomon	001	015	Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
Song of Solomon	001	016	Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our
Song of Solomon	001	017	The beams of our house are cedars.  Our rafters are firs.
Song of Solomon	002	001	I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.  Lover
Song of Solomon	002	002	As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
Song of Solomon	002	003	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
Song of Solomon	002	004	He brought me to the banquet hall.  His banner over me is love.
Song of Solomon	002	005	Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am
Song of Solomon	002	006	His left hand is under my head.  His right hand embraces me.
Song of Solomon	002	007	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
Song of Solomon	002	008	The voice of my beloved!  Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains,
Song of Solomon	002	009	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.  Behold, he stands
Song of Solomon	002	010	My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise up, my love,
Song of Solomon	002	011	For, behold, the winter is past.  The rain is over and gone.
Song of Solomon	002	012	The flowers appear on the earth.  The time of the singing has come,
Song of Solomon	002	013	The fig tree ripens her green figs.  The vines are in blossom.
Song of Solomon	002	014	My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of
Song of Solomon	002	015	Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards;
Song of Solomon	002	016	My beloved is mine, and I am his.  He browses among the lilies.
Song of Solomon	002	017	Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
Song of Solomon	003	001	By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves.
Song of Solomon	003	002	I will get up now, and go about the city; in the streets
Song of Solomon	003	003	The watchmen who go about the city found me; "Have you seen
Song of Solomon	003	004	I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves.
Song of Solomon	003	005	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
Song of Solomon	003	006	Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars
Song of Solomon	003	007	Behold, it is Solomon's carriage!  Sixty mighty men are around it,
Song of Solomon	003	008	They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.
Song of Solomon	003	009	King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon	003	010	He made its pillars of silver, its bottom of gold,
Song of Solomon	003	011	Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,
Song of Solomon	004	001	Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
Song of Solomon	004	002	Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, which have come
Song of Solomon	004	003	Your lips are like scarlet thread.  Your mouth is lovely.
Song of Solomon	004	004	Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory, whereon a
Song of Solomon	004	005	Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe,
Song of Solomon	004	006	Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will go
Song of Solomon	004	007	You are all beautiful, my love.  There is no spot in you.
Song of Solomon	004	008	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon.
Song of Solomon	004	009	You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
Song of Solomon	004	010	How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
Song of Solomon	004	011	Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.  Honey and milk
Song of Solomon	004	012	A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; a locked up spring,
Song of Solomon	004	013	Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits:
Song of Solomon	004	014	spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind
Song of Solomon	004	015	a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, flowing streams
Song of Solomon	004	016	Awake, north wind; and come, you south!  Blow on my garden,
Song of Solomon	005	001	I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
Song of Solomon	005	002	I was asleep, but my heart was awake.  It is the voice
Song of Solomon	005	003	I have taken off my robe.  Indeed, must I put it on?
Song of Solomon	005	004	My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
Song of Solomon	005	005	I rose up to open for my beloved.  My hands dripped with myrrh,
Song of Solomon	005	006	I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away.
Song of Solomon	005	007	The watchmen who go about the city found me.  They beat me.
Song of Solomon	005	008	I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved,
Song of Solomon	005	009	How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest
Song of Solomon	005	010	My beloved is white and ruddy.  The best among ten thousand.
Song of Solomon	005	011	His head is like the purest gold.  His hair is bushy,
Song of Solomon	005	012	His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk,

Isaiah	001	001	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
Isaiah	001	002	Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
Isaiah	001	003	The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib;
Isaiah	001	004	Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed
Isaiah	001	005	Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more?
Isaiah	001	006	From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness
Isaiah	001	007	Your country is desolate.  Your cities are burned with fire.
Isaiah	001	008	The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
Isaiah	001	009	Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
Isaiah	001	010	Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!  Listen to the law
Isaiah	001	011	"What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh.
Isaiah	001	012	When you come to appear before me, who has required this
Isaiah	001	013	Bring no more vain offerings.  Incense is an abomination to me;
Isaiah	001	014	My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
Isaiah	001	015	When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
Isaiah	001	016	Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.  Put away the evil
Isaiah	001	017	Learn to do well.  Seek justice.  Relieve the oppressed.
Isaiah	001	018	"Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh:  "Though your
Isaiah	001	019	If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good
Isaiah	001	020	but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
Isaiah	001	021	How the faithful city has become a prostitute!  She was full
Isaiah	001	022	Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
Isaiah	001	023	Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.
Isaiah	001	024	Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, the Mighty One
Isaiah	001	025	and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross,
Isaiah	001	026	I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors
Isaiah	001	027	Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts
Isaiah	001	028	But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
Isaiah	001	029	For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
Isaiah	001	030	For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden
Isaiah	001	031	The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark.
Isaiah	002	001	This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning
Isaiah	002	002	It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's

Isaiah	002	008	Their land also is full of idols.  They worship the work
Isaiah	002	009	Man is brought low, and mankind is humbled; therefore don't
Isaiah	002	010	Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror
Isaiah	002	011	The lofty looks of man will be brought low, the haughtiness
Isaiah	002	012	For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that
Isaiah	002	013	For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
Isaiah	002	014	For all the high mountains, for all the hills that are lifted up,
Isaiah	002	015	For every lofty tower, for every fortified wall,
Isaiah	002	016	For all the ships of Tarshish, and for all pleasant imagery.
Isaiah	002	017	The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
Isaiah	002	018	The idols shall utterly pass away.
Isaiah	002	019	Men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes
Isaiah	002	020	In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,
Isaiah	002	021	To go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts
Isaiah	002	022	Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
Isaiah	003	001	For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem
Isaiah	003	002	the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet,
Isaiah	003	003	the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor,
Isaiah	003	004	I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall
Isaiah	003	005	The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone
Isaiah	003	006	Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house
Isaiah	003	007	In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;
Isaiah	003	008	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their
Isaiah	003	009	The look of their faces testify against them.  They parade
Isaiah	003	010	Tell the righteous "Good!"  For they shall eat the fruit
Isaiah	003	011	Woe to the wicked!  Disaster is upon them; for the deeds
Isaiah	003	012	As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
Isaiah	003	013	Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.
Isaiah	003	014	Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,
Isaiah	003	015	What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face
Isaiah	003	016	Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
Isaiah	003	017	therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head
Isaiah	003	018	In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets,
Isaiah	003	019	the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
Isaiah	003	020	the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume
Isaiah	003	021	the signet rings, the nose rings,
Isaiah	003	022	the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
Isaiah	003	023	the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras,

Isaiah	003	026	Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate
Isaiah	004	001	Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,
Isaiah	004	002	In that day, Yahweh's branch will be beautiful and glorious,
Isaiah	004	003	It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains
Isaiah	004	004	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
Isaiah	004	005	Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion,
Isaiah	004	006	There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat,
Isaiah	005	001	Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about
Isaiah	005	002	He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with
Isaiah	005	003	"Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge
Isaiah	005	004	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
Isaiah	005	005	Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
Isaiah	005	006	I will lay it a wasteland.  It won't be pruned nor hoed,
Isaiah	005	007	For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
Isaiah	005	008	Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field,
Isaiah	005	009	In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says:  "Surely many houses will
Isaiah	005	010	For ten acres{literally, ten yokes, or the amount of land

Isaiah	005	012	The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at
Isaiah	005	013	Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
Isaiah	005	014	Therefore Sheol{Sheol is the place of the dead.} has enlarged
Isaiah	005	015	So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes
Isaiah	005	016	but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One
Isaiah	005	017	Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers
Isaiah	005	018	Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
Isaiah	005	019	Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,
Isaiah	005	020	Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness
Isaiah	005	021	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent
Isaiah	005	022	Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions
Isaiah	005	023	who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice
Isaiah	005	024	Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
Isaiah	005	025	Therefore Yahweh's anger burns against his people, and he has
Isaiah	005	026	He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,
Isaiah	005	027	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
Isaiah	005	028	whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.  Their horses'
Isaiah	005	029	Their roaring will be like a lioness.  They will roar like
Isaiah	005	030	They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
Isaiah	006	001	In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on
Isaiah	006	002	Above him stood the seraphim.  Each one had six wings.
Isaiah	006	003	One called to another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh
Isaiah	006	004	The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him
Isaiah	006	005	Then I said, "Woe is me!  For I am undone, because I am a man of
Isaiah	006	006	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand,
Isaiah	006	007	He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has
Isaiah	006	008	I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send,
Isaiah	006	009	He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed,

Isaiah	006	013	If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed:
Isaiah	007	001	It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
Isaiah	007	002	It was told the house of David, saying, "Syria is allied
Isaiah	007	003	Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz,
Isaiah	007	004	Tell him, 'Be careful, and keep calm.  Don't be afraid,
Isaiah	007	005	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted
Isaiah	007	006	"Let's go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let's divide
Isaiah	007	007	This is what the Lord Yahweh says:  "It shall not stand,
Isaiah	007	008	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
Isaiah	007	009	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria
Isaiah	007	010	Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
Isaiah	007	011	"Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth,
Isaiah	007	012	But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh."
Isaiah	007	013	He said, "Listen now, house of David:  Is it not enough for you
Isaiah	007	014	Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
Isaiah	007	015	He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil,
Isaiah	007	016	For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
Isaiah	007	017	Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house,
Isaiah	007	018	It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly
Isaiah	007	019	They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys,
Isaiah	007	020	In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired
Isaiah	007	021	It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow,
Isaiah	007	022	and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk
Isaiah	007	023	It will happen in that day that every place where there
Isaiah	007	024	People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all
Isaiah	007	025	All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall
Isaiah	008	001	Yahweh said to me, "Take a large tablet, and write on it with a
Isaiah	008	002	and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify:
Isaiah	008	003	I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son.
Isaiah	008	004	For before the child knows how to say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,'
Isaiah	008	005	Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,
Isaiah	008	006	"Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah
Isaiah	008	007	now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood
Isaiah	008	008	It will sweep onward into Judah.  It will overflow and pass through;
Isaiah	008	009	Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces!  Listen, all you
Isaiah	008	010	Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing;
Isaiah	008	011	For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
Isaiah	008	012	"Don't say, 'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this
Isaiah	008	013	Yahweh of Armies is who you must regard as holy.
Isaiah	008	014	He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel,
Isaiah	008	015	Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared,
Isaiah	008	016	Wrap up the testimony.  Seal the law among my disciples.
Isaiah	008	017	I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob,
Isaiah	008	018	Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are
Isaiah	008	019	When they tell you, "Consult with those who have familiar
Isaiah	008	020	Turn to the law and to the testimony!  If they don't speak
Isaiah	008	021	They will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry;
Isaiah	008	022	and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom
Isaiah	009	001	But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish.
Isaiah	009	002	The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
Isaiah	009	003	You have multiplied the nation.  You have increased their joy.
Isaiah	009	004	For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder,
Isaiah	009	005	For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle,
Isaiah	009	006	For to us a child is born.  To us a son is given;
Isaiah	009	007	Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall
Isaiah	009	008	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it falls on Israel.
Isaiah	009	009	All the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants
Isaiah	009	010	"The bricks have fallen, but we will build with hewn stone.
Isaiah	009	011	Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries
Isaiah	009	012	The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they
Isaiah	009	013	Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,
Isaiah	009	014	Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,
Isaiah	009	015	The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet
Isaiah	009	016	For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those
Isaiah	009	017	Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
Isaiah	009	018	For wickedness burns like a fire.  It devours the briers
Isaiah	009	019	Through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, the land is
Isaiah	009	020	One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will
Isaiah	009	021	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall
Isaiah	010	001	Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers
Isaiah	010	002	to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among
Isaiah	010	003	What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
Isaiah	010	004	They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall
Isaiah	010	005	Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand
Isaiah	010	006	I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people
Isaiah	010	007	However he doesn't mean so, neither does his heart think so;
Isaiah	010	008	For he says, "Aren't all of my princes kings?
Isaiah	010	009	Isn't Calno like Carchemish?  Isn't Hamath like Arpad?
Isaiah	010	010	As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved
Isaiah	010	011	shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols,
Isaiah	010	012	Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed
Isaiah	010	013	For he has said, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
Isaiah	010	014	My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest,
Isaiah	010	015	Should an axe brag against him who chops with it?
Isaiah	010	016	Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat
Isaiah	010	017	The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One
Isaiah	010	018	He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field,
Isaiah	010	019	The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
Isaiah	010	020	It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel,
Isaiah	010	021	A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob,
Isaiah	010	022	For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea,
Isaiah	010	023	For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end,
Isaiah	010	024	Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says "My people who dwell
Isaiah	010	025	For yet a very little while, and the indignation against
Isaiah	010	026	Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him,
Isaiah	010	027	It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart
Isaiah	010	028	He has come to Aiath.  He has passed through Migron.
Isaiah	010	029	They have gone over the pass.  They have taken up their lodging
Isaiah	010	030	Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim!  Listen, Laishah!
Isaiah	010	031	Madmenah is a fugitive.  The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
Isaiah	010	032	This very day he will halt at Nob.  He shakes his hand at
Isaiah	010	033	Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror.
Isaiah	010	034	He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
Isaiah	011	001	A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch
Isaiah	011	002	The Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him:  the spirit of wisdom
Isaiah	011	003	His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh.  He will not judge
Isaiah	011	004	but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide
Isaiah	011	005	Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness
Isaiah	011	006	The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down
Isaiah	011	007	The cow and the bear will graze.  Their young ones will lie
Isaiah	011	008	The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole, and the weaned
Isaiah	011	009	They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
Isaiah	011	010	It will happen in that day that the nations will seek
Isaiah	011	011	It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand
Isaiah	011	012	He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble
Isaiah	011	013	The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute
Isaiah	011	014	They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west.
Isaiah	011	015	Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
Isaiah	011	016	There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his
Isaiah	012	001	In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, Yahweh;
Isaiah	012	002	Behold, God is my salvation.  I will trust, and will not
Isaiah	012	003	Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.
Isaiah	012	004	In that day you will say, "Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name.
Isaiah	012	005	Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things!
Isaiah	012	006	Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One
Isaiah	013	001	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:
Isaiah	013	002	Set up a banner on the bare mountain!  Lift up your voice to them!
Isaiah	013	003	I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called
Isaiah	013	004	The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people;
Isaiah	013	005	They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven,
Isaiah	013	006	Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at hand!  It will come as
Isaiah	013	007	Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt.
Isaiah	013	008	They will be dismayed.  Pangs and sorrows will seize them.
Isaiah	013	009	Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger;
Isaiah	013	010	For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give
Isaiah	013	011	I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
Isaiah	013	012	I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person
Isaiah	013	013	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will
Isaiah	013	014	It will happen that like a a hunted gazelle, and like sheep
Isaiah	013	015	Everyone who is found will be thrust through.  Everyone who is
Isaiah	013	016	Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes.
Isaiah	013	017	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not
Isaiah	013	018	Their bows will dash the young men in pieces;
Isaiah	013	019	Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans'
Isaiah	013	020	It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from
Isaiah	013	021	But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their
Isaiah	013	022	Wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the
Isaiah	014	001	For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will
Isaiah	014	002	The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place.
Isaiah	014	003	It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from
Isaiah	014	004	that you will take up this parable against the king
Isaiah	014	005	Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter
Isaiah	014	006	who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled
Isaiah	014	007	The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet.  They break out song.
Isaiah	014	008	Yes, the fir trees rejoice with you, with the cedars
Isaiah	014	009	Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming.
Isaiah	014	010	They all will answer and ask you, "Have you also become as weak
Isaiah	014	011	Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your
Isaiah	014	012	How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn!
Isaiah	014	013	You said in your heart, "I will ascend into heaven!
Isaiah	014	014	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds!  I will make
Isaiah	014	015	Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit.
Isaiah	014	016	Those who see you will stare at you.  They will ponder you,
Isaiah	014	017	who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities;
Isaiah	014	018	All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in
Isaiah	014	019	But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch,
Isaiah	014	020	You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed
Isaiah	014	021	Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity
Isaiah	014	022	"I will rise up against them," says Yahweh of Armies,
Isaiah	014	023	"I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools
Isaiah	014	024	Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought,
Isaiah	014	025	that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him
Isaiah	014	026	This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth.
Isaiah	014	027	For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it?
Isaiah	014	028	This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
Isaiah	014	029	Don't rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that
Isaiah	014	030	The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie
Isaiah	014	031	Howl, gate!  Cry, city!  You are melted away, Philistia, all of you;
Isaiah	014	032	What will they answer the messengers of the nation?
Isaiah	015	001	The burden of Moab:  for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste,
Isaiah	015	002	They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places,
Isaiah	015	003	In their streets, they dress themselves in sackcloth.
Isaiah	015	004	Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.  Their voice is heard even
Isaiah	015	005	My heart cries out for Moab!  Her nobles flee to Zoar,
Isaiah	015	006	For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has
Isaiah	015	007	Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten,
Isaiah	015	008	For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; its wailing
Isaiah	015	009	For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring
Isaiah	016	001	Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness,
Isaiah	016	002	For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest,
Isaiah	016	003	Give counsel!  Execute justice!  Make your shade like
Isaiah	016	004	Let my outcasts dwell with you!  As for Moab, be a
Isaiah	016	005	A throne will be established in loving kindness.  One will sit
Isaiah	016	006	We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud;
Isaiah	016	007	Therefore Moab will wail for Moab.  Everyone will wail.
Isaiah	016	008	For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah.
Isaiah	016	009	Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine
Isaiah	016	010	Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field;
Isaiah	016	011	Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward
Isaiah	016	012	It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies
Isaiah	016	013	This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.
Isaiah	016	014	But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, "Within three years,
Isaiah	017	001	The burden of Damascus:  "Behold, Damascus is taken away
Isaiah	017	002	The cities of Aroer are forsaken.  They will be for flocks,
Isaiah	017	003	The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
Isaiah	017	004	"It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be
Isaiah	017	005	It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his
Isaiah	017	006	Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree,
Isaiah	017	007	In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes
Isaiah	017	008	They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands;
Isaiah	017	009	In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places
Isaiah	017	010	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not
Isaiah	017	011	In the day of your planting, you hedge it in.  In the morning,
Isaiah	017	012	Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas;
Isaiah	017	013	The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters:
Isaiah	017	014	At evening, behold, terror!  Before the morning, they are no more.
Isaiah	018	001	Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond
Isaiah	018	002	that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
Isaiah	018	003	All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth,
Isaiah	018	004	For Yahweh said to me, "I will be still, and I will see in my
Isaiah	018	005	For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
Isaiah	018	006	They will be left together for the ravenous birds
Isaiah	018	007	In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies
Isaiah	019	001	The burden of Egypt:  "Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud,
Isaiah	019	002	I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they
Isaiah	019	003	The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst.  I will destroy
Isaiah	019	004	I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord.
Isaiah	019	005	The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted
Isaiah	019	006	The rivers will become foul.  The streams of Egypt will be
Isaiah	019	007	The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all
Isaiah	019	008	The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile
Isaiah	019	009	Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave
Isaiah	019	010	The pillars will be broken in pieces.  All those who work
Isaiah	019	011	The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish.  The counsel
Isaiah	019	012	Where then are your wise men?  Let them tell you now; and let
Isaiah	019	013	The princes of Zoan have become fools.  The princes of Memphis
Isaiah	019	014	Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her;
Isaiah	019	015	Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail,
Isaiah	019	016	In that day the Egyptians will be like women.  They will tremble
Isaiah	019	017	The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt.  Everyone to whom
Isaiah	019	018	In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that
Isaiah	019	019	In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst
Isaiah	019	020	It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies
Isaiah	019	021	Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh
Isaiah	019	022	Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing.
Isaiah	019	023	In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
Isaiah	019	024	In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
Isaiah	019	025	because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying,
Isaiah	020	001	In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king
Isaiah	020	002	at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
Isaiah	020	003	Yahweh said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and
Isaiah	020	004	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt
Isaiah	020	005	They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia
Isaiah	020	006	The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, 'Behold,
Isaiah	021	001	The burden of the wilderness of the sea.  As whirlwinds
Isaiah	021	002	A grievous vision is declared to me.  The treacherous
Isaiah	021	003	Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish.  Pains have
Isaiah	021	004	My heart flutters.  Horror has frightened me.  The twilight
Isaiah	021	005	They prepare the table.  They set the watch.  They eat.
Isaiah	021	006	For the Lord said to me, "Go, set a watchman.  Let him declare
Isaiah	021	007	When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop
Isaiah	021	008	He cried like a lion:  "Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower
Isaiah	021	009	Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs."
Isaiah	021	010	You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!"
Isaiah	021	011	The burden of Dumah.  One calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman,
Isaiah	021	012	The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night.
Isaiah	021	013	The burden on Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia you will lodge,
Isaiah	021	014	They brought water to him who was thirsty.  The inhabitants
Isaiah	021	015	For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword,
Isaiah	021	016	For the Lord said to me, "Within a year, as a worker bound
Isaiah	021	017	and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty
Isaiah	022	001	The burden of the valley of vision.  What ails you now,
Isaiah	022	002	You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town;
Isaiah	022	003	All your rulers fled away together.  They were bound by
Isaiah	022	004	Therefore I said, "Look away from me.  I will weep bitterly.
Isaiah	022	005	For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity,
Isaiah	022	006	Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen;
Isaiah	022	007	It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
Isaiah	022	008	He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day
Isaiah	022	009	You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many;
Isaiah	022	010	You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down
Isaiah	022	011	You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water
Isaiah	022	012	In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping,
Isaiah	022	013	and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep,
Isaiah	022	014	Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, "Surely this
Isaiah	022	015	Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, "Go, get yourself to
Isaiah	022	016	'What are you doing here?  Who has you here, that you have
Isaiah	022	017	Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently.
Isaiah	022	018	He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you
Isaiah	022	019	I will thrust you from your office.  You will be pulled down
Isaiah	022	020	It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim
Isaiah	022	021	and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him
Isaiah	022	022	I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder.
Isaiah	022	023	I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place.
Isaiah	022	024	They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house,
Isaiah	022	025	"In that day," says Yahweh of Armies, "the nail that was fastened
Isaiah	023	001	The burden of Tyre.  Howl, you ships of Tarshish!  For it
Isaiah	023	002	Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants
Isaiah	023	003	On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile,
Isaiah	023	004	Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold
Isaiah	023	005	When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at
Isaiah	023	006	Pass over to Tarshish!  Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
Isaiah	023	007	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days,
Isaiah	023	008	Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns,
Isaiah	023	009	Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory,
Isaiah	023	010	Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish.
Isaiah	023	011	He has stretched out his hand over the sea.  He has
Isaiah	023	012	He said, "You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed
Isaiah	023	013	Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.  This people was not.
Isaiah	023	014	Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!
Isaiah	023	015	It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten
Isaiah	023	016	Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has
Isaiah	023	017	It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh
Isaiah	023	018	Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh.
Isaiah	024	001	Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste,
Isaiah	024	002	It will be as with the people, so with the priest;
Isaiah	024	003	The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste;
Isaiah	024	004	The earth mourns and fades away.  The world languishes and
Isaiah	024	005	The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they
Isaiah	024	006	Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who
Isaiah	024	007	The new wine mourns.  The vine languishes.
Isaiah	024	008	The mirth of tambourines ceases.  The sound of those who
Isaiah	024	009	They will not drink wine with a song.  Strong drink will be
Isaiah	024	010	The confused city is broken down.  Every house is shut up,
Isaiah	024	011	There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.
Isaiah	024	012	The city is left in desolation, and the gate is
Isaiah	024	013	For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
Isaiah	024	014	These shall lift up their voice.  They will shout for the majesty
Isaiah	024	015	Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh,
Isaiah	024	016	From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.
Isaiah	024	017	Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.
Isaiah	024	018	It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear
Isaiah	024	019	The earth is utterly broken.  The earth is torn apart.
Isaiah	024	020	The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back
Isaiah	024	021	It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army
Isaiah	024	022	They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
Isaiah	024	023	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed;
Isaiah	025	001	Yahweh, you are my God.  I will exalt you!  I will praise your name,
Isaiah	025	002	For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city
Isaiah	025	003	Therefore a strong people will glorify you.  A city of awesome
Isaiah	025	004	For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold
Isaiah	025	005	As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise
Isaiah	025	006	In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast
Isaiah	025	007	He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering
Isaiah	025	008	He has swallowed up death forever!  The Lord Yahweh will wipe
Isaiah	025	009	It shall be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God!  We have
Isaiah	025	010	For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest.
Isaiah	025	011	He will spread out his hands in its midst, like one who swims
Isaiah	025	012	He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low,
Isaiah	026	001	In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:  "We have
Isaiah	026	002	Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
Isaiah	026	003	You will keep whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
Isaiah	026	004	Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
Isaiah	026	005	For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
Isaiah	026	006	The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor,
Isaiah	026	007	The way of the just is uprightness.  You who are upright make
Isaiah	026	008	Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
Isaiah	026	009	With my soul have I desired you in the night.
Isaiah	026	010	Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not
Isaiah	026	011	Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don't see; but they
Isaiah	026	012	Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked
Isaiah	026	013	Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
Isaiah	026	014	The dead shall not live.  The deceased shall not rise.
Isaiah	026	015	You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.  You have increased
Isaiah	026	016	Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.  They poured out
Isaiah	026	017	Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time
Isaiah	026	018	We have been with child.  We have been in pain.  We gave birth,
Isaiah	026	019	Your dead shall live.  My dead bodies shall arise.
Isaiah	026	020	Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your
Isaiah	026	021	For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish
Isaiah	027	001	In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword
Isaiah	027	002	In that day, sing to her, "A pleasant vineyard!
Isaiah	027	003	I, Yahweh, am its keeper.  I will water it every moment.
Isaiah	027	004	Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns,
Isaiah	027	005	Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make
Isaiah	027	006	In days to come, Jacob will take root.  Israel will blossom and bud.
Isaiah	027	007	Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them?
Isaiah	027	008	In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them.
Isaiah	027	009	Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven,
Isaiah	027	010	For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted
Isaiah	027	011	When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off.
Isaiah	027	012	It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from
Isaiah	027	013	It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown;
Isaiah	028	001	Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to
Isaiah	028	002	Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one.  Like a storm of hail,
Isaiah	028	003	The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be
Isaiah	028	004	The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
Isaiah	028	005	In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory,
Isaiah	028	006	and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
Isaiah	028	007	They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink.
Isaiah	028	008	For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
Isaiah	028	009	Whom will he teach knowledge?  To whom will he explain the message?
Isaiah	028	010	For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line,
Isaiah	028	011	But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and
Isaiah	028	012	to whom he said, "This is the resting place.  Give rest to weary;"
Isaiah	028	013	Therefore the word of Yahweh will be to them precept on precept,
Isaiah	028	014	Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule
Isaiah	028	015	"Because you have said, 'We have made a covenant with death,
Isaiah	028	016	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, "Behold, I lay in Zion
Isaiah	028	017	I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness
Isaiah	028	018	Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement
Isaiah	028	019	As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning
Isaiah	028	020	For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket
Isaiah	028	021	For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim.
Isaiah	028	022	Now therefore don't be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong;
Isaiah	028	023	Give ear, and hear my voice!  Listen, and hear my speech!
Isaiah	028	024	Does he who plows to sow plow continually?  Does he keep
Isaiah	028	025	When he has leveled its surface, doesn't he plant the dill,
Isaiah	028	026	For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
Isaiah	028	027	For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument,
Isaiah	028	028	Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it.
Isaiah	028	029	This also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful
Isaiah	029	001	Woe to Ariel!  Ariel, the city where David encamped!
Isaiah	029	002	then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning
Isaiah	029	003	I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay
Isaiah	029	004	You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground.
Isaiah	029	005	But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust,
Isaiah	029	006	She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder,
Isaiah	029	007	The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
Isaiah	029	008	It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold,
Isaiah	029	009	Pause and wonder!  Blind yourselves and be blind!
Isaiah	029	010	For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
Isaiah	029	011	All vision has become to you like the words of a book that
Isaiah	029	012	and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying,
Isaiah	029	013	The Lord said, "Because this people draws near with their mouth
Isaiah	029	014	therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work
Isaiah	029	015	Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh,
Isaiah	029	016	You turn things upside down!  Should the potter be thought
Isaiah	029	017	Isn't it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned
Isaiah	029	018	In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book,
Isaiah	029	019	The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor
Isaiah	029	020	For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases,
Isaiah	029	021	who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare
Isaiah	029	022	Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
Isaiah	029	023	But when he sees his children, the work of my hands,
Isaiah	029	024	They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
Isaiah	030	001	"Woe to the rebellious children," says Yahweh, "who take counsel,
Isaiah	030	002	who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice;
Isaiah	030	003	Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
Isaiah	030	004	For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have
Isaiah	030	005	They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can't
Isaiah	030	006	The burden of the animals of the South.  Through the land
Isaiah	030	007	For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I
Isaiah	030	008	Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book,
Isaiah	030	009	For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who
Isaiah	030	010	who tell the seers, "Don't see!" and to the prophets,
Isaiah	030	011	Get out of the way.  Turn aside from the path.
Isaiah	030	012	Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you
Isaiah	030	013	therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready
Isaiah	030	014	He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it
Isaiah	030	015	For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, "You will
Isaiah	030	016	but you said, "No, for we will flee on horses;"
Isaiah	030	017	One thousand will flee at the threat of one.  At the threat
Isaiah	030	018	Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you;
Isaiah	030	019	For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem.  You will weep
Isaiah	030	020	Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water
Isaiah	030	021	and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left,
Isaiah	030	022	You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images

Isaiah	030	024	The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will

Isaiah	030	026	Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
Isaiah	030	027	Behold, the name of Yahweh comes from far away, burning with
Isaiah	030	028	His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to
Isaiah	030	029	You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept;
Isaiah	030	030	Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show
Isaiah	030	031	For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed.
Isaiah	030	032	Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay
Isaiah	030	033	For his burning place has long been ready.  Yes, for the king
Isaiah	031	001	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses,
Isaiah	031	002	Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back
Isaiah	031	003	Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
Isaiah	031	004	For thus says Yahweh to me, "As the lion and the young lion
Isaiah	031	005	As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.

Isaiah	032	004	The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue
Isaiah	032	005	The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel
Isaiah	032	006	For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity,
Isaiah	032	007	The ways of the scoundrel are evil.  He devises wicked
Isaiah	032	008	But the noble devises noble things; and he will continue
Isaiah	032	009	Rise up, you women who are at ease!  Hear my voice!
Isaiah	032	010	For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;

Isaiah	032	012	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
Isaiah	032	013	Thorns and briars will come up on my people's land; yes, on all

Isaiah	032	018	My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings,
Isaiah	032	019	Though hail flattens the forest, and the city is leveled completely.
Isaiah	032	020	Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet
Isaiah	033	001	Woe to you who destroy, but you weren't destroyed; and who betray,
Isaiah	033	002	Yahweh, be gracious to us.  We have waited for you.
Isaiah	033	003	At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.
Isaiah	033	004	Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
Isaiah	033	005	Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high.  He has filled Zion
Isaiah	033	006	There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation,
Isaiah	033	007	Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors
Isaiah	033	008	The highways are desolate.  The traveling man ceases.
Isaiah	033	009	The land mourns and languishes.  Lebanon is confounded and

Isaiah	033	021	But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad

Isaiah	033	023	Your rigging is untied.  They couldn't strengthen the foot

Isaiah	034	001	Come near, you nations, to hear!  Listen, you peoples.
Isaiah	034	002	For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry
Isaiah	034	003	Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead
Isaiah	034	004	All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.  The sky will be

Isaiah	034	008	For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense
Isaiah	034	009	Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur,
Isaiah	034	010	It won't be quenched night nor day.  Its smoke will go up forever.

Isaiah	036	001	Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
Isaiah	036	002	The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
Isaiah	036	003	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
Isaiah	036	004	Rabshakeh said to them, "Now tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says
Isaiah	036	005	I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words.
Isaiah	036	006	Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt,
Isaiah	036	007	But if you tell me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' isn't that
Isaiah	036	008	Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king
Isaiah	036	009	How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least
Isaiah	036	010	Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it?
Isaiah	036	011	Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak
Isaiah	036	012	But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master
Isaiah	036	013	Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in
Isaiah	036	014	Thus says the king, 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
Isaiah	036	015	Don't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will
Isaiah	036	016	Don't listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king
Isaiah	036	017	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
Isaiah	036	018	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, "Yahweh will deliver us."
Isaiah	036	019	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?  Where are the gods
Isaiah	036	020	Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have
Isaiah	036	021	But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply,
Isaiah	036	022	Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
Isaiah	037	001	It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes,
Isaiah	037	002	He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
Isaiah	037	003	They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble,
Isaiah	037	004	It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
Isaiah	037	005	So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah	037	006	Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Don't be
Isaiah	037	007	Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news,
Isaiah	037	008	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
Isaiah	037	009	He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, "He has
Isaiah	037	010	"Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Don't let
Isaiah	037	011	Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria
Isaiah	037	012	Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers
Isaiah	037	013	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
Isaiah	037	014	Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers
Isaiah	037	015	Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,
Isaiah	037	016	"Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among
Isaiah	037	017	Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear.  Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold.
Isaiah	037	018	Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all
Isaiah	037	019	and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods,
Isaiah	037	020	Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand,
Isaiah	037	021	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus
Isaiah	037	022	this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him.
Isaiah	037	023	Whom have you defied and blasphemed?  Against whom have
Isaiah	037	024	By your servants, have you defied the Lord, and have said,
Isaiah	037	025	I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I
Isaiah	037	026	Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it
Isaiah	037	027	Therefore their inhabitants had little power.  They were dismayed
Isaiah	037	028	But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in,
Isaiah	037	029	Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance
Isaiah	037	030	This shall be the sign to you.  You will eat this year that
Isaiah	037	031	The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again
Isaiah	037	032	For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, and survivors
Isaiah	037	033	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will
Isaiah	037	034	By the way that he came, by the same he shall return,
Isaiah	037	035	'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,
Isaiah	037	036	The angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and
Isaiah	037	037	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away,
Isaiah	037	038	It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
Isaiah	038	001	In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death.
Isaiah	038	002	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,
Isaiah	038	003	and said, "Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked
Isaiah	038	004	Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,
Isaiah	038	005	"Go, and tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David
Isaiah	038	006	I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king
Isaiah	038	007	This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will

Isaiah	038	009	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
Isaiah	038	010	I said, "In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
Isaiah	038	011	I said, "I won't see Yah, Yah in the land of the living.

Isaiah	038	014	I chattered like a swallow or a crane.  I moaned like a dove.
Isaiah	038	015	What will I say?  He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.
Isaiah	038	016	Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life
Isaiah	038	017	Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in love
Isaiah	038	018	For Sheol can't praise you.  Death can't celebrate you.
Isaiah	038	019	The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day.
Isaiah	038	020	Yahweh will save me.  Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed
Isaiah	038	021	Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and lay

Isaiah	039	001	At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan,
Isaiah	039	002	Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house
Isaiah	039	003	Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him,
Isaiah	039	004	Then he asked, "What have they seen in your house?"
Isaiah	039	005	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:
Isaiah	039	006	'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house,
Isaiah	039	007	'They will take away your sons who will issue from you,
Isaiah	039	008	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Yahweh's word which you have

Isaiah	040	025	"To whom then will you liken me?  Who is my equal?"
Isaiah	040	026	Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these,
Isaiah	040	027	Why do you say, Jacob, and speak, Israel, "My way is hidden

Isaiah	041	011	Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed
Isaiah	041	012	You will seek them, and won't find them, even those who contend
Isaiah	041	013	For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you,
Isaiah	041	014	Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel.
Isaiah	041	015	Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument
Isaiah	041	016	You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,
Isaiah	041	017	The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
Isaiah	041	018	I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst

Isaiah	042	003	He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a dimly burning wick.
Isaiah	042	004	He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice

Isaiah	044	016	He burns part of it in the fire.  With part of it, he eats meat.
Isaiah	044	017	The rest of it he makes into a god, even his engraved image.
Isaiah	044	018	They don't know, neither do they consider:  for he has
Isaiah	044	019	No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,
Isaiah	044	020	He feeds on ashes.  A deceived heart has turned him aside;
Isaiah	044	021	Remember these things, Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant.
Isaiah	044	022	I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and,
Isaiah	044	023	Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it!  Shout, you lower
Isaiah	044	024	Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb:
Isaiah	044	025	who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad;
Isaiah	044	026	who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel
Isaiah	044	027	who says to the deep, 'Be dry,' and 'I will dry up your rivers;'
Isaiah	044	028	Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
Isaiah	045	001	Thus says Yahweh to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand
Isaiah	045	002	"I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth.
Isaiah	045	003	I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches
Isaiah	045	004	For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my chosen, I have
Isaiah	045	005	I am Yahweh, and there is none else.  Besides me, there is no God.
Isaiah	045	006	that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west,
Isaiah	045	007	I form the light, and create darkness.  I make peace,
Isaiah	045	008	Distil, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour
Isaiah	045	009	Woe to him who strives with his Maker--a clay pot among the clay
Isaiah	045	010	Woe to him who says to a father, 'What have you become the father of?'
Isaiah	045	011	Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:  "You ask
Isaiah	045	012	I have made the earth, and created man on it:  I, even my hands,
Isaiah	045	013	I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight
Isaiah	045	014	Thus says Yahweh:  "The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise
Isaiah	045	015	Most certainly you are a God who hid yourself, God of Israel,
Isaiah	045	016	They shall be disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them;
Isaiah	045	017	[But] Israel shall be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation:
Isaiah	045	018	For thus says Yahweh who created the heavens, the God
Isaiah	045	019	I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness;
Isaiah	045	020	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who
Isaiah	045	021	Declare you, and bring [it] forth; yes, let them take
Isaiah	045	022	Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth;
Isaiah	045	023	By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth
Isaiah	045	024	Only in Yahweh, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength;
Isaiah	045	025	In Yahweh shall all the seed of Israel be justified,
Isaiah	046	001	Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals,
Isaiah	046	002	They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver
Isaiah	046	003	Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house
Isaiah	046	004	and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I
Isaiah	046	005	To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
Isaiah	046	006	Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance.
Isaiah	046	007	They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in
Isaiah	046	008	Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again
Isaiah	046	009	Remember the former things of old:  for I am God, and there
Isaiah	046	010	declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
Isaiah	046	011	calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from
Isaiah	046	012	Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:
Isaiah	046	013	I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off,
Isaiah	047	001	Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon;
Isaiah	047	002	Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil,
Isaiah	047	003	Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen:
Isaiah	047	004	Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah	047	005	Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans;
Isaiah	047	006	I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance,
Isaiah	047	007	You said, I shall be mistress forever; so that you did not lay
Isaiah	047	008	Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,
Isaiah	047	009	but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day,
Isaiah	047	010	For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, None sees me;
Isaiah	047	011	Therefore shall evil come on you; you shall not know the dawning
Isaiah	047	012	Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude
Isaiah	047	013	You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels:  let now
Isaiah	047	014	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
Isaiah	047	015	Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored:
Isaiah	048	001	Hear you this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name
Isaiah	048	002	(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
Isaiah	048	003	I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went
Isaiah	048	004	Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an
Isaiah	048	005	therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it
Isaiah	048	006	You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it?
Isaiah	048	007	They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day
Isaiah	048	008	Yes, you didn't hear; yes, you didn't know; yes, from of old
Isaiah	048	009	For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise
Isaiah	048	010	Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen
Isaiah	048	011	For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should [my
Isaiah	048	012	Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called:  I am he;
Isaiah	048	013	Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my
Isaiah	048	014	Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has
Isaiah	048	015	I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him,
Isaiah	048	016	Come you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have
Isaiah	048	017	Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:  I am
Isaiah	048	018	Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then had your
Isaiah	048	019	your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your
Isaiah	048	020	Go you forth from Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans;
Isaiah	048	021	They didn't thirst when he led them through the deserts;
Isaiah	048	022	There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.
Isaiah	049	001	Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far:
Isaiah	049	002	and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
Isaiah	049	003	and he said to me, You are my servant; Israel, in whom I
Isaiah	049	004	But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength
Isaiah	049	005	Now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
Isaiah	049	006	yes, he says, It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
Isaiah	049	007	Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One,
Isaiah	049	008	Thus says Yahweh, In an acceptable time have I answered you,
Isaiah	049	009	saying to those who are bound, Go forth; to those who are
Isaiah	049	010	They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
Isaiah	049	011	I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways
Isaiah	049	012	Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from
Isaiah	049	013	Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth
Isaiah	049	014	But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord
Isaiah	049	015	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
Isaiah	049	016	Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
Isaiah	049	017	Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made
Isaiah	049	018	Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  all these gather
Isaiah	049	019	For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land
Isaiah	049	020	The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears,
Isaiah	049	021	Then shall you say in your heart, Who has conceived these for me,
Isaiah	049	022	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will lift up my hand
Isaiah	049	023	Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens
Isaiah	049	024	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
Isaiah	049	025	But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty shall
Isaiah	049	026	I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they
Isaiah	050	001	Thus says Yahweh, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce,
Isaiah	050	002	Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there
Isaiah	050	003	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
Isaiah	050	004	The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught,
Isaiah	050	005	The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious,
Isaiah	050	006	I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked
Isaiah	050	007	For the Lord Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not
Isaiah	050	008	He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me?
Isaiah	050	009	Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me; who is he who shall
Isaiah	050	010	Who is among you who fears Yahweh, who obeys the voice
Isaiah	050	011	Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves
Isaiah	051	001	Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,
Isaiah	051	002	Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you;
Isaiah	051	003	For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her
Isaiah	051	004	Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation:
Isaiah	051	005	My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and my
Isaiah	051	006	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath;
Isaiah	051	007	Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose
Isaiah	051	008	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
Isaiah	051	009	Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in
Isaiah	051	010	Isn't it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep;
Isaiah	051	011	The ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing
Isaiah	051	012	I, even I, am he who comforts you:  who are you, that you are
Isaiah	051	013	and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, who stretched forth
Isaiah	051	014	The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die
Isaiah	051	015	For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves
Isaiah	051	016	I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in
Isaiah	051	017	Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand
Isaiah	051	018	There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has
Isaiah	051	019	These two things have happened to you.  Who will bemoan you?
Isaiah	051	020	Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets,
Isaiah	051	021	Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken,
Isaiah	051	022	Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause
Isaiah	051	023	and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,
Isaiah	052	001	Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful
Isaiah	052	002	Shake yourself from the dust; arise, sit [on your throne], Jerusalem:
Isaiah	052	003	For thus says Yahweh, You were sold for nothing; and you shall
Isaiah	052	004	For thus says the Lord Yahweh, My people went down at the first
Isaiah	052	005	Now therefore, what do I here, says Yahweh, seeing that my people
Isaiah	052	006	Therefore my people shall know my name:  therefore [they shall
Isaiah	052	007	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings
Isaiah	052	008	The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice,
Isaiah	052	009	Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;
Isaiah	052	010	Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
Isaiah	052	011	Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing;
Isaiah	052	012	For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight:
Isaiah	052	013	Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted
Isaiah	052	014	Like as many were astonished at you (his visage was so marred
Isaiah	052	015	so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths
Isaiah	053	001	Who has believed our message?  To whom has the arm of
Isaiah	053	002	For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root
Isaiah	053	003	He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering,
Isaiah	053	004	Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering;
Isaiah	053	005	But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed
Isaiah	053	006	All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to his
Isaiah	053	007	He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth.
Isaiah	053	008	He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for
Isaiah	053	009	They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man
Isaiah	053	010	Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.  He has caused him to suffer.
Isaiah	053	011	After the suffering of his soul, he will see the
Isaiah	053	012	Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,
Isaiah	054	001	Sing, barren, you who didn't bear; break forth into singing,
Isaiah	054	002	Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch
Isaiah	054	003	For you shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left;
Isaiah	054	004	Don't be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed:
Isaiah	054	005	For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name:
Isaiah	054	006	For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved
Isaiah	054	007	For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies
Isaiah	054	008	In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment;
Isaiah	054	009	For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn
Isaiah	054	010	For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed;
Isaiah	054	011	You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold,
Isaiah	054	012	I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of
Isaiah	054	013	All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall
Isaiah	054	014	In righteousness shall you be established:  you shall be far
Isaiah	054	015	Behold, they may gather together, but not by me:  whoever shall
Isaiah	054	016	Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals,
Isaiah	054	017	No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every
Isaiah	055	001	Ho, everyone who thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has
Isaiah	055	002	Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your
Isaiah	055	003	Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live:
Isaiah	055	004	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,
Isaiah	055	005	Behold, you shall call a nation that you don't know;
Isaiah	055	006	Seek you Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while
Isaiah	055	007	let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
Isaiah	055	008	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
Isaiah	055	009	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
Isaiah	055	010	For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,
Isaiah	055	011	so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:
Isaiah	055	012	For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:
Isaiah	055	013	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree;
Isaiah	056	001	Thus says Yahweh, Keep you justice, and do righteousness;
Isaiah	056	002	Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds
Isaiah	056	003	Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh,
Isaiah	056	004	For thus says Yahweh of the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
Isaiah	056	005	To them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial
Isaiah	056	006	Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister
Isaiah	056	007	even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
Isaiah	056	008	The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet will
Isaiah	056	009	All you animals of the field, come to devour, [yes], all you
Isaiah	056	010	His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge;
Isaiah	056	011	Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough;
Isaiah	056	012	Come you, [say they], I will get wine, and we will fill
Isaiah	057	001	The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful
Isaiah	057	002	He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks
Isaiah	057	003	But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed
Isaiah	057	004	Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you
Isaiah	057	005	you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree;
Isaiah	057	006	Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion;
Isaiah	057	007	On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed;
Isaiah	057	008	Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial:
Isaiah	057	009	You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes,
Isaiah	057	010	You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn't say,
Isaiah	057	011	Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie,
Isaiah	057	012	I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works,
Isaiah	057	013	When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you;
Isaiah	057	014	He will say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up
Isaiah	057	015	For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,
Isaiah	057	016	For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry;
Isaiah	057	017	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him;
Isaiah	057	018	I have seen his ways, and will heal him:  I will lead him also,
Isaiah	057	019	I create the fruit of the lips:  Peace, peace, to him who is far
Isaiah	057	020	But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest,
Isaiah	057	021	There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.
Isaiah	058	001	Cry aloud, don't spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet,
Isaiah	058	002	Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways:
Isaiah	058	003	Why have we fasted, [say they], and you don't see? [why]
Isaiah	058	004	Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike
Isaiah	058	005	Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man
Isaiah	058	006	Isn't this the fast that I have chosen:  to loose the bonds
Isaiah	058	007	Isn't it to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring
Isaiah	058	008	Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your healing
Isaiah	058	009	Then shall you call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry,
Isaiah	058	010	and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy
Isaiah	058	011	and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul
Isaiah	058	012	Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places;
Isaiah	058	013	If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your
Isaiah	058	014	then shall you delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will
Isaiah	059	001	Behold, Yahweh's hand is not shortened, that it can't save;
Isaiah	059	002	but your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
Isaiah	059	003	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
Isaiah	059	004	None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth:
Isaiah	059	005	They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web:
Isaiah	059	006	Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
Isaiah	059	007	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:
Isaiah	059	008	The way of peace they don't know; and there is no justice
Isaiah	059	009	Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness
Isaiah	059	010	We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those
Isaiah	059	011	We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves:
Isaiah	059	012	For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins
Isaiah	059	013	transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following
Isaiah	059	014	Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off;
Isaiah	059	015	Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself
Isaiah	059	016	He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
Isaiah	059	017	He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation
Isaiah	059	018	According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,
Isaiah	059	019	So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west,
Isaiah	059	020	A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from
Isaiah	059	021	As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh:
Isaiah	060	001	Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of Yahweh
Isaiah	060	002	For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
Isaiah	060	003	Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness
Isaiah	060	004	Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  they all gather
Isaiah	060	005	Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill
Isaiah	060	006	The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries
Isaiah	060	007	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you,
Isaiah	060	008	Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
Isaiah	060	009	Surely the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of
Isaiah	060	010	Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall
Isaiah	060	011	Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be
Isaiah	060	012	For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;
Isaiah	060	013	The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine,
Isaiah	060	014	The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you;
Isaiah	060	015	Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man
Isaiah	060	016	You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast
Isaiah	060	017	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
Isaiah	060	018	Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor
Isaiah	060	019	The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness
Isaiah	060	020	Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon
Isaiah	060	021	Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit
Isaiah	060	022	The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one
Isaiah	061	001	The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed
Isaiah	061	002	to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance
Isaiah	061	003	to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them
Isaiah	061	004	They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
Isaiah	061	005	Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners
Isaiah	061	006	But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men shall call
Isaiah	061	007	Instead of your shame [you shall have] double; and instead
Isaiah	061	008	For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity;
Isaiah	061	009	Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring
Isaiah	061	010	I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
Isaiah	061	011	For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden
Isaiah	062	001	For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake
Isaiah	062	002	The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory,
Isaiah	062	003	You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh,
Isaiah	062	004	You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land
Isaiah	062	005	For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you;
Isaiah	062	006	I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall
Isaiah	062	007	and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes
Isaiah	062	008	Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
Isaiah	062	009	but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh;
Isaiah	062	010	Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people;
Isaiah	062	011	Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth,
Isaiah	062	012	They shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh:
Isaiah	063	001	Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from
Isaiah	063	002	Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him
Isaiah	063	003	I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was
Isaiah	063	004	For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my
Isaiah	063	005	I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there
Isaiah	063	006	I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk
Isaiah	063	007	I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh,
Isaiah	063	008	For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will
Isaiah	063	009	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
Isaiah	063	010	But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit:
Isaiah	063	011	Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people,
Isaiah	063	012	who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses?
Isaiah	063	013	who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness,
Isaiah	063	014	As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit
Isaiah	063	015	Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your
Isaiah	063	016	For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn't know us,
Isaiah	063	017	O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways,
Isaiah	063	018	Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while:
Isaiah	063	019	We are become as they over whom you never bear rule,
Isaiah	064	001	Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down,
Isaiah	064	002	as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes
Isaiah	064	003	When you did terrible things which we didn't look for,
Isaiah	064	004	For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
Isaiah	064	005	You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember
Isaiah	064	006	For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our
Isaiah	064	007	There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself
Isaiah	064	008	But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you
Isaiah	064	009	Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever:
Isaiah	064	010	Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become
Isaiah	064	011	Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you,
Isaiah	064	012	Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? will you
Isaiah	065	001	I am inquired of by those who didn't ask; I am found by those
Isaiah	065	002	I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people,
Isaiah	065	003	a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing
Isaiah	065	004	who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places;
Isaiah	065	005	who say, Stand by yourself, don't come near to me,
Isaiah	065	006	Behold, it is written before me:  I will not keep silence,
Isaiah	065	007	your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
Isaiah	065	008	Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
Isaiah	065	009	I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
Isaiah	065	010	Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place
Isaiah	065	011	But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain,
Isaiah	065	012	I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down
Isaiah	065	013	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat,
Isaiah	065	014	behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall
Isaiah	065	015	You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen;
Isaiah	065	016	so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself
Isaiah	065	017	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former
Isaiah	065	018	But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;
Isaiah	065	019	I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people;
Isaiah	065	020	There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old
Isaiah	065	021	They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
Isaiah	065	022	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
Isaiah	065	023	They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity;
Isaiah	065	024	It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer;
Isaiah	065	025	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
Isaiah	066	001	Thus says Yahweh, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:
Isaiah	066	002	For all these things has my hand made, and [so] all these things
Isaiah	066	003	He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices
Isaiah	066	004	I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
Isaiah	066	005	Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word:
Isaiah	066	006	A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple,
Isaiah	066	007	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
Isaiah	066	008	Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things?
Isaiah	066	009	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
Isaiah	066	010	Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who
Isaiah	066	011	that you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of
Isaiah	066	012	For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
Isaiah	066	013	As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you;
Isaiah	066	014	You shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice,
Isaiah	066	015	For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall
Isaiah	066	016	For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword,
Isaiah	066	017	Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go]
Isaiah	066	018	For I [know] their works and their thoughts:  [the time] comes,
Isaiah	066	019	I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape
Isaiah	066	020	They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an
Isaiah	066	021	Of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.
Isaiah	066	022	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
Isaiah	066	023	It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from
Isaiah	066	024	They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men
Jeremiah	001	001	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
Jeremiah	001	002	to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son
Jeremiah	001	003	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	001	004	Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	001	005	Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you
Jeremiah	001	006	Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, I don't know how to speak;
Jeremiah	001	007	But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whoever I
Jeremiah	001	008	Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to
Jeremiah	001	009	Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh
Jeremiah	001	010	behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over
Jeremiah	001	011	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah,
Jeremiah	001	012	Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen:  for I watch
Jeremiah	001	013	The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What see you?
Jeremiah	001	014	Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil shall break
Jeremiah	001	015	For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms
Jeremiah	001	016	I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness,
Jeremiah	001	017	You therefore gird up your waist, and arise, and speak
Jeremiah	001	018	For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city,
Jeremiah	001	019	They shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you:
Jeremiah	002	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	002	002	Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says
Jeremiah	002	003	Israel [was] holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase:
Jeremiah	002	004	Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families
Jeremiah	002	005	thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
Jeremiah	002	006	Neither said they, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out
Jeremiah	002	007	I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and
Jeremiah	002	008	The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle
Jeremiah	002	009	Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and with
Jeremiah	002	010	For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send
Jeremiah	002	011	Has a nation changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my
Jeremiah	002	012	Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
Jeremiah	002	013	For my people have committed two evils:  they have forsaken me,
Jeremiah	002	014	Is Israel a servant? is he a native-born [slave]? why is
Jeremiah	002	015	The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made
Jeremiah	002	016	The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown
Jeremiah	002	017	Haven't you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken
Jeremiah	002	018	Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters
Jeremiah	002	019	Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding
Jeremiah	002	020	For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds;
Jeremiah	002	021	Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed:
Jeremiah	002	022	For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,
Jeremiah	002	023	How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after
Jeremiah	002	024	a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind
Jeremiah	002	025	Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst:
Jeremiah	002	026	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house
Jeremiah	002	027	who tell a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have
Jeremiah	002	028	But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise,
Jeremiah	002	029	Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed
Jeremiah	002	030	In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction:
Jeremiah	002	031	Generation, see the word of Yahweh.  Have I been a wilderness
Jeremiah	002	032	Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet
Jeremiah	002	033	How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked
Jeremiah	002	034	Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls
Jeremiah	002	035	Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away
Jeremiah	002	036	Why go you about so much to change your way? you shall be
Jeremiah	002	037	From there also shall you go forth, with your hands on your head:
Jeremiah	003	001	They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
Jeremiah	003	002	Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have
Jeremiah	003	003	Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has
Jeremiah	003	004	Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are
Jeremiah	003	005	Will he retain [his anger] forever? will he keep it to the end?
Jeremiah	003	006	Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king,
Jeremiah	003	007	I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me;
Jeremiah	003	008	I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had
Jeremiah	003	009	It happened through the lightness of her prostitution,
Jeremiah	003	010	Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned
Jeremiah	003	011	Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more
Jeremiah	003	012	Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
Jeremiah	003	013	Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed
Jeremiah	003	014	Return, backsliding children, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you:
Jeremiah	003	015	and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall
Jeremiah	003	016	It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased
Jeremiah	003	017	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh;
Jeremiah	003	018	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
Jeremiah	003	019	But I said, How I will put you among the children, and give
Jeremiah	003	020	Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have
Jeremiah	003	021	A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and]
Jeremiah	003	022	Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.
Jeremiah	003	023	Truly in vain is [the help that is looked for] from the hills,
Jeremiah	003	024	But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers
Jeremiah	003	025	Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us;
Jeremiah	004	001	If you will return, Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me,
Jeremiah	004	002	and you shall swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice,
Jeremiah	004	003	For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up
Jeremiah	004	004	Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins
Jeremiah	004	005	Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say,
Jeremiah	004	006	Set up a standard toward Zion:  flee for safety, don't stay;
Jeremiah	004	007	A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations;
Jeremiah	004	008	For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail;
Jeremiah	004	009	It shall happen at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart
Jeremiah	004	010	Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! surely you have greatly deceived
Jeremiah	004	011	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot
Jeremiah	004	012	a full wind from these shall come for me:  now will I also utter
Jeremiah	004	013	Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall
Jeremiah	004	014	Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved.
Jeremiah	004	015	For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from
Jeremiah	004	016	make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
Jeremiah	004	017	As keepers of a field are they against her round about,
Jeremiah	004	018	Your way and your doings have procured these things to you;
Jeremiah	004	019	My anguish, my anguish!  I am pained at my very heart;
Jeremiah	004	020	Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is
Jeremiah	004	021	How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound
Jeremiah	004	022	For my people are foolish, they don't know me; they are
Jeremiah	004	023	I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void;
Jeremiah	004	024	I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills
Jeremiah	004	025	I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds
Jeremiah	004	026	I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all
Jeremiah	004	027	For thus says Yahweh, The whole land shall be a desolation;
Jeremiah	004	028	For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
Jeremiah	004	029	Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers;
Jeremiah	004	030	You, when you are made desolate, what will you do?
Jeremiah	004	031	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
Jeremiah	005	001	Run you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem,
Jeremiah	005	002	Though they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.
Jeremiah	005	003	O Yahweh, don't your eyes look on truth? you have stricken them,
Jeremiah	005	004	Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they
Jeremiah	005	005	I will get me to the great men, and will speak to them;
Jeremiah	005	006	Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf
Jeremiah	005	007	How can I pardon you? your children have forsaken me, and sworn
Jeremiah	005	008	They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed
Jeremiah	005	009	Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and shall
Jeremiah	005	010	Go up on her walls, and destroy; but don't make a full end:
Jeremiah	005	011	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
Jeremiah	005	012	They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not he; neither shall
Jeremiah	005	013	and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them:
Jeremiah	005	014	Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, Because you speak
Jeremiah	005	015	Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel,
Jeremiah	005	016	Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.
Jeremiah	005	017	They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, [which] your sons
Jeremiah	005	018	But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full
Jeremiah	005	019	It shall happen, when you shall say, Why has Yahweh our God
Jeremiah	005	020	Declare you this in the house of Jacob, and publish it
Jeremiah	005	021	Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding;
Jeremiah	005	022	Don't you fear me? says Yahweh:  won't you tremble at my presence,
Jeremiah	005	023	But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart;
Jeremiah	005	024	Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God,
Jeremiah	005	025	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins
Jeremiah	005	026	For among my people are found wicked men:  they watch,
Jeremiah	005	027	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
Jeremiah	005	028	They are grew fat, they shine:  yes, they overpass in deeds
Jeremiah	005	029	Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my
Jeremiah	005	030	A wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:
Jeremiah	005	031	the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule
Jeremiah	006	001	Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst
Jeremiah	006	002	The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
Jeremiah	006	003	Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall
Jeremiah	006	004	Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
Jeremiah	006	005	Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
Jeremiah	006	006	For thus has Yahweh of Armies said, Hew you down trees, and cast
Jeremiah	006	007	As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness:
Jeremiah	006	008	Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you;
Jeremiah	006	009	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, They shall thoroughly glean
Jeremiah	006	010	To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold,
Jeremiah	006	011	Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary
Jeremiah	006	012	Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their
Jeremiah	006	013	For from the least of them even to the greatest of them
Jeremiah	006	014	They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly,
Jeremiah	006	015	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
Jeremiah	006	016	Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask
Jeremiah	006	017	I set watchmen over you, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet;
Jeremiah	006	018	Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation,
Jeremiah	006	019	Hear, earth:  behold, I will bring evil on this people,
Jeremiah	006	020	To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba,
Jeremiah	006	021	Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks
Jeremiah	006	022	Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country;
Jeremiah	006	023	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;
Jeremiah	006	024	We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble:
Jeremiah	006	025	Don't go forth into the field, nor walk by the way;
Jeremiah	006	026	Daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow
Jeremiah	006	027	I have made you a tester of metals [and] a fortress among my people;
Jeremiah	006	028	They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders;
Jeremiah	006	029	The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire:
Jeremiah	006	030	Refuse silver shall men them, because Yahweh has rejected them.
Jeremiah	007	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
Jeremiah	007	002	Stand in the gate of Yahweh's house, and proclaim there
Jeremiah	007	003	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
Jeremiah	007	004	Don't you trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Yahweh,
Jeremiah	007	005	For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings;
Jeremiah	007	006	if you don't oppress the foreigner, the fatherless,
Jeremiah	007	007	then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
Jeremiah	007	008	Behold, you trust in lying words, that can't profit.
Jeremiah	007	009	Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
Jeremiah	007	010	and come and stand before me in this house, which is called
Jeremiah	007	011	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers
Jeremiah	007	012	But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused
Jeremiah	007	013	Now, because you have done all these works, says Yahweh, and I
Jeremiah	007	014	therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name,
Jeremiah	007	015	I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
Jeremiah	007	016	Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up
Jeremiah	007	017	Don't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in
Jeremiah	007	018	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,
Jeremiah	007	019	Do they provoke me to anger? says Yahweh; [do they] not
Jeremiah	007	020	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, my anger and my
Jeremiah	007	021	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Add your burnt
Jeremiah	007	022	For I didn't speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day
Jeremiah	007	023	but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice,
Jeremiah	007	024	But they didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in [their
Jeremiah	007	025	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
Jeremiah	007	026	yet they didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made
Jeremiah	007	027	You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not
Jeremiah	007	028	You shall tell them, This is the nation that has not listened
Jeremiah	007	029	Cut off your hair, [Jerusalem], and cast it away, and take up
Jeremiah	007	030	For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,
Jeremiah	007	031	They have built the high places of Topheth, which is
Jeremiah	007	032	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall
Jeremiah	007	033	The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds
Jeremiah	007	034	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
Jeremiah	008	001	At that time, says Yahweh, they shall bring out the bones
Jeremiah	008	002	and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon,
Jeremiah	008	003	Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
Jeremiah	008	004	Moreover you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  Shall men fall,
Jeremiah	008	005	Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual
Jeremiah	008	006	I listened and heard, but they didn't speak aright:
Jeremiah	008	007	Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times;
Jeremiah	008	008	How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us?
Jeremiah	008	009	The wise men are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken:
Jeremiah	008	010	Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their
Jeremiah	008	011	They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
Jeremiah	008	012	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
Jeremiah	008	013	I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh:  there shall be no
Jeremiah	008	014	Why do we sit still?  Assemble yourselves, and let us enter
Jeremiah	008	015	We looked for peace, but no good came; [and] for a time of healing,
Jeremiah	008	016	The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan:  at the sound
Jeremiah	008	017	For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will
Jeremiah	008	018	Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow!  My heart
Jeremiah	008	019	Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land
Jeremiah	008	020	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
Jeremiah	008	021	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt:
Jeremiah	008	022	Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why
Jeremiah	009	001	Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears,
Jeremiah	009	002	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men;
Jeremiah	009	003	They bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood;
Jeremiah	009	004	Take you heed everyone of his neighbor, and don't you trust
Jeremiah	009	005	They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak
Jeremiah	009	006	Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
Jeremiah	009	007	Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will melt them,
Jeremiah	009	008	Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit:
Jeremiah	009	009	Shall I not visit them for these things? says Yahweh;
Jeremiah	009	010	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing,
Jeremiah	009	011	I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I
Jeremiah	009	012	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is]
Jeremiah	009	013	Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set
Jeremiah	009	014	but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart,
Jeremiah	009	015	therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I
Jeremiah	009	016	I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor
Jeremiah	009	017	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Consider you, and call for the mourning
Jeremiah	009	018	and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us,
Jeremiah	009	019	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined!
Jeremiah	009	020	Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you women, and let your ear receive
Jeremiah	009	021	For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces;
Jeremiah	009	022	Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung
Jeremiah	009	023	Thus says Yahweh, Don't let the wise man glory in his wisdom,
Jeremiah	009	024	but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding,
Jeremiah	009	025	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all
Jeremiah	009	026	Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab,
Jeremiah	010	001	Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!
Jeremiah	010	002	Thus says Yahweh, "Don't learn the way of the nations,
Jeremiah	010	003	For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree
Jeremiah	010	004	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
Jeremiah	010	005	They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and don't speak:
Jeremiah	010	006	There is none like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name
Jeremiah	010	007	Who should not fear you, King of the nations? for to you does
Jeremiah	010	008	But they are together brutish and foolish:  the instruction
Jeremiah	010	009	There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,
Jeremiah	010	010	But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God,
Jeremiah	010	011	Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made
Jeremiah	010	012	He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world
Jeremiah	010	013	when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
Jeremiah	010	014	Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;
Jeremiah	010	015	They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their
Jeremiah	010	016	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former
Jeremiah	010	017	Gather up your wares out of the land, you who abide in the siege.
Jeremiah	010	018	For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants
Jeremiah	010	019	Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous:
Jeremiah	010	020	My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken:
Jeremiah	010	021	For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired
Jeremiah	010	022	The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out
Jeremiah	010	023	Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself:
Jeremiah	010	024	Yahweh, correct me, but in measure:  not in your anger,
Jeremiah	010	025	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you,
Jeremiah	011	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
Jeremiah	011	002	Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah,
Jeremiah	011	003	and say you to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Cursed be
Jeremiah	011	004	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them
Jeremiah	011	005	that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers,
Jeremiah	011	006	Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah,
Jeremiah	011	007	For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I
Jeremiah	011	008	Yet they didn't obey, nor turn their ear, but walked
Jeremiah	011	009	Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,
Jeremiah	011	010	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
Jeremiah	011	011	Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them,
Jeremiah	011	012	Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
Jeremiah	011	013	For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah;
Jeremiah	011	014	Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up cry
Jeremiah	011	015	What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked
Jeremiah	011	016	Yahweh called your name, A green olive tree, beautiful with
Jeremiah	011	017	For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil
Jeremiah	011	018	Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it:  then you shown
Jeremiah	011	019	But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter;
Jeremiah	011	020	But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, who tests
Jeremiah	011	021	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth,
Jeremiah	011	022	therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will punish them:
Jeremiah	011	023	and there shall be no remnant to them:  for I will bring evil
Jeremiah	012	001	Righteous are you, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet would
Jeremiah	012	002	You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow,
Jeremiah	012	003	But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you:
Jeremiah	012	004	How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole
Jeremiah	012	005	If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you,
Jeremiah	012	006	For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they
Jeremiah	012	007	I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage;
Jeremiah	012	008	My heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest:
Jeremiah	012	009	Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds
Jeremiah	012	010	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden
Jeremiah	012	011	They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate;
Jeremiah	012	012	Destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;
Jeremiah	012	013	They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns;
Jeremiah	012	014	Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch
Jeremiah	012	015	It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return
Jeremiah	012	016	It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways
Jeremiah	012	017	But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation,
Jeremiah	013	001	Thus says Yahweh to me, Go, and buy you a linen belt, and put
Jeremiah	013	002	So I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh, and put
Jeremiah	013	003	The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying,
Jeremiah	013	004	Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist,
Jeremiah	013	005	So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.
Jeremiah	013	006	It happened after many days, that Yahweh said to me, Arise,
Jeremiah	013	007	Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from
Jeremiah	013	008	Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	013	009	Thus says Yahweh, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah,
Jeremiah	013	010	This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in
Jeremiah	013	011	For as the belt cleaves to the waist of a man, so have I caused
Jeremiah	013	012	Therefore you shall speak to them this word:  Thus says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	013	013	Then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will fill
Jeremiah	013	014	I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
Jeremiah	013	015	Hear you, and give ear; don't be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.
Jeremiah	013	016	Give glory to Yahweh your God, before he cause darkness,
Jeremiah	013	017	But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret
Jeremiah	013	018	Say you to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves,
Jeremiah	013	019	The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them:
Jeremiah	013	020	Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north:
Jeremiah	013	021	What will you say, when he shall set over you as head those
Jeremiah	013	022	If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me?
Jeremiah	013	023	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
Jeremiah	013	024	Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away,
Jeremiah	013	025	This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh;
Jeremiah	013	026	Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face,
Jeremiah	013	027	I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries,
Jeremiah	014	001	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
Jeremiah	014	002	Judah mourns, and the gates of it languish, they sit in black
Jeremiah	014	003	Their nobles send their little ones to the waters:
Jeremiah	014	004	Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain
Jeremiah	014	005	Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes [her young],
Jeremiah	014	006	The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air
Jeremiah	014	007	Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for
Jeremiah	014	008	You hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble,
Jeremiah	014	009	Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can't
Jeremiah	014	010	Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander;
Jeremiah	014	011	Yahweh said to me, Don't pray for this people for [their] good.
Jeremiah	014	012	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
Jeremiah	014	013	Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them,
Jeremiah	014	014	Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name;
Jeremiah	014	015	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets
Jeremiah	014	016	The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
Jeremiah	014	017	You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with
Jeremiah	014	018	If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with
Jeremiah	014	019	Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion?
Jeremiah	014	020	We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity
Jeremiah	014	021	Do not abhor [us], for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne
Jeremiah	014	022	Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can
Jeremiah	015	001	Then said Yahweh to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood
Jeremiah	015	002	It shall happen, when they tell you, Where shall we go
Jeremiah	015	003	I will appoint over them four kinds, says Yahweh:
Jeremiah	015	004	I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms
Jeremiah	015	005	For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan
Jeremiah	015	006	You have rejected me, says Yahweh, you are gone backward:
Jeremiah	015	007	I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land;
Jeremiah	015	008	Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas;
Jeremiah	015	009	She who has borne seven languishes; she has given up the spirit;
Jeremiah	015	010	Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man
Jeremiah	015	011	Yahweh said, Most certainly I will strengthen you for good;
Jeremiah	015	012	Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
Jeremiah	015	013	Your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil
Jeremiah	015	014	I will make [them] to pass with your enemies into a land
Jeremiah	015	015	Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me
Jeremiah	015	016	Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were
Jeremiah	015	017	I didn't sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced;
Jeremiah	015	018	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses
Jeremiah	015	019	Therefore thus says Yahweh, If you return, then will I bring
Jeremiah	015	020	I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; and they
Jeremiah	015	021	I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will
Jeremiah	016	001	The word of Yahweh came also to me, saying,
Jeremiah	016	002	You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters,
Jeremiah	016	003	For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning
Jeremiah	016	004	They shall die grievous deaths:  they shall not be lamented,
Jeremiah	016	005	For thus says Yahweh, Don't enter into the house of mourning,
Jeremiah	016	006	Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not
Jeremiah	016	007	neither shall men break [bread] for them in mourning,
Jeremiah	016	008	You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them,
Jeremiah	016	009	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I will
Jeremiah	016	010	It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words,
Jeremiah	016	011	Then shall you tell them, Because your fathers have forsaken me,
Jeremiah	016	012	and you have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold,
Jeremiah	016	013	therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land
Jeremiah	016	014	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall
Jeremiah	016	015	but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel
Jeremiah	016	016	Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Yahweh, and they
Jeremiah	016	017	For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from
Jeremiah	016	018	First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double,
Jeremiah	016	019	Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day
Jeremiah	016	020	Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?
Jeremiah	016	021	Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I
Jeremiah	017	001	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, [and] with the point
Jeremiah	017	002	while their children remember their altars and their Asherim
Jeremiah	017	003	My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your
Jeremiah	017	004	You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage
Jeremiah	017	005	Thus says Yahweh:  Cursed is the man who trusts in man,
Jeremiah	017	006	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
Jeremiah	017	007	Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh, and whose trust Yahweh is.
Jeremiah	017	008	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads
Jeremiah	017	009	The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is
Jeremiah	017	010	I, Yahweh, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give
Jeremiah	017	011	As the partridge that sits on [eggs] which she has not laid,
Jeremiah	017	012	A glorious throne, [set] on high from the beginning,
Jeremiah	017	013	Yahweh, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall
Jeremiah	017	014	Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
Jeremiah	017	015	Behold, they tell me, Where is the word of Yahweh? let
Jeremiah	017	016	As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you;
Jeremiah	017	017	Don't be a terror to me:  you are my refuge in the day of evil.
Jeremiah	017	018	Let them be disappointed who persecute me, but let not me
Jeremiah	017	019	Thus said Yahweh to me:  Go, and stand in the gate of the children
Jeremiah	017	020	and tell them, Hear you the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah,
Jeremiah	017	021	Thus says Yahweh, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden
Jeremiah	017	022	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath
Jeremiah	017	023	But they didn't listen, neither turn their ear, but made
Jeremiah	017	024	It shall happen, if you diligently listen to me, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	017	025	then shall there enter in by the gates of this city
Jeremiah	017	026	They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places
Jeremiah	017	027	But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy,
Jeremiah	018	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
Jeremiah	018	002	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause
Jeremiah	018	003	Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was
Jeremiah	018	004	When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand
Jeremiah	018	005	Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	018	006	House of Israel, can't I do with you as this potter? says Yahweh.
Jeremiah	018	007	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
Jeremiah	018	008	if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil,
Jeremiah	018	009	At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
Jeremiah	018	010	if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey
Jeremiah	018	011	Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants
Jeremiah	018	012	But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our
Jeremiah	018	013	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Ask you now among the nations,
Jeremiah	018	014	Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? [or]
Jeremiah	018	015	For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to
Jeremiah	018	016	to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing;
Jeremiah	018	017	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy;
Jeremiah	018	018	Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
Jeremiah	018	019	Give heed to me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who
Jeremiah	018	020	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit
Jeremiah	018	021	Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give
Jeremiah	018	022	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring
Jeremiah	018	023	Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me;
Jeremiah	019	001	Thus said Yahweh, Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle,
Jeremiah	019	002	and go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by
Jeremiah	019	003	and say, Hear you the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah,
Jeremiah	019	004	Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
Jeremiah	019	005	and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons
Jeremiah	019	006	therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that this place
Jeremiah	019	007	I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place;
Jeremiah	019	008	I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing;
Jeremiah	019	009	I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and
Jeremiah	019	010	Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men
Jeremiah	019	011	and shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Even so will I
Jeremiah	019	012	Thus will I do to this place, says Yahweh, and to the inhabitants
Jeremiah	019	013	and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings
Jeremiah	019	014	Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him
Jeremiah	019	015	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will
Jeremiah	020	001	Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer
Jeremiah	020	002	Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him
Jeremiah	020	003	It happened on the next day, that Pashhur brought forth
Jeremiah	020	004	For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror
Jeremiah	020	005	Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains
Jeremiah	020	006	You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity;
Jeremiah	020	007	Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded;
Jeremiah	020	008	For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and
Jeremiah	020	009	If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more
Jeremiah	020	010	For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side.
Jeremiah	020	011	But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one:  therefore my
Jeremiah	020	012	But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees
Jeremiah	020	013	Sing to Yahweh, praise you Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul
Jeremiah	020	014	Cursed be the day in which I was born:  don't let the day
Jeremiah	020	015	Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy
Jeremiah	020	016	Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,
Jeremiah	020	017	because he didn't kill me from the womb; and so my mother
Jeremiah	020	018	Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,
Jeremiah	021	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when king Zedekiah
Jeremiah	021	002	Please inquire of Yahweh for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king
Jeremiah	021	003	Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall you tell Zedekiah:
Jeremiah	021	004	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back
Jeremiah	021	005	I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
Jeremiah	021	006	I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and animal:
Jeremiah	021	007	Afterward, says Yahweh, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah,
Jeremiah	021	008	To this people you shall say, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I set
Jeremiah	021	009	He who remains in this city shall die by the sword,
Jeremiah	021	010	For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good,
Jeremiah	021	011	Touching the house of the king of Judah, hear you the word of Yahweh:
Jeremiah	021	012	House of David, thus says Yahweh, Execute justice in the morning,
Jeremiah	021	013	Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,
Jeremiah	021	014	I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
Jeremiah	022	001	Thus said Yahweh:  Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
Jeremiah	022	002	Say, Hear the word of Yahweh, king of Judah, who sits on
Jeremiah	022	003	Thus says Yahweh:  Execute you justice and righteousness,
Jeremiah	022	004	For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by
Jeremiah	022	005	But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,
Jeremiah	022	006	For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the king
Jeremiah	022	007	I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with his weapons;
Jeremiah	022	008	Many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man
Jeremiah	022	009	Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant
Jeremiah	022	010	Don't you weep for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep
Jeremiah	022	011	For thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	022	012	But in the place where they have led him captive, there shall
Jeremiah	022	013	Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers
Jeremiah	022	014	who says, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers,
Jeremiah	022	015	Shall you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar?
Jeremiah	022	016	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well.
Jeremiah	022	017	But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness,
Jeremiah	022	018	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	022	019	He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast
Jeremiah	022	020	Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan,
Jeremiah	022	021	I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear.
Jeremiah	022	022	The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers
Jeremiah	022	023	Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes your nest in the cedars,
Jeremiah	022	024	As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
Jeremiah	022	025	and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life,
Jeremiah	022	026	I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you,
Jeremiah	022	027	But to the land whereunto their soul longs to return,
Jeremiah	022	028	Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel
Jeremiah	022	029	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.
Jeremiah	022	030	Thus says Yahweh, Write you this man childless, a man
Jeremiah	023	001	Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my
Jeremiah	023	002	Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, against the
Jeremiah	023	003	I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries
Jeremiah	023	004	I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them;
Jeremiah	023	005	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will raise to David
Jeremiah	023	006	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely;
Jeremiah	023	007	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that they shall
Jeremiah	023	008	but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the seed
Jeremiah	023	009	Concerning the prophets.  My heart within me is broken,
Jeremiah	023	010	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
Jeremiah	023	011	for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house
Jeremiah	023	012	Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places
Jeremiah	023	013	I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied
Jeremiah	023	014	In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing:
Jeremiah	023	015	Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets:
Jeremiah	023	016	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Don't listen to the words of
Jeremiah	023	017	They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said,
Jeremiah	023	018	For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should
Jeremiah	023	019	Behold, the storm of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, yes,
Jeremiah	023	020	The anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed,
Jeremiah	023	021	I sent not these prophets, yet they ran:  I didn't speak to them,
Jeremiah	023	022	But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people
Jeremiah	023	023	Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah	023	024	Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see
Jeremiah	023	025	I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies
Jeremiah	023	026	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies,
Jeremiah	023	027	who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams
Jeremiah	023	028	The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream;
Jeremiah	023	029	Isn't my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer
Jeremiah	023	030	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	023	031	Behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who use
Jeremiah	023	032	Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	023	033	When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you,
Jeremiah	023	034	As for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say,
Jeremiah	023	035	Thus shall you say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to
Jeremiah	023	036	The burden of Yahweh shall you mention no more:  for every
Jeremiah	023	037	Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has Yahweh answered
Jeremiah	023	038	But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus
Jeremiah	023	039	therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast
Jeremiah	023	040	and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a
Jeremiah	024	001	Yahweh shown me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before
Jeremiah	024	002	One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe;
Jeremiah	024	003	Then said Yahweh to me, What see you, Jeremiah?  I said, Figs;
Jeremiah	024	004	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	024	005	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  Like these good figs,
Jeremiah	024	006	For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again
Jeremiah	024	007	I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh:
Jeremiah	024	008	As the bad figs, which can't be eaten, they are so bad,
Jeremiah	024	009	I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among
Jeremiah	024	010	I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
Jeremiah	025	001	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah,
Jeremiah	025	002	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah,
Jeremiah	025	003	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon,
Jeremiah	025	004	Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets,
Jeremiah	025	005	saying, Return you now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil
Jeremiah	025	006	and don't go after other gods to serve them or worship them,
Jeremiah	025	007	Yet you have not listened to me, says Yahweh; that you may provoke
Jeremiah	025	008	Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Because you have not
Jeremiah	025	009	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
Jeremiah	025	010	Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice
Jeremiah	025	011	This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
Jeremiah	025	012	It shall happen, when seventy years are accomplished,
Jeremiah	025	013	I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced
Jeremiah	025	014	For many nations and great kings shall make bondservants of them,
Jeremiah	025	015	For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me:  take this cup
Jeremiah	025	016	They shall drink, and reel back and forth, and be mad,
Jeremiah	025	017	Then took I the cup at Yahweh's hand, and made all the nations
Jeremiah	025	018	[to wit], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
Jeremiah	025	019	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes,
Jeremiah	025	020	and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz,
Jeremiah	025	021	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
Jeremiah	025	022	and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon,
Jeremiah	025	023	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all who have the corners [of
Jeremiah	025	024	and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed
Jeremiah	025	025	and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam,
Jeremiah	025	026	and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another;
Jeremiah	025	027	You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
Jeremiah	025	028	It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand
Jeremiah	025	029	For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is
Jeremiah	025	030	Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and tell them,
Jeremiah	025	031	A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Yahweh
Jeremiah	025	032	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, evil shall go forth
Jeremiah	025	033	The slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end
Jeremiah	025	034	Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow [in ashes],
Jeremiah	025	035	The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
Jeremiah	025	036	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the
Jeremiah	025	037	The peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce
Jeremiah	025	038	He has left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an
Jeremiah	026	001	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	026	002	Thus says Yahweh:  Stand in the court of Yahweh's house,
Jeremiah	026	003	It may be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way;
Jeremiah	026	004	You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh:  If you will not listen
Jeremiah	026	005	to listen to the words of my servants the prophets,
Jeremiah	026	006	then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this
Jeremiah	026	007	The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
Jeremiah	026	008	It happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all
Jeremiah	026	009	Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house
Jeremiah	026	010	When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up
Jeremiah	026	011	Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes
Jeremiah	026	012	Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people,
Jeremiah	026	013	Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice
Jeremiah	026	014	But as for me, behold, I am in your hand:  do with me as is
Jeremiah	026	015	Only know for certain that, if you put me to death,
Jeremiah	026	016	Then said the princes and all the people to the priests
Jeremiah	026	017	Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke
Jeremiah	026	018	Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king
Jeremiah	026	019	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death?
Jeremiah	026	020	There was also a man who prophesied in the name
Jeremiah	026	021	and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men,
Jeremiah	026	022	and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan
Jeremiah	026	023	and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him
Jeremiah	026	024	But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,
Jeremiah	027	001	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	027	002	Thus says Yahweh to me:  Make you bonds and bars, and put them
Jeremiah	027	003	and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
Jeremiah	027	004	and give them a charge to their masters, saying, Thus says Yahweh
Jeremiah	027	005	I have made the earth, the men and the animals that are on the surface
Jeremiah	027	006	Now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
Jeremiah	027	007	All the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son,
Jeremiah	027	008	It shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not
Jeremiah	027	009	But as for you, don't you listen to your prophets, nor to
Jeremiah	027	010	for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land,
Jeremiah	027	011	But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke
Jeremiah	027	012	I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
Jeremiah	027	013	Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine,
Jeremiah	027	014	Don't listen to the words of the prophets who speak
Jeremiah	027	015	For I have not sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy
Jeremiah	027	016	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying,
Jeremiah	027	017	Don't listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
Jeremiah	027	018	But if they be prophets, and if the word of Yahweh be with them,
Jeremiah	027	019	For thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars,
Jeremiah	027	020	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn't take,
Jeremiah	027	021	yes, thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel,
Jeremiah	027	022	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be,
Jeremiah	028	001	It happened the same year, in the beginning of the reign of
Jeremiah	028	002	Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, I have
Jeremiah	028	003	Within two full years will I bring again into this place
Jeremiah	028	004	and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son
Jeremiah	028	005	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah
Jeremiah	028	006	even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen:  Yahweh do so;
Jeremiah	028	007	Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears,
Jeremiah	028	008	The prophets who have been before me and before you of old
Jeremiah	028	009	The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet
Jeremiah	028	010	Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet
Jeremiah	028	011	Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus
Jeremiah	028	012	Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that Hananiah
Jeremiah	028	013	Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh:  You have
Jeremiah	028	014	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  I have put
Jeremiah	028	015	Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet,
Jeremiah	028	016	Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will send you away
Jeremiah	028	017	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah	029	001	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah
Jeremiah	029	002	(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the eunuchs,
Jeremiah	029	003	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
Jeremiah	029	004	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, to all
Jeremiah	029	005	Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens,
Jeremiah	029	006	Take wives, and father sons and daughters; and take wives
Jeremiah	029	007	Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried
Jeremiah	029	008	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Don't let
Jeremiah	029	009	For they prophesy falsely to you in my name:  I have not
Jeremiah	029	010	For thus says Yahweh, After seventy years are accomplished
Jeremiah	029	011	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	029	012	You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me,
Jeremiah	029	013	You shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me
Jeremiah	029	014	I will be found by you, says Yahweh, and I will turn again
Jeremiah	029	015	Because you have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
Jeremiah	029	016	thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne
Jeremiah	029	017	thus says Yahweh of Armies; Behold, I will send on them the sword,
Jeremiah	029	018	I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine,
Jeremiah	029	019	because they have not listened to my words, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	029	020	Hear you therefore the word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity,
Jeremiah	029	021	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab
Jeremiah	029	022	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah
Jeremiah	029	023	because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed
Jeremiah	029	024	Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
Jeremiah	029	025	Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying,
Jeremiah	029	026	Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,
Jeremiah	029	027	Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth,
Jeremiah	029	028	because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, [The captivity]
Jeremiah	029	029	Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
Jeremiah	029	030	Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	029	031	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh
Jeremiah	029	032	therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
Jeremiah	030	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
Jeremiah	030	002	Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write you all
Jeremiah	030	003	For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again
Jeremiah	030	004	These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel
Jeremiah	030	005	For thus says Yahweh:  We have heard a voice of trembling,
Jeremiah	030	006	Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child:
Jeremiah	030	007	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it:
Jeremiah	030	008	It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I
Jeremiah	030	009	but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king,
Jeremiah	030	010	Therefore don't you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh;
Jeremiah	030	011	For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you:  for I will make
Jeremiah	030	012	For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable,
Jeremiah	030	013	There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up:
Jeremiah	030	014	All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you:
Jeremiah	030	015	Why cry you for your hurt? your pain is incurable:
Jeremiah	030	016	Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all
Jeremiah	030	017	For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you
Jeremiah	030	018	Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will turn again the captivity
Jeremiah	030	019	Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who
Jeremiah	030	020	Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation
Jeremiah	030	021	Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed
Jeremiah	030	022	You shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Jeremiah	030	023	Behold, the storm of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth,
Jeremiah	030	024	The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed,
Jeremiah	031	001	At that time, says Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families
Jeremiah	031	002	Thus says Yahweh, The people who were left of the sword found
Jeremiah	031	003	Yahweh appeared of old to me, [saying], Yes, I have loved you
Jeremiah	031	004	Again will I build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel:
Jeremiah	031	005	Again shall you plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria;
Jeremiah	031	006	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the hills
Jeremiah	031	007	For thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
Jeremiah	031	008	Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
Jeremiah	031	009	They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them:
Jeremiah	031	010	Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the islands
Jeremiah	031	011	For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand
Jeremiah	031	012	They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow
Jeremiah	031	013	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men
Jeremiah	031	014	I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
Jeremiah	031	015	Thus says Yahweh:  A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation,
Jeremiah	031	016	Thus says Yahweh:  Refrain your voice from weeping, and your
Jeremiah	031	017	There is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and [your]
Jeremiah	031	018	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus],
Jeremiah	031	019	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
Jeremiah	031	020	Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often
Jeremiah	031	021	Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward
Jeremiah	031	022	How long will you go here and there, you backsliding
Jeremiah	031	023	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they
Jeremiah	031	024	Judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together,
Jeremiah	031	025	For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul
Jeremiah	031	026	On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
Jeremiah	031	027	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house
Jeremiah	031	028	It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up
Jeremiah	031	029	In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten
Jeremiah	031	030	But everyone shall die for his own iniquity:  every man who eats
Jeremiah	031	031	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new
Jeremiah	031	032	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
Jeremiah	031	033	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house
Jeremiah	031	034	and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man
Jeremiah	031	035	Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,
Jeremiah	031	036	If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	031	037	Thus says Yahweh:  If heaven above can be measured,
Jeremiah	031	038	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built
Jeremiah	031	039	The measuring line shall go out further straight onward
Jeremiah	031	040	The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes,
Jeremiah	032	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth
Jeremiah	032	002	Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem;
Jeremiah	032	003	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do
Jeremiah	032	004	and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand
Jeremiah	032	005	and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until
Jeremiah	032	006	Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Jeremiah	032	007	Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come
Jeremiah	032	008	So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard
Jeremiah	032	009	I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son,
Jeremiah	032	010	I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses,
Jeremiah	032	011	So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed,
Jeremiah	032	012	and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah,
Jeremiah	032	013	I charged Baruch before them, saying,
Jeremiah	032	014	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Take these deeds,
Jeremiah	032	015	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Houses and
Jeremiah	032	016	Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch
Jeremiah	032	017	Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, you have made the heavens and
Jeremiah	032	018	who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity
Jeremiah	032	019	great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on
Jeremiah	032	020	who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah	032	021	and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt
Jeremiah	032	022	and gave them this land, which you did swear to their fathers
Jeremiah	032	023	and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn't
Jeremiah	032	024	Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it;
Jeremiah	032	025	You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, Buy you the field for money,
Jeremiah	032	026	Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	032	027	Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh:  is there anything
Jeremiah	032	028	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will give this city into
Jeremiah	032	029	and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come
Jeremiah	032	030	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have
Jeremiah	032	031	For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of
Jeremiah	032	032	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children
Jeremiah	032	033	They have turned to me the back, and not the face:
Jeremiah	032	034	But they set their abominations in the house which is called
Jeremiah	032	035	They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
Jeremiah	032	036	Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
Jeremiah	032	037	Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries,
Jeremiah	032	038	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
Jeremiah	032	039	and I will give them one heart and one way, that they
Jeremiah	032	040	and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I
Jeremiah	032	041	Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
Jeremiah	032	042	For thus says Yahweh:  Like as I have brought all this great evil
Jeremiah	032	043	Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say,
Jeremiah	032	044	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,
Jeremiah	033	001	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time,
Jeremiah	033	002	Thus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it;
Jeremiah	033	003	Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things,
Jeremiah	033	004	For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses
Jeremiah	033	005	while [men] come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them
Jeremiah	033	006	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them;
Jeremiah	033	007	I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel
Jeremiah	033	008	I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they
Jeremiah	033	009	[This city] shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise
Jeremiah	033	010	Thus says Yahweh:  Yet again there shall be heard in this place,
Jeremiah	033	011	the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of
Jeremiah	033	012	Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Yet again shall there be in
Jeremiah	033	013	In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland,
Jeremiah	033	014	Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that
Jeremiah	033	015	In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch
Jeremiah	033	016	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely;
Jeremiah	033	017	For thus says Yahweh:  David shall never want a man to sit
Jeremiah	033	018	neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me
Jeremiah	033	019	The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	033	020	Thus says Yahweh:  If you can break my covenant of the day,
Jeremiah	033	021	then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
Jeremiah	033	022	As the army of the sky can't be numbered, neither the sand
Jeremiah	033	023	The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	033	024	Don't you consider what this people has spoken, saying, The two
Jeremiah	033	025	Thus says Yahweh:  If my covenant of day and night fails,
Jeremiah	033	026	then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David
Jeremiah	034	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar
Jeremiah	034	002	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah
Jeremiah	034	003	and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely
Jeremiah	034	004	Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah:
Jeremiah	034	005	you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers,
Jeremiah	034	006	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah
Jeremiah	034	007	when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem,
Jeremiah	034	008	The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that the king
Jeremiah	034	009	that every man should let his male servant, and every man
Jeremiah	034	010	All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered
Jeremiah	034	011	but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,
Jeremiah	034	012	Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,
Jeremiah	034	013	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel:  I made a covenant
Jeremiah	034	014	At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his
Jeremiah	034	015	You were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes,
Jeremiah	034	016	but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man
Jeremiah	034	017	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  you have not listened to me,
Jeremiah	034	018	I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant,
Jeremiah	034	019	the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs,
Jeremiah	034	020	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies,
Jeremiah	034	021	Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
Jeremiah	034	022	Behold, I will command, says Yahweh, and cause them to return
Jeremiah	035	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days
Jeremiah	035	002	Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring
Jeremiah	035	003	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah,
Jeremiah	035	004	and I brought them into the house of Yahweh, into the chamber
Jeremiah	035	005	I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls
Jeremiah	035	006	But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab,
Jeremiah	035	007	neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard,
Jeremiah	035	008	We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab,
Jeremiah	035	009	nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard,
Jeremiah	035	010	but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
Jeremiah	035	011	But it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
Jeremiah	035	012	Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	035	013	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Go, and tell
Jeremiah	035	014	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded
Jeremiah	035	015	I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets,
Jeremiah	035	016	Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
Jeremiah	035	017	therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God
Jeremiah	035	018	Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Yahweh
Jeremiah	035	019	therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Jonadab the
Jeremiah	036	001	It happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	036	002	Take a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words
Jeremiah	036	003	It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil
Jeremiah	036	004	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch
Jeremiah	036	005	Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go
Jeremiah	036	006	therefore go you, and read in the scroll, which you have written
Jeremiah	036	007	It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh,
Jeremiah	036	008	Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
Jeremiah	036	009	Now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
Jeremiah	036	010	Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
Jeremiah	036	011	When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan,
Jeremiah	036	012	he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber:
Jeremiah	036	013	Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard,
Jeremiah	036	014	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
Jeremiah	036	015	They said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
Jeremiah	036	016	Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned
Jeremiah	036	017	They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write
Jeremiah	036	018	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me
Jeremiah	036	019	Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah;
Jeremiah	036	020	They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid
Jeremiah	036	021	So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it
Jeremiah	036	022	Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month:
Jeremiah	036	023	It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves,
Jeremiah	036	024	They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king,
Jeremiah	036	025	Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
Jeremiah	036	026	The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son
Jeremiah	036	027	Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that the king
Jeremiah	036	028	Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former
Jeremiah	036	029	Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say,
Jeremiah	036	030	Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king
Jeremiah	036	031	I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity;
Jeremiah	036	032	Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch
Jeremiah	037	001	Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah
Jeremiah	037	002	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
Jeremiah	037	003	Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah
Jeremiah	037	004	Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they
Jeremiah	037	005	Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the
Jeremiah	037	006	Then came the word of Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	037	007	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Thus shall you tell
Jeremiah	037	008	The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city;
Jeremiah	037	009	Thus says Yahweh, Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans
Jeremiah	037	010	For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans
Jeremiah	037	011	It happened that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken
Jeremiah	037	012	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
Jeremiah	037	013	When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard
Jeremiah	037	014	Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to
Jeremiah	037	015	The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him,
Jeremiah	037	016	When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells,
Jeremiah	037	017	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him:
Jeremiah	037	018	Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned
Jeremiah	037	019	Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king
Jeremiah	037	020	Now please hear, my lord the king:  please let my supplication
Jeremiah	037	021	Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah
Jeremiah	038	001	Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur,
Jeremiah	038	002	Thus says Yahweh, He who remains in this city shall die
Jeremiah	038	003	Thus says Yahweh, This city shall surely be given into the hand
Jeremiah	038	004	Then the princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray you,
Jeremiah	038	005	Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand;
Jeremiah	038	006	Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
Jeremiah	038	007	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the
Jeremiah	038	008	Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke
Jeremiah	038	009	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
Jeremiah	038	010	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying,
Jeremiah	038	011	So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house
Jeremiah	038	012	Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags
Jeremiah	038	013	So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up
Jeremiah	038	014	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
Jeremiah	038	015	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you,
Jeremiah	038	016	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah	038	017	Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God
Jeremiah	038	018	But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes,
Jeremiah	038	019	Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews
Jeremiah	038	020	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you.  Obey, I beg you,
Jeremiah	038	021	But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh
Jeremiah	038	022	behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house
Jeremiah	038	023	They shall bring out all your wives and your children to
Jeremiah	038	024	Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words,
Jeremiah	038	025	But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they
Jeremiah	038	026	then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king,
Jeremiah	038	027	Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him;
Jeremiah	038	028	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day
Jeremiah	039	001	It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of
Jeremiah	039	002	in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month,
Jeremiah	039	003	that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in,
Jeremiah	039	004	It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all
Jeremiah	039	005	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook
Jeremiah	039	006	Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
Jeremiah	039	007	Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters,
Jeremiah	039	008	The Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people,
Jeremiah	039	009	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
Jeremiah	039	010	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor
Jeremiah	039	011	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
Jeremiah	039	012	Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm;
Jeremiah	039	013	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent,
Jeremiah	039	014	they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard,
Jeremiah	039	015	Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up
Jeremiah	039	016	Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says
Jeremiah	039	017	But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall
Jeremiah	039	018	For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword,
Jeremiah	040	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after that
Jeremiah	040	002	The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him,
Jeremiah	040	003	and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke:
Jeremiah	040	004	Now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are
Jeremiah	040	005	Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, [said he],
Jeremiah	040	006	Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah,
Jeremiah	040	007	Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields,
Jeremiah	040	008	then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son
Jeremiah	040	009	Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and
Jeremiah	040	010	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before
Jeremiah	040	011	Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children
Jeremiah	040	012	then all the Jews returned out of all places where they
Jeremiah	040	013	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
Jeremiah	040	014	and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children
Jeremiah	040	015	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in
Jeremiah	040	016	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son
Jeremiah	041	001	Now it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
Jeremiah	041	002	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who
Jeremiah	041	003	Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, [to wit],
Jeremiah	041	004	It happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah,
Jeremiah	041	005	that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,
Jeremiah	041	006	Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them,
Jeremiah	041	007	It was so, when they came into the midst of the city,
Jeremiah	041	008	But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don't kill us;
Jeremiah	041	009	Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies
Jeremiah	041	010	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of
Jeremiah	041	011	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
Jeremiah	041	012	then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael
Jeremiah	041	013	Now it happened that, when all the people who were with Ishmael
Jeremiah	041	014	So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive
Jeremiah	041	015	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
Jeremiah	041	016	Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
Jeremiah	041	017	and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is
Jeremiah	041	018	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them,
Jeremiah	042	001	Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah,
Jeremiah	042	002	and said to Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray you, our supplication
Jeremiah	042	003	that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk,
Jeremiah	042	004	Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you;
Jeremiah	042	005	Then they said to Jeremiah, Yahweh be a true and faithful
Jeremiah	042	006	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
Jeremiah	042	007	It happened after ten days, that the word of Yahweh
Jeremiah	042	008	Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
Jeremiah	042	009	and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
Jeremiah	042	010	If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
Jeremiah	042	011	Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid;
Jeremiah	042	012	I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you,
Jeremiah	042	013	But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you
Jeremiah	042	014	saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
Jeremiah	042	015	now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh, O remnant
Jeremiah	042	016	then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear,
Jeremiah	042	017	So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go
Jeremiah	042	018	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  As my
Jeremiah	042	019	Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don't you
Jeremiah	042	020	For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls;
Jeremiah	042	021	and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed
Jeremiah	042	022	Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword,
Jeremiah	043	001	It happened that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
Jeremiah	043	002	then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah,
Jeremiah	043	003	but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us
Jeremiah	043	004	So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
Jeremiah	043	005	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
Jeremiah	043	006	the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters,
Jeremiah	043	007	and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn't obey
Jeremiah	043	008	Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Jeremiah	043	009	Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar
Jeremiah	043	010	and tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
Jeremiah	043	011	He shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah	043	012	I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
Jeremiah	043	013	He shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in
Jeremiah	044	001	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived
Jeremiah	044	002	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  You have seen
Jeremiah	044	003	because of their wickedness which they have committed
Jeremiah	044	004	However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up
Jeremiah	044	005	But they didn't listen, nor inclined their ear to turn from
Jeremiah	044	006	Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was
Jeremiah	044	007	Therefore now thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God
Jeremiah	044	008	in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands,
Jeremiah	044	009	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers,
Jeremiah	044	010	They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared,
Jeremiah	044	011	Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God
Jeremiah	044	012	I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces
Jeremiah	044	013	For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah	044	014	so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into
Jeremiah	044	015	Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to
Jeremiah	044	016	As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh,
Jeremiah	044	017	But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth
Jeremiah	044	018	But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky,
Jeremiah	044	019	When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out
Jeremiah	044	020	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women,
Jeremiah	044	021	The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah,
Jeremiah	044	022	so that Yahweh could no longer bear, because of the evil
Jeremiah	044	023	Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned
Jeremiah	044	024	Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women,
Jeremiah	044	025	Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, You and
Jeremiah	044	026	Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in
Jeremiah	044	027	Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good;
Jeremiah	044	028	Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt
Jeremiah	044	029	This shall be the sign to you, says Yahweh, that I will punish
Jeremiah	044	030	Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king
Jeremiah	045	001	The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son
Jeremiah	045	002	Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch:
Jeremiah	045	003	You did say, Woe is me now! for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain;
Jeremiah	045	004	Thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, that which I
Jeremiah	045	005	Seek you great things for yourself?  Don't seek them;
Jeremiah	046	001	The word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet
Jeremiah	046	002	Of Egypt:  concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king
Jeremiah	046	003	Prepare you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
Jeremiah	046	004	Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth
Jeremiah	046	005	Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward;
Jeremiah	046	006	Don't let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape;
Jeremiah	046	007	Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss
Jeremiah	046	008	Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves
Jeremiah	046	009	Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men
Jeremiah	046	010	For that day is [a day] of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day
Jeremiah	046	011	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt:
Jeremiah	046	012	The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full
Jeremiah	046	013	The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet,
Jeremiah	046	014	Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis
Jeremiah	046	015	Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn't stand,
Jeremiah	046	016	He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another:
Jeremiah	046	017	They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;
Jeremiah	046	018	As I live, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies,
Jeremiah	046	019	You daughter who dwell in Egypt, furnish yourself to go
Jeremiah	046	020	Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; [but] destruction out of
Jeremiah	046	021	Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall;
Jeremiah	046	022	The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march
Jeremiah	046	023	They shall cut down her forest, says Yahweh, though it
Jeremiah	046	024	The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be
Jeremiah	046	025	Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:  Behold, I will
Jeremiah	046	026	and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives,
Jeremiah	046	027	But don't be afraid you, Jacob my servant, neither be
Jeremiah	046	028	Don't be afraid you, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I
Jeremiah	047	001	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning
Jeremiah	047	002	Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
Jeremiah	047	003	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,
Jeremiah	047	004	because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,
Jeremiah	047	005	Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing,
Jeremiah	047	006	You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet?
Jeremiah	047	007	How can you be quiet, seeing Yahweh has given you a charge?
Jeremiah	048	001	Of Moab.  Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Woe to
Jeremiah	048	002	The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised
Jeremiah	048	003	The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!
Jeremiah	048	004	Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
Jeremiah	048	005	For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up;
Jeremiah	048	006	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
Jeremiah	048	007	For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
Jeremiah	048	008	The destroyer shall come on every city, and no city shall escape;
Jeremiah	048	009	Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get her away:
Jeremiah	048	010	Cursed be he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;
Jeremiah	048	011	Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled
Jeremiah	048	012	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will send
Jeremiah	048	013	Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
Jeremiah	048	014	How say you, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?
Jeremiah	048	015	Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities,
Jeremiah	048	016	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction
Jeremiah	048	017	All you who are round about him, bemoan him, and all you
Jeremiah	048	018	You daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory,
Jeremiah	048	019	Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch:
Jeremiah	048	020	Moab is disappointed; for it is broken down:  wail and cry;
Jeremiah	048	021	Judgment is come on the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah,
Jeremiah	048	022	and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth Diblathaim,
Jeremiah	048	023	and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,
Jeremiah	048	024	and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land
Jeremiah	048	025	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Yahweh.
Jeremiah	048	026	Make you him drunken; for he magnified himself against Yahweh:
Jeremiah	048	027	For wasn't Israel a derision to you? was he found among thieves?
Jeremiah	048	028	You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock;
Jeremiah	048	029	We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud;
Jeremiah	048	030	I know his wrath, says Yahweh, that it is nothing; his boastings
Jeremiah	048	031	Therefore will I wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab:
Jeremiah	048	032	With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you,
Jeremiah	048	033	Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field
Jeremiah	048	034	From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz
Jeremiah	048	035	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	048	036	Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my
Jeremiah	048	037	For every head is bald, and every beard clipped:
Jeremiah	048	038	On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets of it there is
Jeremiah	048	039	How is it broken down! [how] do they wail! how has Moab
Jeremiah	048	040	For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,
Jeremiah	048	041	Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart
Jeremiah	048	042	Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has
Jeremiah	048	043	Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant
Jeremiah	048	044	He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit;
Jeremiah	048	045	Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;
Jeremiah	048	046	Woe to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons
Jeremiah	048	047	Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
Jeremiah	049	001	Of the children of Ammon.  Thus says Yahweh:  Has Israel
Jeremiah	049	002	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause
Jeremiah	049	003	Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah,
Jeremiah	049	004	Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding
Jeremiah	049	005	Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
Jeremiah	049	006	But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children
Jeremiah	049	007	Of Edom.  Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Is wisdom no more in Teman?
Jeremiah	049	008	Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;
Jeremiah	049	009	If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some
Jeremiah	049	010	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
Jeremiah	049	011	Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive;
Jeremiah	049	012	For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain
Jeremiah	049	013	For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall
Jeremiah	049	014	I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent
Jeremiah	049	015	For, behold, I have made you small among the nations,
Jeremiah	049	016	As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you,
Jeremiah	049	017	Edom shall become an astonishment:  everyone who passes by it
Jeremiah	049	018	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor
Jeremiah	049	019	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan
Jeremiah	049	020	Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken
Jeremiah	049	021	The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry,
Jeremiah	049	022	Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread
Jeremiah	049	023	Of Damascus.  Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard
Jeremiah	049	024	Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee,
Jeremiah	049	025	How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
Jeremiah	049	026	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all
Jeremiah	049	027	I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
Jeremiah	049	028	Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar
Jeremiah	049	029	Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry
Jeremiah	049	030	Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants
Jeremiah	049	031	Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells
Jeremiah	049	032	Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
Jeremiah	049	033	Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever:
Jeremiah	049	034	The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam,
Jeremiah	049	035	Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,
Jeremiah	049	036	On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters
Jeremiah	049	037	I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
Jeremiah	049	038	and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there
Jeremiah	049	039	But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back
Jeremiah	050	001	The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land
Jeremiah	050	002	Declare you among the nations and publish, and set up
Jeremiah	050	003	For out of the north there comes up a nation against her,
Jeremiah	050	004	In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children
Jeremiah	050	005	They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned
Jeremiah	050	006	My people have been lost sheep:  their shepherds have caused
Jeremiah	050	007	All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said,
Jeremiah	050	008	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
Jeremiah	050	009	For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon
Jeremiah	050	010	Chaldea shall be a prey:  all who prey on her shall
Jeremiah	050	011	Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder
Jeremiah	050	012	your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall
Jeremiah	050	013	Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited,
Jeremiah	050	014	Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about,
Jeremiah	050	015	Shout against her round about:  she has submitted herself;
Jeremiah	050	016	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle
Jeremiah	050	017	Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away:
Jeremiah	050	018	Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I
Jeremiah	050	019	I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed
Jeremiah	050	020	In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity
Jeremiah	050	021	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against
Jeremiah	050	022	A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
Jeremiah	050	023	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken!
Jeremiah	050	024	I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon,
Jeremiah	050	025	Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons
Jeremiah	050	026	Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses;
Jeremiah	050	027	Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter:
Jeremiah	050	028	The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land
Jeremiah	050	029	Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend
Jeremiah	050	030	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men
Jeremiah	050	031	Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh
Jeremiah	050	032	The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up;
Jeremiah	050	033	Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The children of Israel and the
Jeremiah	050	034	Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name:
Jeremiah	050	035	A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants
Jeremiah	050	036	A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools;
Jeremiah	050	037	A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots,
Jeremiah	050	038	A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up;
Jeremiah	050	039	Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves
Jeremiah	050	040	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor
Jeremiah	050	041	Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation
Jeremiah	050	042	They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;
Jeremiah	050	043	The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands
Jeremiah	050	044	Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from
Jeremiah	050	045	Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken
Jeremiah	050	046	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles,
Jeremiah	051	001	Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
Jeremiah	051	002	I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow her;
Jeremiah	051	003	Against [him who] bends let the archer bend his bow,
Jeremiah	051	004	They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
Jeremiah	051	005	For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh
Jeremiah	051	006	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life;
Jeremiah	051	007	Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh's hand, who made
Jeremiah	051	008	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:  wail for her;
Jeremiah	051	009	We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed:
Jeremiah	051	010	Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness:  come, and let us
Jeremiah	051	011	Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields:
Jeremiah	051	012	Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the
Jeremiah	051	013	You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end
Jeremiah	051	014	Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I
Jeremiah	051	015	He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world
Jeremiah	051	016	when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
Jeremiah	051	017	Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;
Jeremiah	051	018	They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their
Jeremiah	051	019	The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former
Jeremiah	051	020	You are my battle axe and weapons of war:  and with you will I
Jeremiah	051	021	and with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
Jeremiah	051	022	and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and him who
Jeremiah	051	023	and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;
Jeremiah	051	024	I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea
Jeremiah	051	025	Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain, says Yahweh,
Jeremiah	051	026	They shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone
Jeremiah	051	027	Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among
Jeremiah	051	028	Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes,
Jeremiah	051	029	The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh
Jeremiah	051	030	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight,
Jeremiah	051	031	One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger
Jeremiah	051	032	and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned
Jeremiah	051	033	For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  The daughter
Jeremiah	051	034	Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has
Jeremiah	051	035	The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon,
Jeremiah	051	036	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will plead your cause,
Jeremiah	051	037	Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals,
Jeremiah	051	038	They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl
Jeremiah	051	039	When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make
Jeremiah	051	040	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
Jeremiah	051	041	How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized!
Jeremiah	051	042	The sea is come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude
Jeremiah	051	043	Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert,
Jeremiah	051	044	I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring
Jeremiah	051	045	My people, go you out of the midst of her, and save yourselves
Jeremiah	051	046	Don't let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that
Jeremiah	051	047	Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment
Jeremiah	051	048	Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein,
Jeremiah	051	049	As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon
Jeremiah	051	050	You who have escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still;
Jeremiah	051	051	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has
Jeremiah	051	052	Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will
Jeremiah	051	053	Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she
Jeremiah	051	054	The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction
Jeremiah	051	055	For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her
Jeremiah	051	056	for the destroyer is come on her, even on Babylon, and her
Jeremiah	051	057	I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors
Jeremiah	051	058	Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The broad walls of Babylon
Jeremiah	051	059	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son
Jeremiah	051	060	Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon,
Jeremiah	051	061	Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see
Jeremiah	051	062	and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut
Jeremiah	051	063	It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book,
Jeremiah	051	064	and you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
Jeremiah	052	001	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;
Jeremiah	052	002	He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to
Jeremiah	052	003	For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem
Jeremiah	052	004	It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
Jeremiah	052	005	So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
Jeremiah	052	006	In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine
Jeremiah	052	007	Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled,
Jeremiah	052	008	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king,
Jeremiah	052	009	Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king
Jeremiah	052	010	The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:
Jeremiah	052	011	He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
Jeremiah	052	012	Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month,
Jeremiah	052	013	and he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king's house;
Jeremiah	052	014	All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of
Jeremiah	052	015	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
Jeremiah	052	016	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest
Jeremiah	052	017	The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh,
Jeremiah	052	018	The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins,
Jeremiah	052	019	The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots,
Jeremiah	052	020	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls
Jeremiah	052	021	As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was
Jeremiah	052	022	A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital
Jeremiah	052	023	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the
Jeremiah	052	024	The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
Jeremiah	052	025	and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men
Jeremiah	052	026	Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
Jeremiah	052	027	The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah
Jeremiah	052	028	This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:
Jeremiah	052	029	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away
Jeremiah	052	030	in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan
Jeremiah	052	031	It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
Jeremiah	052	032	and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne
Jeremiah	052	033	and changed his prison garments.  [Jehoiachin] ate bread
Jeremiah	052	034	and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given
Lamentations	001	001	How the city sits solitary, that was full of people!
Lamentations	001	002	She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks;
Lamentations	001	003	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of
Lamentations	001	004	The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly;
Lamentations	001	005	Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; for Yahweh
Lamentations	001	006	From the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:
Lamentations	001	007	Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her
Lamentations	001	008	Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is become
Lamentations	001	009	Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn't remember her latter end;
Lamentations	001	010	The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things:
Lamentations	001	011	All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant
Lamentations	001	012	Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?  Look, and see
Lamentations	001	013	From on high has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails
Lamentations	001	014	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;
Lamentations	001	015	The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me;
Lamentations	001	016	For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water;
Lamentations	001	017	Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;
Lamentations	001	018	Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
Lamentations	001	019	I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me:
Lamentations	001	020	See, Yahweh; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;
Lamentations	001	021	They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me;
Lamentations	001	022	Let all their wickedness come before you; Do to them,
Lamentations	002	001	How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud
Lamentations	002	002	The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has
Lamentations	002	003	He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He has
Lamentations	002	004	He has bent his bow like an enemy, he has stood with his right hand
Lamentations	002	005	The Lord is become as an enemy, he has swallowed up Israel; He has
Lamentations	002	006	He has violently taken away his tent, as if it were of a garden;
Lamentations	002	007	The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary;
Lamentations	002	008	Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter
Lamentations	002	009	Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken
Lamentations	002	010	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground,
Lamentations	002	011	My eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled; My liver is
Lamentations	002	012	They tell their mothers, Where is grain and wine?
Lamentations	002	013	What shall I testify to you? what shall I liken to you,
Lamentations	002	014	Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions;
Lamentations	002	015	All that pass by clap their hands at you; They hiss and wag
Lamentations	002	016	All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you;
Lamentations	002	017	Yahweh has done that which he purposed; he has fulfilled his
Lamentations	002	018	Their heart cried to the Lord:  wall of the daughter of Zion,
Lamentations	002	019	Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;
Lamentations	002	020	Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!  Shall the women
Lamentations	002	021	The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;
Lamentations	002	022	You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors
Lamentations	003	001	I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
Lamentations	003	002	He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
Lamentations	003	003	Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.
Lamentations	003	004	My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.
Lamentations	003	005	He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
Lamentations	003	006	He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have
Lamentations	003	007	He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made
Lamentations	003	008	Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.
Lamentations	003	009	He has walled up my ways with hewn stone; he has made
Lamentations	003	010	He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
Lamentations	003	011	He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces;
Lamentations	003	012	He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
Lamentations	003	013	He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
Lamentations	003	014	I am become a derision to all my people, and their song
Lamentations	003	015	He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.
Lamentations	003	016	He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered
Lamentations	003	017	You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.
Lamentations	003	018	I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.
Lamentations	003	019	Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
Lamentations	003	020	My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.
Lamentations	003	021	This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.
Lamentations	003	022	[It is of] Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,
Lamentations	003	023	They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
Lamentations	003	024	Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
Lamentations	003	025	Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul
Lamentations	003	026	It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the
Lamentations	003	027	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
Lamentations	003	028	Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid
Lamentations	003	029	Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
Lamentations	003	030	Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled
Lamentations	003	031	For the Lord will not cast off forever.
Lamentations	003	032	For though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion according
Lamentations	003	033	For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
Lamentations	003	034	To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
Lamentations	003	035	To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
Lamentations	003	036	To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn't approve.
Lamentations	003	037	Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord
Lamentations	003	038	Doesn't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?
Lamentations	003	039	Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment
Lamentations	003	040	Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.
Lamentations	003	041	Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.
Lamentations	003	042	We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.
Lamentations	003	043	You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed,
Lamentations	003	044	You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer
Lamentations	003	045	You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst
Lamentations	003	046	All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
Lamentations	003	047	Fear and the pit are come on us, devastation and destruction.
Lamentations	003	048	My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction
Lamentations	003	049	My eye pours down, and doesn't cease, without any intermission,
Lamentations	003	050	Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven.
Lamentations	003	051	My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations	003	052	They have chased me sore like a bird, those who are my
Lamentations	003	053	They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast
Lamentations	003	054	Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
Lamentations	003	055	I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.
Lamentations	003	056	You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing,
Lamentations	003	057	You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said,
Lamentations	003	058	Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have
Lamentations	003	059	Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge you my cause.
Lamentations	003	060	You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
Lamentations	003	061	You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their
Lamentations	003	062	The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
Lamentations	003	063	See you their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
Lamentations	003	064	You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to
Lamentations	003	065	You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.

Lamentations	004	006	For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater
Lamentations	004	007	Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;

Lamentations	004	015	Depart you, they cried to them, Unclean! depart, depart, don't touch!
Lamentations	004	016	The anger of Yahweh has scattered them; he will no more regard them:
Lamentations	004	017	Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help:
Lamentations	004	018	They hunt our steps, so that we can't go in our streets:
Lamentations	004	019	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky:
Lamentations	004	020	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken
Lamentations	004	021	Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land
Lamentations	004	022	The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion;

Ezekiel	001	001	Now it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month],
Ezekiel	001	002	In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year
Ezekiel	001	003	the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son
Ezekiel	001	004	I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north,
Ezekiel	001	005	Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures.
Ezekiel	001	006	Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
Ezekiel	001	007	Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet
Ezekiel	001	008	They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides;
Ezekiel	001	009	their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn
Ezekiel	001	010	As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man;
Ezekiel	001	011	Their faces and their wings were separate above;
Ezekiel	001	012	Each one went straight forward:  where the spirit was to go,
Ezekiel	001	013	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
Ezekiel	001	014	The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance
Ezekiel	001	015	Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on
Ezekiel	001	016	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl:
Ezekiel	001	017	When they went, they went in their four directions:
Ezekiel	001	018	As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four
Ezekiel	001	019	When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them;
Ezekiel	001	020	Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go:
Ezekiel	001	021	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
Ezekiel	001	022	Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness
Ezekiel	001	023	Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward
Ezekiel	001	024	When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise
Ezekiel	001	025	There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads:
Ezekiel	001	026	Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of
Ezekiel	001	027	I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within
Ezekiel	001	028	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
Ezekiel	002	001	He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will
Ezekiel	002	002	The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me
Ezekiel	002	003	He said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel,
Ezekiel	002	004	The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you
Ezekiel	002	005	They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
Ezekiel	002	006	You, son of man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid
Ezekiel	002	007	You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear,
Ezekiel	002	008	But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; don't be you
Ezekiel	002	009	When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, behold,
Ezekiel	002	010	He spread it before me:  and it was written within and without;
Ezekiel	003	001	He said to me, Son of man, eat that which you find;
Ezekiel	003	002	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.
Ezekiel	003	003	He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat,
Ezekiel	003	004	He said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	003	005	For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of
Ezekiel	003	006	not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language,
Ezekiel	003	007	But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will
Ezekiel	003	008	Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces,
Ezekiel	003	009	As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead:
Ezekiel	003	010	Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
Ezekiel	003	011	Go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people,
Ezekiel	003	012	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice
Ezekiel	003	013	[I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they
Ezekiel	003	014	So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went
Ezekiel	003	015	Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived
Ezekiel	003	016	It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh
Ezekiel	003	017	Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel:
Ezekiel	003	018	When I tell the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him
Ezekiel	003	019	Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn't turn from his wickedness,
Ezekiel	003	020	Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness,
Ezekiel	003	021	Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous
Ezekiel	003	022	The hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise,
Ezekiel	003	023	Then I arose, and went forth into the plain:  and behold,
Ezekiel	003	024	Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet;
Ezekiel	003	025	But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you,
Ezekiel	003	026	and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth,
Ezekiel	003	027	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you
Ezekiel	004	001	You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before you,
Ezekiel	004	002	and lay siege against it, and build forts against it,
Ezekiel	004	003	Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron
Ezekiel	004	004	Moreover lie you on your left side, and lay the iniquity of
Ezekiel	004	005	For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be
Ezekiel	004	006	Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your
Ezekiel	004	007	You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
Ezekiel	004	008	Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from
Ezekiel	004	009	Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils,
Ezekiel	004	010	Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels
Ezekiel	004	011	You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin:
Ezekiel	004	012	You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it
Ezekiel	004	013	Yahweh said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their
Ezekiel	004	014	Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, my soul has not been polluted;
Ezekiel	004	015	Then he said to me, Behold, I have given you cow's dung
Ezekiel	004	016	Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff
Ezekiel	004	017	that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another,
Ezekiel	005	001	You, son of man, take a sharp sword; [as] a barber's razor
Ezekiel	005	002	A third part shall you burn in the fire in the midst of the city,
Ezekiel	005	003	You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.
Ezekiel	005	004	Of these again shall you take, and cast them into the midst
Ezekiel	005	005	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This is Jerusalem; I have set her
Ezekiel	005	006	She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more
Ezekiel	005	007	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are turbulent
Ezekiel	005	008	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I, even I,
Ezekiel	005	009	I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I
Ezekiel	005	010	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you,
Ezekiel	005	011	Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely, because you
Ezekiel	005	012	A third part of you shall die with the pestilence,
Ezekiel	005	013	Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause
Ezekiel	005	014	Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among
Ezekiel	005	015	So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and
Ezekiel	005	016	when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine,
Ezekiel	005	017	and I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they shall
Ezekiel	006	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	006	002	Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel,
Ezekiel	006	003	and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
Ezekiel	006	004	Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars
Ezekiel	006	005	I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel
Ezekiel	006	006	In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste,
Ezekiel	006	007	The slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know
Ezekiel	006	008	Yet will I leave a remnant, in that you shall have some that
Ezekiel	006	009	Those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations
Ezekiel	006	010	They shall know that I am Yahweh:  I have not said in vain
Ezekiel	006	011	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Smite with your hand, and stamp with
Ezekiel	006	012	He who is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he who is
Ezekiel	006	013	You shall know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men shall be
Ezekiel	006	014	I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate
Ezekiel	007	001	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	007	002	You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land
Ezekiel	007	003	Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you,
Ezekiel	007	004	My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity;
Ezekiel	007	005	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  An evil, an only evil; behold, it comes.
Ezekiel	007	006	An end is come, the end is come; it awakes against you;
Ezekiel	007	007	Your doom is come to you, inhabitant of the land:
Ezekiel	007	008	Now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my
Ezekiel	007	009	My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity:
Ezekiel	007	010	Behold, the day, behold, it comes:  your doom is gone forth;
Ezekiel	007	011	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them
Ezekiel	007	012	The time is come, the day draws near:  don't let the buyer rejoice,
Ezekiel	007	013	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
Ezekiel	007	014	They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none
Ezekiel	007	015	The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within:
Ezekiel	007	016	But those of those who escape shall escape, and shall be on
Ezekiel	007	017	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel	007	018	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
Ezekiel	007	019	They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
Ezekiel	007	020	As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty;
Ezekiel	007	021	I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
Ezekiel	007	022	My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane
Ezekiel	007	023	Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes,
Ezekiel	007	024	Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall
Ezekiel	007	025	Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there
Ezekiel	007	026	Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor;
Ezekiel	007	027	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation,
Ezekiel	008	001	It happened in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth
Ezekiel	008	002	Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire;
Ezekiel	008	003	He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head;
Ezekiel	008	004	Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to
Ezekiel	008	005	Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way
Ezekiel	008	006	He said to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great
Ezekiel	008	007	He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
Ezekiel	008	008	Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall:
Ezekiel	008	009	He said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that
Ezekiel	008	010	So I went in and saw; and see, every form of creeping things,
Ezekiel	008	011	There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house
Ezekiel	008	012	Then said he to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders
Ezekiel	008	013	He said also to me, You shall again see yet other great
Ezekiel	008	014	Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh's house
Ezekiel	008	015	Then said he to me, Have you seen [this], son of man? you
Ezekiel	008	016	He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh's house; and see,
Ezekiel	008	017	Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], son of man?
Ezekiel	008	018	Therefore will I also deal in wrath; my eye shall not spare,
Ezekiel	009	001	Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause you
Ezekiel	009	002	Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate,
Ezekiel	009	003	The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
Ezekiel	009	004	Yahweh said to him, Go through the midst of the city,
Ezekiel	009	005	To the others he said in my hearing, Go you through
Ezekiel	009	006	kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin,
Ezekiel	009	007	He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
Ezekiel	009	008	It happened, while they were smiting, and I was left,
Ezekiel	009	009	Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
Ezekiel	009	010	As for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity,
Ezekiel	009	011	Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by
Ezekiel	010	001	Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head
Ezekiel	010	002	He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between
Ezekiel	010	003	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house,
Ezekiel	010	004	The glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub, [and stood]
Ezekiel	010	005	The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to
Ezekiel	010	006	It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen,
Ezekiel	010	007	The cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim
Ezekiel	010	008	There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand
Ezekiel	010	009	I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel
Ezekiel	010	010	As for their appearance, they four had one likeness,
Ezekiel	010	011	When they went, they went in their four directions:
Ezekiel	010	012	Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands,
Ezekiel	010	013	As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing,
Ezekiel	010	014	Every one had four faces:  the first face was the face
Ezekiel	010	015	The cherubim mounted up:  this is the living creature that I
Ezekiel	010	016	When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when
Ezekiel	010	017	When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up,
Ezekiel	010	018	The glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house,
Ezekiel	010	019	The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth
Ezekiel	010	020	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
Ezekiel	010	021	Every one had four faces, and every one four wings;
Ezekiel	010	022	As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I
Ezekiel	011	001	Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to
Ezekiel	011	002	He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity,
Ezekiel	011	003	who say, [The time] is not near to build houses:
Ezekiel	011	004	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.
Ezekiel	011	005	The Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me,
Ezekiel	011	006	You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled
Ezekiel	011	007	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Your slain whom you
Ezekiel	011	008	You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,
Ezekiel	011	009	I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you
Ezekiel	011	010	You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border
Ezekiel	011	011	This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh
Ezekiel	011	012	and you shall know that I am Yahweh:  for you have not walked
Ezekiel	011	013	It happened, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
Ezekiel	011	014	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	011	015	Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men
Ezekiel	011	016	Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Whereas I have removed
Ezekiel	011	017	Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will gather you
Ezekiel	011	018	They shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable
Ezekiel	011	019	I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you;
Ezekiel	011	020	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances,
Ezekiel	011	021	But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their
Ezekiel	011	022	Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels
Ezekiel	011	023	The glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city,
Ezekiel	011	024	The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by
Ezekiel	011	025	Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh
Ezekiel	012	001	The word of Yahweh also came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	012	002	Son of man, you dwell in the midst of the rebellious house,
Ezekiel	012	003	Therefore, you son of man, prepare you stuff for removing,
Ezekiel	012	004	You shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight,
Ezekiel	012	005	Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
Ezekiel	012	006	In their sight shall you bear it on your shoulder,
Ezekiel	012	007	I did so as I was commanded:  I brought forth my stuff by day,
Ezekiel	012	008	In the morning came the word of Yahweh to me, saying,
Ezekiel	012	009	Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
Ezekiel	012	010	Say you to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This burden
Ezekiel	012	011	Say, I am your sign:  like as I have done, so shall it be done
Ezekiel	012	012	The prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder
Ezekiel	012	013	My net also will I spread on him, and he shall be taken in my snare;
Ezekiel	012	014	I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about
Ezekiel	012	015	They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall disperse them
Ezekiel	012	016	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword,
Ezekiel	012	017	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	012	018	Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water
Ezekiel	012	019	and tell the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Yahweh
Ezekiel	012	020	The cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land
Ezekiel	012	021	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	012	022	Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land
Ezekiel	012	023	Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will
Ezekiel	012	024	For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering
Ezekiel	012	025	For I am Yahweh; I will speak, and the word that I shall
Ezekiel	012	026	Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	012	027	Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
Ezekiel	012	028	Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  There shall
Ezekiel	013	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	013	002	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy,
Ezekiel	013	003	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Woe to the foolish prophets,
Ezekiel	013	004	Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
Ezekiel	013	005	You have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up
Ezekiel	013	006	They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say,
Ezekiel	013	007	Haven't you seen a false vision, and haven't you spoken
Ezekiel	013	008	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have spoken
Ezekiel	013	009	My hand shall be against the prophets who see false visions,
Ezekiel	013	010	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace;
Ezekiel	013	011	tell those who daub it with whitewash, that it shall fall:
Ezekiel	013	012	Behold, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to you,
Ezekiel	013	013	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will even tear it with
Ezekiel	013	014	So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash,
Ezekiel	013	015	Thus will I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those
Ezekiel	013	016	[to wit], the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem,
Ezekiel	013	017	You, son of man, set your face against the daughters
Ezekiel	013	018	and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the women who sew
Ezekiel	013	019	You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley
Ezekiel	013	020	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am
Ezekiel	013	021	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
Ezekiel	013	022	Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous,
Ezekiel	013	023	Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor
Ezekiel	014	001	Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me.
Ezekiel	014	002	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	014	003	Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart,
Ezekiel	014	004	Therefore speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the
Ezekiel	014	005	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
Ezekiel	014	006	Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the
Ezekiel	014	007	For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who
Ezekiel	014	008	and I will set my face against that man, and will make him
Ezekiel	014	009	If the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Yahweh, have
Ezekiel	014	010	They shall bear their iniquity:  the iniquity of the prophet
Ezekiel	014	011	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
Ezekiel	014	012	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	014	013	Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass,
Ezekiel	014	014	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
Ezekiel	014	015	If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they
Ezekiel	014	016	though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh,
Ezekiel	014	017	Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through
Ezekiel	014	018	though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh,
Ezekiel	014	019	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath
Ezekiel	014	020	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, says the
Ezekiel	014	021	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  How much more when I send my
Ezekiel	014	022	Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
Ezekiel	014	023	They shall comfort you, when you see their way and their doings;
Ezekiel	015	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	015	002	Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree,
Ezekiel	015	003	Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? or will men take
Ezekiel	015	004	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has
Ezekiel	015	005	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work:
Ezekiel	015	006	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As the vine tree among
Ezekiel	015	007	I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire,
Ezekiel	015	008	I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
Ezekiel	016	001	Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	016	002	Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;
Ezekiel	016	003	and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem:  Your birth
Ezekiel	016	004	As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was
Ezekiel	016	005	No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have
Ezekiel	016	006	When I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your blood,
Ezekiel	016	007	I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you
Ezekiel	016	008	Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time
Ezekiel	016	009	Then washed I you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away
Ezekiel	016	010	I clothed you also with embroidered work, and shod you
Ezekiel	016	011	I decked you with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands,
Ezekiel	016	012	I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears,
Ezekiel	016	013	Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your clothing
Ezekiel	016	014	Your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty;
Ezekiel	016	015	But you did trust in your beauty, and played the prostitute
Ezekiel	016	016	You took of your garments, and made for yourselves high places
Ezekiel	016	017	You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver,
Ezekiel	016	018	and you took your embroidered garments, and covered them,
Ezekiel	016	019	My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
Ezekiel	016	020	Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have
Ezekiel	016	021	that you have slain my children, and delivered them up,
Ezekiel	016	022	In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not
Ezekiel	016	023	It is happen after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you! says
Ezekiel	016	024	that you have built to you a vaulted place, and have made you
Ezekiel	016	025	You have built your lofty place at the head of every way,
Ezekiel	016	026	You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians,
Ezekiel	016	027	See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have
Ezekiel	016	028	You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians,
Ezekiel	016	029	You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land
Ezekiel	016	030	How weak is your heart, says the Lord Yahweh, seeing you
Ezekiel	016	031	in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way,
Ezekiel	016	032	A wife who commits adultery! who takes strangers instead
Ezekiel	016	033	They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts
Ezekiel	016	034	You are different from [other] women in your prostitution,
Ezekiel	016	035	Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh:
Ezekiel	016	036	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Because your filthiness was poured out,
Ezekiel	016	037	therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you
Ezekiel	016	038	I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood
Ezekiel	016	039	I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw
Ezekiel	016	040	They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall
Ezekiel	016	041	They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments
Ezekiel	016	042	So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy
Ezekiel	016	043	Because you have not remembered the days of your youth,
Ezekiel	016	044	Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use [this] proverb
Ezekiel	016	045	You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband
Ezekiel	016	046	Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand,
Ezekiel	016	047	Yet have you not walked in their ways, nor done after
Ezekiel	016	048	As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, Sodom your sister has not done,
Ezekiel	016	049	Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom:
Ezekiel	016	050	They were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
Ezekiel	016	051	Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have
Ezekiel	016	052	You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment
Ezekiel	016	053	I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and
Ezekiel	016	054	that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because
Ezekiel	016	055	Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
Ezekiel	016	056	For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day
Ezekiel	016	057	before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the
Ezekiel	016	058	You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says Yahweh.
Ezekiel	016	059	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also deal with you as you
Ezekiel	016	060	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days
Ezekiel	016	061	Then shall you remember your ways, and be ashamed,
Ezekiel	016	062	I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know
Ezekiel	016	063	that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your
Ezekiel	017	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	017	002	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the
Ezekiel	017	003	and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  A great eagle with great wings
Ezekiel	017	004	he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried
Ezekiel	017	005	He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it
Ezekiel	017	006	It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches
Ezekiel	017	007	There was also another great eagle with great wings
Ezekiel	017	008	It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it
Ezekiel	017	009	Say you, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Shall it prosper? shall
Ezekiel	017	010	Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
Ezekiel	017	011	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	017	012	Say now to the rebellious house, Don't you know what these things
Ezekiel	017	013	and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him;
Ezekiel	017	014	that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up,
Ezekiel	017	015	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors
Ezekiel	017	016	As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely in the place where
Ezekiel	017	017	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
Ezekiel	017	018	For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold,
Ezekiel	017	019	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As I live, surely my oath
Ezekiel	017	020	I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare,
Ezekiel	017	021	All his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword,
Ezekiel	017	022	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also take of the lofty top
Ezekiel	017	023	in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it
Ezekiel	017	024	All the trees of the field shall know that I, Yahweh, have brought
Ezekiel	018	001	The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,
Ezekiel	018	002	What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land
Ezekiel	018	003	As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, you shall not have [occasion]
Ezekiel	018	004	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father,
Ezekiel	018	005	But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,
Ezekiel	018	006	and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up
Ezekiel	018	007	and has not wronged any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge,
Ezekiel	018	008	he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken
Ezekiel	018	009	has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly;
Ezekiel	018	010	If he fathers a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood,
Ezekiel	018	011	and who does not any of those [duties], but even has eaten
Ezekiel	018	012	has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not
Ezekiel	018	013	has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; shall he then
Ezekiel	018	014	Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father's sins,
Ezekiel	018	015	who has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up
Ezekiel	018	016	neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge,
Ezekiel	018	017	who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who has not received
Ezekiel	018	018	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother,
Ezekiel	018	019	Yet say you, Why does not the son bear the iniquity
Ezekiel	018	020	The soul who sins, he shall die:  the son shall not bear
Ezekiel	018	021	But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed,
Ezekiel	018	022	None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be
Ezekiel	018	023	Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Yahweh;
Ezekiel	018	024	But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness,
Ezekiel	018	025	Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.
Ezekiel	018	026	When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness,
Ezekiel	018	027	Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness
Ezekiel	018	028	Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions
Ezekiel	018	029	Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal.
Ezekiel	018	030	Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel,
Ezekiel	018	031	Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you
Ezekiel	018	032	For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,
Ezekiel	019	001	Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
Ezekiel	019	002	and say, What was your mother?  A lioness:  she couched among lions,
Ezekiel	019	003	She brought up one of her cubs:  he became a young lion,
Ezekiel	019	004	The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit;
Ezekiel	019	005	Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost,
Ezekiel	019	006	He went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion,
Ezekiel	019	007	He knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land
Ezekiel	019	008	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces;
Ezekiel	019	009	They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king
Ezekiel	019	010	Your mother was like a vine, in your blood, planted by the waters:
Ezekiel	019	011	It had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule,
Ezekiel	019	012	But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground,
Ezekiel	019	013	Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
Ezekiel	019	014	Fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it has devoured
Ezekiel	020	001	It happened in the seventh year, in the fifth [month],
Ezekiel	020	002	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	020	003	Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, Thus says
Ezekiel	020	004	Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them?
Ezekiel	020	005	and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day when I
Ezekiel	020	006	in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land
Ezekiel	020	007	I said to them, Cast you away every man the abominations
Ezekiel	020	008	But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me;
Ezekiel	020	009	But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be
Ezekiel	020	010	So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
Ezekiel	020	011	I gave them my statutes, and shown them my ordinances,
Ezekiel	020	012	Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign
Ezekiel	020	013	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
Ezekiel	020	014	But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned
Ezekiel	020	015	Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I
Ezekiel	020	016	because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in
Ezekiel	020	017	Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn't destroy them,
Ezekiel	020	018	I said to their children in the wilderness, Don't you walk in
Ezekiel	020	019	I am Yahweh your God:  walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances,
Ezekiel	020	020	and make my Sabbaths holy; and they shall be a sign between me
Ezekiel	020	021	But the children rebelled against me; they didn't walk in
Ezekiel	020	022	Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake,
Ezekiel	020	023	Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter
Ezekiel	020	024	because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected
Ezekiel	020	025	Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good,
Ezekiel	020	026	and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused
Ezekiel	020	027	Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	020	028	For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore
Ezekiel	020	029	Then I said to them, What means the high place whereunto you go?
Ezekiel	020	030	Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Do you
Ezekiel	020	031	and when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons
Ezekiel	020	032	and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all,
Ezekiel	020	033	As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely with a mighty hand,
Ezekiel	020	034	and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out
Ezekiel	020	035	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples,
Ezekiel	020	036	Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness
Ezekiel	020	037	I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
Ezekiel	020	038	and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who
Ezekiel	020	039	As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Go you,
Ezekiel	020	040	For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,
Ezekiel	020	041	As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from
Ezekiel	020	042	You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall bring you into
Ezekiel	020	043	There shall you remember your ways, and all your doings,
Ezekiel	020	044	You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you
Ezekiel	020	045	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	020	046	Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop [your
Ezekiel	020	047	and tell the forest of the South, Hear the word of Yahweh:  Thus says
Ezekiel	020	048	All flesh shall see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it;
Ezekiel	020	049	Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! they say of me, Isn't he a
Ezekiel	021	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	021	002	Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop [your word]
Ezekiel	021	003	and tell the land of Israel, Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I am
Ezekiel	021	004	Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and
Ezekiel	021	005	and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, have drawn forth
Ezekiel	021	006	Sigh therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your thighs
Ezekiel	021	007	It shall be, when they tell you, Why do you sigh? that you shall say,
Ezekiel	021	008	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	021	009	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh:  Say, A sword,
Ezekiel	021	010	it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished
Ezekiel	021	011	It is given to be furbished, that it may be handled:
Ezekiel	021	012	Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people, it is on all
Ezekiel	021	013	For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that condemns
Ezekiel	021	014	You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together;
Ezekiel	021	015	I have set the threatening sword against all their gates,
Ezekiel	021	016	Gather you together, go to the right, set yourself in array,
Ezekiel	021	017	I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath
Ezekiel	021	018	The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,
Ezekiel	021	019	Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king
Ezekiel	021	020	You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of
Ezekiel	021	021	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way,
Ezekiel	021	022	In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem,
Ezekiel	021	023	It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight,
Ezekiel	021	024	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have made
Ezekiel	021	025	You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel,
Ezekiel	021	026	thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Remove the turban, and take off the crown;
Ezekiel	021	027	I will overturn, overturn, overturn it:  this also shall be no more,
Ezekiel	021	028	You, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh
Ezekiel	021	029	while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you,
Ezekiel	021	030	Cause it to return into its sheath.  In the place where you
Ezekiel	021	031	I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you
Ezekiel	021	032	You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in
Ezekiel	022	001	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	022	002	You, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody
Ezekiel	022	003	You shall say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  A city that
Ezekiel	022	004	You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed,
Ezekiel	022	005	Those who are near, and those who are far from you, shall mock you,
Ezekiel	022	006	Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power,
Ezekiel	022	007	In you have they set light by father and mother; in the midst
Ezekiel	022	008	You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel	022	009	Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood; and in you
Ezekiel	022	010	In you have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you
Ezekiel	022	011	One has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife;
Ezekiel	022	012	In you have they taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken
Ezekiel	022	013	Behold, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest
Ezekiel	022	014	Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days
Ezekiel	022	015	I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through
Ezekiel	022	016	You shall be profaned in yourself, in the sight of the nations;
Ezekiel	022	017	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	022	018	Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me:
Ezekiel	022	019	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are all
Ezekiel	022	020	As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
Ezekiel	022	021	Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath,
Ezekiel	022	022	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall
Ezekiel	022	023	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	022	024	Son of man, tell her, You are a land that is not cleansed,
Ezekiel	022	025	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of it,
Ezekiel	022	026	Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned
Ezekiel	022	027	Her princes in the midst of it are like wolves ravening
Ezekiel	022	028	Her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing
Ezekiel	022	029	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery;
Ezekiel	022	030	I sought for a man among them, who should build up the wall,
Ezekiel	022	031	Therefore have I poured out my indignation on them;
Ezekiel	023	001	The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	023	002	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
Ezekiel	023	003	and they played the prostitute in Egypt; they played the
Ezekiel	023	004	The names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister:
Ezekiel	023	005	Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted
Ezekiel	023	006	who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them
Ezekiel	023	007	She bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria
Ezekiel	023	008	Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt;
Ezekiel	023	009	Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
Ezekiel	023	010	These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters;
Ezekiel	023	011	Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her
Ezekiel	023	012	She doted on the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors,
Ezekiel	023	013	I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.
Ezekiel	023	014	She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on
Ezekiel	023	015	girded with girdles on their waists, with flowing turbans on
Ezekiel	023	016	As soon as she saw them she doted on them, and sent messengers
Ezekiel	023	017	The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled
Ezekiel	023	018	So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness:
Ezekiel	023	019	Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days
Ezekiel	023	020	She doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
Ezekiel	023	021	Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth,
Ezekiel	023	022	Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will raise
Ezekiel	023	023	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa,
Ezekiel	023	024	They shall come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons,
Ezekiel	023	025	I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with
Ezekiel	023	026	They shall also strip you of your clothes, and take away
Ezekiel	023	027	Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you,
Ezekiel	023	028	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will deliver you
Ezekiel	023	029	and they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take
Ezekiel	023	030	These things shall be done to you, because you have played
Ezekiel	023	031	You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I
Ezekiel	023	032	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You will drink of your sister's cup,
Ezekiel	023	033	You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of
Ezekiel	023	034	You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall
Ezekiel	023	035	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have forgotten me,
Ezekiel	023	036	Yahweh said moreover to me:  Son of man, will you judge Oholah
Ezekiel	023	037	For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands;
Ezekiel	023	038	Moreover this they have done to me:  they have defiled my
Ezekiel	023	039	For when they had slain their children to their idols,
Ezekiel	023	040	Furthermore you have sent for men who come from far,
Ezekiel	023	041	and sit on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it,
Ezekiel	023	042	The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her:
Ezekiel	023	043	Then said I of her who was old in adulteries, Now will they
Ezekiel	023	044	They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute:
Ezekiel	023	045	Righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment
Ezekiel	023	046	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will bring up a company
Ezekiel	023	047	The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with
Ezekiel	023	048	Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
Ezekiel	023	049	They shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall
Ezekiel	024	001	Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth
Ezekiel	024	002	Son of man, write you the name of the day, [even] of this same day:
Ezekiel	024	003	Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them,
Ezekiel	024	004	gather the pieces of it into it, even every good piece,
Ezekiel	024	005	Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile [of wood]
Ezekiel	024	006	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the bloody city,
Ezekiel	024	007	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock;
Ezekiel	024	008	That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set
Ezekiel	024	009	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the bloody city!
Ezekiel	024	010	Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh,
Ezekiel	024	011	Then set it empty on the coals of it, that it may be hot,
Ezekiel	024	012	She has wearied [herself] with toil; yet her great rust doesn't
Ezekiel	024	013	In your filthiness is lewdness:  because I have cleansed you
Ezekiel	024	014	I, Yahweh, have spoken it:  it shall happen, and I will do it:
Ezekiel	024	015	Also the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	024	016	Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your
Ezekiel	024	017	Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead;
Ezekiel	024	018	So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at even my wife died;
Ezekiel	024	019	The people said to me, Won't you tell us what these things
Ezekiel	024	020	Then I said to them, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	024	021	Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I
Ezekiel	024	022	You shall do as I have done:  you shall not cover your lips,
Ezekiel	024	023	Your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet:
Ezekiel	024	024	Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has
Ezekiel	024	025	You, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
Ezekiel	024	026	that in that day he who escapes shall come to you, to cause
Ezekiel	024	027	In that day shall your mouth be opened to him who is escaped,
Ezekiel	025	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	025	002	Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon,
Ezekiel	025	003	and tell the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the
Ezekiel	025	004	therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east
Ezekiel	025	005	I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children
Ezekiel	025	006	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have clapped your hands,
Ezekiel	025	007	therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you,
Ezekiel	025	008	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because Moab and Seir say, Behold,
Ezekiel	025	009	therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities,
Ezekiel	025	010	to the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon;
Ezekiel	025	011	and I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know
Ezekiel	025	012	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because Edom has dealt against
Ezekiel	025	013	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, I will stretch out my
Ezekiel	025	014	I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel;
Ezekiel	025	015	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because the Philistines have dealt
Ezekiel	025	016	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will stretch out
Ezekiel	025	017	I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes;
Ezekiel	026	001	It happened in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month,
Ezekiel	026	002	Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha,
Ezekiel	026	003	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I am against you,
Ezekiel	026	004	They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers:
Ezekiel	026	005	She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst
Ezekiel	026	006	Her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword:
Ezekiel	026	007	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will bring
Ezekiel	026	008	He shall kill with the sword your daughters in the field;
Ezekiel	026	009	He shall set his battering engines against your walls,
Ezekiel	026	010	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you:
Ezekiel	026	011	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets;
Ezekiel	026	012	They shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey
Ezekiel	026	013	I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound
Ezekiel	026	014	I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place
Ezekiel	026	015	Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre:  shall not the islands
Ezekiel	026	016	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones,
Ezekiel	026	017	They shall take up a lamentation over you, and tell you,
Ezekiel	026	018	Now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall;
Ezekiel	026	019	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When I shall make you
Ezekiel	026	020	then will I bring you down with those who descend into the pit,
Ezekiel	026	021	I will make you a terror, and you shall no more have any being;
Ezekiel	027	001	The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	027	002	You, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
Ezekiel	027	003	and tell Tyre, you who dwell at the entry of the sea,
Ezekiel	027	004	Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders
Ezekiel	027	005	They have made all your planks of fir trees from Senir;
Ezekiel	027	006	Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars;
Ezekiel	027	007	Of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail,
Ezekiel	027	008	The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers:
Ezekiel	027	009	The old men of Gebal and the wise men of it were in you your
Ezekiel	027	010	Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war:
Ezekiel	027	011	The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about,
Ezekiel	027	012	Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude
Ezekiel	027	013	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traffickers;
Ezekiel	027	014	They of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses
Ezekiel	027	015	The men of Dedan were your traffickers; many islands were
Ezekiel	027	016	Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of
Ezekiel	027	017	Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your traffickers:
Ezekiel	027	018	Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks,
Ezekiel	027	019	Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for your wares:
Ezekiel	027	020	Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding.
Ezekiel	027	021	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants
Ezekiel	027	022	The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traffickers;
Ezekiel	027	023	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur
Ezekiel	027	024	These were your traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings
Ezekiel	027	025	The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise:
Ezekiel	027	026	Your rowers have brought you into great waters:
Ezekiel	027	027	Your riches, and your wares, your merchandise, your mariners,
Ezekiel	027	028	At the sound of the cry of your pilots the suburbs shall shake.
Ezekiel	027	029	All who handled the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots
Ezekiel	027	030	and shall cause their voice to be heard over you, and shall
Ezekiel	027	031	and they shall make themselves bald for you, and gird them
Ezekiel	027	032	In their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you,
Ezekiel	027	033	When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many peoples;
Ezekiel	027	034	In the time that you were broken by the seas in the depths
Ezekiel	027	035	All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you,
Ezekiel	027	036	The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you are become
Ezekiel	028	001	The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	028	002	Son of man, tell the prince of Tyre, Thus says the
Ezekiel	028	003	behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is
Ezekiel	028	004	by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten you riches,
Ezekiel	028	005	by your great wisdom [and] by your traffic have you increased
Ezekiel	028	006	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because you have set
Ezekiel	028	007	therefore, behold, I will bring strangers on you, the terrible
Ezekiel	028	008	They shall bring you down to the pit; and you shall die the death
Ezekiel	028	009	Will you yet say before him who kills you, I am God? but you
Ezekiel	028	010	You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand
Ezekiel	028	011	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	028	012	Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre,
Ezekiel	028	013	You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone
Ezekiel	028	014	You were the anointed cherub who covers:  and I set you,
Ezekiel	028	015	You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created,
Ezekiel	028	016	By the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you
Ezekiel	028	017	Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you have
Ezekiel	028	018	By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness
Ezekiel	028	019	All those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you:
Ezekiel	028	020	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	028	021	Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel	028	022	and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against
Ezekiel	028	023	For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets;
Ezekiel	028	024	There shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	028	025	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When I shall have gathered the house
Ezekiel	028	026	They shall dwell securely therein; yes, they shall build houses,
Ezekiel	029	001	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day
Ezekiel	029	002	"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,
Ezekiel	029	003	Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I am
Ezekiel	029	004	I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish
Ezekiel	029	005	I'll cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all
Ezekiel	029	006	All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,
Ezekiel	029	007	When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore
Ezekiel	029	008	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I will bring
Ezekiel	029	009	The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste;
Ezekiel	029	010	therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers,
Ezekiel	029	011	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall
Ezekiel	029	012	I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst
Ezekiel	029	013	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "At the end of forty years will I
Ezekiel	029	014	and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them
Ezekiel	029	015	It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more
Ezekiel	029	016	It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	029	017	It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month],
Ezekiel	029	018	Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
Ezekiel	029	019	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will give
Ezekiel	029	020	I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which
Ezekiel	029	021	In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	030	001	The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	030	002	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Wail, Alas
Ezekiel	030	003	For the day is near, even the day of Yahweh is near;
Ezekiel	030	004	A sword shall come on Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia,
Ezekiel	030	005	Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub,
Ezekiel	030	006	Thus says Yahweh:  They also who uphold Egypt shall fall;
Ezekiel	030	007	They shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that
Ezekiel	030	008	They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt,
Ezekiel	030	009	In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships
Ezekiel	030	010	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also make the multitude of
Ezekiel	030	011	He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations,
Ezekiel	030	012	I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into
Ezekiel	030	013	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also destroy the idols,
Ezekiel	030	014	I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan,
Ezekiel	030	015	I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt;
Ezekiel	030	016	I will set a fire in Egypt:  Sin shall be in great anguish,
Ezekiel	030	017	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword;
Ezekiel	030	018	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall
Ezekiel	030	019	Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt; and they shall know
Ezekiel	030	020	It happened in the eleventh year, in the first [month],
Ezekiel	030	021	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
Ezekiel	030	022	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against Pharaoh
Ezekiel	030	023	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
Ezekiel	030	024	I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
Ezekiel	030	025	I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms
Ezekiel	030	026	I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them
Ezekiel	031	001	It happened in the eleventh year, in the third [month],
Ezekiel	031	002	Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:
Ezekiel	031	003	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful
Ezekiel	031	004	The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow:
Ezekiel	031	005	Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;
Ezekiel	031	006	All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs;
Ezekiel	031	007	Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches;
Ezekiel	031	008	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir
Ezekiel	031	009	I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,
Ezekiel	031	010	Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are exalted
Ezekiel	031	011	I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of
Ezekiel	031	012	Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
Ezekiel	031	013	On his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell, and all
Ezekiel	031	014	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
Ezekiel	031	015	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day when he went down to
Ezekiel	031	016	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
Ezekiel	031	017	They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain
Ezekiel	031	018	To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees
Ezekiel	032	001	It happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
Ezekiel	032	002	Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt,
Ezekiel	032	003	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will spread out my net on you
Ezekiel	032	004	I will leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field,
Ezekiel	032	005	I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys
Ezekiel	032	006	I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim,
Ezekiel	032	007	When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make
Ezekiel	032	008	All the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you,
Ezekiel	032	009	I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall
Ezekiel	032	010	Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings
Ezekiel	032	011	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The sword of the king of Babylon
Ezekiel	032	012	By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall;
Ezekiel	032	013	I will destroy also all the animals of it from beside many waters;
Ezekiel	032	014	Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers
Ezekiel	032	015	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,
Ezekiel	032	016	This is the lamentation with which they shall lament;
Ezekiel	032	017	It happened also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day]
Ezekiel	032	018	Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down,
Ezekiel	032	019	Whom do you pass in beauty?  Go down, and be laid
Ezekiel	032	020	They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword:
Ezekiel	032	021	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
Ezekiel	032	022	Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her;
Ezekiel	032	023	whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit,
Ezekiel	032	024	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave;
Ezekiel	032	025	They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain
Ezekiel	032	026	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are
Ezekiel	032	027	They shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of
Ezekiel	032	028	But you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
Ezekiel	032	029	There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their
Ezekiel	032	030	There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all
Ezekiel	032	031	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all
Ezekiel	032	032	For I have put his terror in the land of the living;
Ezekiel	033	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	033	002	Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them,
Ezekiel	033	003	if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet,
Ezekiel	033	004	then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn't
Ezekiel	033	005	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn't take warning;
Ezekiel	033	006	But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn't blow the trumpet,
Ezekiel	033	007	So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house
Ezekiel	033	008	When I tell the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die,
Ezekiel	033	009	Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it,
Ezekiel	033	010	You, son of man, tell the house of Israel:  Thus you speak,
Ezekiel	033	011	Tell them, As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I have no pleasure
Ezekiel	033	012	You, son of man, tell the children of your people,
Ezekiel	033	013	When I tell the righteous, that he shall surely live;
Ezekiel	033	014	Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die;
Ezekiel	033	015	if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken
Ezekiel	033	016	None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered
Ezekiel	033	017	Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord
Ezekiel	033	018	When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity,
Ezekiel	033	019	When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which
Ezekiel	033	020	Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.
Ezekiel	033	021	It happened in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
Ezekiel	033	022	Now the hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening,
Ezekiel	033	023	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	033	024	Son of man, they who inhabit those waste places in the land of
Ezekiel	033	025	Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You eat with
Ezekiel	033	026	You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and you defile
Ezekiel	033	027	Thus shall you tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As I live,
Ezekiel	033	028	I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment;
Ezekiel	033	029	Then shall they know that I am Yahweh, when I have made
Ezekiel	033	030	As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk
Ezekiel	033	031	They come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you
Ezekiel	033	032	Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has
Ezekiel	033	033	When this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then shall they
Ezekiel	034	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	034	002	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
Ezekiel	034	003	You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill
Ezekiel	034	004	You haven't strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed
Ezekiel	034	005	They were scattered, because there was no shepherd;
Ezekiel	034	006	My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill:
Ezekiel	034	007	Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
Ezekiel	034	008	As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely because my sheep became
Ezekiel	034	009	therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
Ezekiel	034	010	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against the shepherds;
Ezekiel	034	011	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I myself, even I,
Ezekiel	034	012	As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among
Ezekiel	034	013	I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from
Ezekiel	034	014	I will feed them with good pasture; and on the mountains
Ezekiel	034	015	I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause
Ezekiel	034	016	I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back
Ezekiel	034	017	As for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I judge
Ezekiel	034	018	Seems it a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture,
Ezekiel	034	019	As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet,
Ezekiel	034	020	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them:  Behold, I, even I,
Ezekiel	034	021	Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all
Ezekiel	034	022	therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey;
Ezekiel	034	023	I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,
Ezekiel	034	024	I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince
Ezekiel	034	025	I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
Ezekiel	034	026	I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;
Ezekiel	034	027	The tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall
Ezekiel	034	028	They shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall
Ezekiel	034	029	I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall
Ezekiel	034	030	They shall know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them,
Ezekiel	034	031	You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,
Ezekiel	035	001	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	035	002	Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel	035	003	and tell it, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,
Ezekiel	035	004	I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate;
Ezekiel	035	005	Because you have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over
Ezekiel	035	006	therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will prepare
Ezekiel	035	007	Thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation;
Ezekiel	035	008	I will fill its mountains with its slain:  in your hills
Ezekiel	035	009	I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall
Ezekiel	035	010	Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries
Ezekiel	035	011	therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will do according
Ezekiel	035	012	You shall know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults
Ezekiel	035	013	You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth,
Ezekiel	035	014	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When the whole earth rejoices,
Ezekiel	035	015	As you did rejoice over the inheritance of the house
Ezekiel	036	001	You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say,
Ezekiel	036	002	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because the enemy has said against you,
Ezekiel	036	003	therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because, even
Ezekiel	036	004	therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the
Ezekiel	036	005	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Surely in the fire of my
Ezekiel	036	006	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell
Ezekiel	036	007	therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I have sworn, [saying],
Ezekiel	036	008	But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches,
Ezekiel	036	009	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and you
Ezekiel	036	010	and I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	036	011	and I will multiply on you man and animal; and they shall increase
Ezekiel	036	012	Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel;
Ezekiel	036	013	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because they say to you,
Ezekiel	036	014	therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your
Ezekiel	036	015	neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations,
Ezekiel	036	016	Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	036	017	Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land,
Ezekiel	036	018	Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they
Ezekiel	036	019	and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed
Ezekiel	036	020	When they came to the nations, where they went, they profaned
Ezekiel	036	021	But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel
Ezekiel	036	022	Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the
Ezekiel	036	023	I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among
Ezekiel	036	024	For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out
Ezekiel	036	025	I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean:
Ezekiel	036	026	A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
Ezekiel	036	027	I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
Ezekiel	036	028	You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
Ezekiel	036	029	I will save you from all your uncleanness:  and I will call
Ezekiel	036	030	I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase
Ezekiel	036	031	Then shall you remember your evil ways, and your doings that
Ezekiel	036	032	Nor for your sake do I [this], says the Lord Yahweh, be it
Ezekiel	036	033	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day that I cleanse you from
Ezekiel	036	034	The land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was
Ezekiel	036	035	They shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
Ezekiel	036	036	Then the nations that are left round about you shall know
Ezekiel	036	037	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  For this, moreover, will I
Ezekiel	036	038	As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her
Ezekiel	037	001	The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit
Ezekiel	037	002	He caused me to pass by them round about:  and behold,
Ezekiel	037	003	He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live?  I answered,
Ezekiel	037	004	Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them,
Ezekiel	037	005	Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones:  Behold, I will cause
Ezekiel	037	006	I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you,
Ezekiel	037	007	So I prophesied as I was commanded:  and as I prophesied,
Ezekiel	037	008	I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up,
Ezekiel	037	009	Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man,
Ezekiel	037	010	So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came
Ezekiel	037	011	Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
Ezekiel	037	012	Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the
Ezekiel	037	013	You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves,
Ezekiel	037	014	I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place
Ezekiel	037	015	The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
Ezekiel	037	016	You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah,
Ezekiel	037	017	and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they
Ezekiel	037	018	When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying,
Ezekiel	037	019	tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take
Ezekiel	037	020	The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel	037	021	Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take
Ezekiel	037	022	and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains
Ezekiel	037	023	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
Ezekiel	037	024	My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall
Ezekiel	037	025	They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant,
Ezekiel	037	026	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
Ezekiel	037	027	My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God,
Ezekiel	037	028	The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel,
Ezekiel	038	001	The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
Ezekiel	038	002	Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog,
Ezekiel	038	003	and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,
Ezekiel	038	004	and I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I
Ezekiel	038	005	Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel	038	006	Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in
Ezekiel	038	007	Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies
Ezekiel	038	008	After many days you shall be visited:  in the latter years you
Ezekiel	038	009	You shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall
Ezekiel	038	010	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  It shall happen in that day,
Ezekiel	038	011	and you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages;
Ezekiel	038	012	to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn your hand
Ezekiel	038	013	Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all
Ezekiel	038	014	Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, Thus says the
Ezekiel	038	015	You shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts
Ezekiel	038	016	and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud
Ezekiel	038	017	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Are you he of whom I spoke in old
Ezekiel	038	018	It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land
Ezekiel	038	019	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
Ezekiel	038	020	so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky,
Ezekiel	038	021	I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains,
Ezekiel	038	022	With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment
Ezekiel	038	023	I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make
Ezekiel	039	001	You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says
Ezekiel	039	002	and I will turn you about, and will lead you on, and will
Ezekiel	039	003	and I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause
Ezekiel	039	004	You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all
Ezekiel	039	005	You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken it,
Ezekiel	039	006	I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely
Ezekiel	039	007	My holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel;
Ezekiel	039	008	Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh;
Ezekiel	039	009	Those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
Ezekiel	039	010	so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
Ezekiel	039	011	It shall happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place
Ezekiel	039	012	Seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them,
Ezekiel	039	013	Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
Ezekiel	039	014	They shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass
Ezekiel	039	015	Those who pass through the land shall pass through;
Ezekiel	039	016	Hamonah shall also be the name of a city.  Thus shall they
Ezekiel	039	017	You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Speak to
Ezekiel	039	018	You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood
Ezekiel	039	019	You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you
Ezekiel	039	020	You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
Ezekiel	039	021	I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations
Ezekiel	039	022	So the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God,
Ezekiel	039	023	The nations shall know that the house of Israel went into
Ezekiel	039	024	According to their uncleanness and according to their
Ezekiel	039	025	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Now will I bring back
Ezekiel	039	026	They shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by
Ezekiel	039	027	when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered
Ezekiel	039	028	They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused
Ezekiel	039	029	neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured
Ezekiel	040	001	In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
Ezekiel	040	002	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
Ezekiel	040	003	He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man,
Ezekiel	040	004	The man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear
Ezekiel	040	005	Behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about,
Ezekiel	040	006	Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went
Ezekiel	040	007	Every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad;
Ezekiel	040	008	He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
Ezekiel	040	009	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits;
Ezekiel	040	010	The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side,
Ezekiel	040	011	He measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits;
Ezekiel	040	012	and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side],
Ezekiel	040	013	He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to
Ezekiel	040	014	He made also posts, sixty cubits; and the court [reached]
Ezekiel	040	015	[From] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront
Ezekiel	040	016	There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts
Ezekiel	040	017	Then brought he me into the outer court; and behold, there were
Ezekiel	040	018	The pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to
Ezekiel	040	019	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate
Ezekiel	040	020	The gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north,
Ezekiel	040	021	The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side;
Ezekiel	040	022	The windows of it, and the arches of it, and the palm trees
Ezekiel	040	023	There was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate,
Ezekiel	040	024	He led me toward the south; and behold, a gate toward the south:
Ezekiel	040	025	There were windows in it and in the arches of it round about,
Ezekiel	040	026	There were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches of it
Ezekiel	040	027	There was a gate to the inner court toward the south:
Ezekiel	040	028	Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate:
Ezekiel	040	029	and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,
Ezekiel	040	030	There were arches round about, twenty-five cubits long,
Ezekiel	040	031	The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
Ezekiel	040	032	He brought me into the inner court toward the east:
Ezekiel	040	033	and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,
Ezekiel	040	034	The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
Ezekiel	040	035	He brought me to the north gate:  and he measured [it] according
Ezekiel	040	036	the lodges of it, the posts of it, and the arches of it:
Ezekiel	040	037	The posts of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees
Ezekiel	040	038	A chamber with the door of it was by the posts at the gates;
Ezekiel	040	039	In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side,
Ezekiel	040	040	On the [one] side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate
Ezekiel	040	041	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
Ezekiel	040	042	There were four tables for the burnt offering, of hewn stone,
Ezekiel	040	043	The hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about:
Ezekiel	040	044	Outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers
Ezekiel	040	045	He said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south,
Ezekiel	040	046	and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is
Ezekiel	040	047	He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred
Ezekiel	040	048	Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
Ezekiel	040	049	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
Ezekiel	041	001	He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits
Ezekiel	041	002	The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides
Ezekiel	041	003	Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance,
Ezekiel	041	004	He measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth,
Ezekiel	041	005	Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits;
Ezekiel	041	006	The side chambers were in three stories, one over another,
Ezekiel	041	007	The side chambers were broader as they encompassed [the
Ezekiel	041	008	I saw also that the house had a raised base round about:
Ezekiel	041	009	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers,
Ezekiel	041	010	Between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round
Ezekiel	041	011	The doors of the side chambers were toward [the place] that was left,
Ezekiel	041	012	The building that was before the separate place at the side
Ezekiel	041	013	So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long;
Ezekiel	041	014	also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
Ezekiel	041	015	He measured the length of the building before the separate
Ezekiel	041	016	the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round
Ezekiel	041	017	to [the space] above the door, even to the inner house, and outside,
Ezekiel	041	018	It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was
Ezekiel	041	019	so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on
Ezekiel	041	020	from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made:
Ezekiel	041	021	As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face
Ezekiel	041	022	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it
Ezekiel	041	023	The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
Ezekiel	041	024	The doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves:
Ezekiel	041	025	There were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
Ezekiel	041	026	There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side
Ezekiel	042	001	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward
Ezekiel	042	002	Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door,
Ezekiel	042	003	Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court,
Ezekiel	042	004	Before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward,
Ezekiel	042	005	Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took
Ezekiel	042	006	For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars
Ezekiel	042	007	The wall that was outside by the side of the chambers,
Ezekiel	042	008	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court
Ezekiel	042	009	From under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
Ezekiel	042	010	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east,
Ezekiel	042	011	The way before them was like the appearance of [the way of]
Ezekiel	042	012	According to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south
Ezekiel	042	013	Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
Ezekiel	042	014	When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of
Ezekiel	042	015	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,
Ezekiel	042	016	He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five
Ezekiel	042	017	He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring
Ezekiel	042	018	He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with
Ezekiel	042	019	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
Ezekiel	042	020	He measured it on the four sides:  it had a wall round about,
Ezekiel	043	001	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks
Ezekiel	043	002	Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
Ezekiel	043	003	It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
Ezekiel	043	004	The glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate
Ezekiel	043	005	The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
Ezekiel	043	006	I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man
Ezekiel	043	007	He said to me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne,
Ezekiel	043	008	in their setting of their threshold by my threshold,
Ezekiel	043	009	Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies
Ezekiel	043	010	You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel,
Ezekiel	043	011	If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them
Ezekiel	043	012	This is the law of the house:  on the top of the mountain
Ezekiel	043	013	These are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit
Ezekiel	043	014	From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall
Ezekiel	043	015	The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth
Ezekiel	043	016	The altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad,
Ezekiel	043	017	The ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad
Ezekiel	043	018	He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  These are
Ezekiel	043	019	You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of
Ezekiel	043	020	You shall take of the blood of it, and put it on the four horns of it,
Ezekiel	043	021	You shall also take the bull of the sin offering,
Ezekiel	043	022	On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish
Ezekiel	043	023	When you have made an end of cleansing it, you shall offer a young
Ezekiel	043	024	You shall bring them near before Yahweh, and the priests shall
Ezekiel	043	025	Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering:
Ezekiel	043	026	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it;
Ezekiel	043	027	When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on
Ezekiel	044	001	Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary,
Ezekiel	044	002	Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened,
Ezekiel	044	003	As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread
Ezekiel	044	004	Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house;
Ezekiel	044	005	Yahweh said to me, Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes,
Ezekiel	044	006	You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says
Ezekiel	044	007	in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in
Ezekiel	044	008	You have not kept the charge of my holy things; but you have
Ezekiel	044	009	Thus says the Lord Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart
Ezekiel	044	010	But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray,
Ezekiel	044	011	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight
Ezekiel	044	012	Because they ministered to them before their idols,
Ezekiel	044	013	They shall not come near to me, to execute the office
Ezekiel	044	014	Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all
Ezekiel	044	015	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept
Ezekiel	044	016	they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
Ezekiel	044	017	It shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the
Ezekiel	044	018	They shall have linen tires on their heads, and shall have linen
Ezekiel	044	019	When they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer
Ezekiel	044	020	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks
Ezekiel	044	021	Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter
Ezekiel	044	022	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is
Ezekiel	044	023	They shall teach my people the difference between the holy
Ezekiel	044	024	In a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my
Ezekiel	044	025	They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves;
Ezekiel	044	026	After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
Ezekiel	044	027	In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court,
Ezekiel	044	028	They shall have an inheritance:  I am their inheritance; and you
Ezekiel	044	029	They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering,
Ezekiel	044	030	The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering
Ezekiel	044	031	The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself,
Ezekiel	045	001	Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
Ezekiel	045	002	Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in
Ezekiel	045	003	Of this measure shall you measure a length of twenty-five thousand,
Ezekiel	045	004	It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests,
Ezekiel	045	005	Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth,
Ezekiel	045	006	You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad,
Ezekiel	045	007	[Whatever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on
Ezekiel	045	008	In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel:
Ezekiel	045	009	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Let it suffice you, princes of Israel:
Ezekiel	045	010	You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
Ezekiel	045	011	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
Ezekiel	045	012	The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.  Twenty shekels plus
Ezekiel	045	013	This is the offering that you shall offer:  the sixth part
Ezekiel	045	014	and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part
Ezekiel	045	015	and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered
Ezekiel	045	016	All the people of the land shall give to this offering for
Ezekiel	045	017	It shall be the prince's part to give the burnt offerings,
Ezekiel	045	018	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the first [month], in the first
Ezekiel	045	019	The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
Ezekiel	045	020	So you shall do on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone
Ezekiel	045	021	In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month,
Ezekiel	045	022	On that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all
Ezekiel	045	023	The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
Ezekiel	045	024	He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bull,
Ezekiel	045	025	In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month,
Ezekiel	046	001	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The gate of the inner court that
Ezekiel	046	002	The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside,
Ezekiel	046	003	The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate
Ezekiel	046	004	The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh
Ezekiel	046	005	and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram,
Ezekiel	046	006	On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish,
Ezekiel	046	007	and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull,
Ezekiel	046	008	When the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch
Ezekiel	046	009	But when the people of the land shall come before Yahweh
Ezekiel	046	010	The prince, when they go in, shall go in with of them;
Ezekiel	046	011	In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering
Ezekiel	046	012	When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt
Ezekiel	046	013	You shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a
Ezekiel	046	014	You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning,
Ezekiel	046	015	Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering,
Ezekiel	046	016	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  If the prince give a gift to any
Ezekiel	046	017	But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants,
Ezekiel	046	018	Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance,
Ezekiel	046	019	Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
Ezekiel	046	020	He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil
Ezekiel	046	021	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused
Ezekiel	046	022	In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed,
Ezekiel	046	023	There was a wall round about in them, round about the four,
Ezekiel	046	024	Then said he to me, These are the boiling houses, where the
Ezekiel	047	001	He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold,
Ezekiel	047	002	Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward,
Ezekiel	047	003	When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand,
Ezekiel	047	004	Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through
Ezekiel	047	005	Afterward he measured one thousand; [and it was] a river
Ezekiel	047	006	He said to me, Son of man, have you seen [this]?
Ezekiel	047	007	Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river
Ezekiel	047	008	Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward
Ezekiel	047	009	It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms,
Ezekiel	047	010	It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it:
Ezekiel	047	011	But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not
Ezekiel	047	012	By the river on the bank of it, on this side and on that side,
Ezekiel	047	013	Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This shall be the border, by which you
Ezekiel	047	014	You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore
Ezekiel	047	015	This shall be the border of the land:  On the north side,
Ezekiel	047	016	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border
Ezekiel	047	017	The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border
Ezekiel	047	018	The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead,
Ezekiel	047	019	The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters
Ezekiel	047	020	The west side shall be the great sea, from the [south]
Ezekiel	047	021	So shall you divide this land to you according to the
Ezekiel	047	022	It shall happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an
Ezekiel	047	023	It shall happen, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns,
Ezekiel	048	001	Now these are the names of the tribes:  From the north end,
Ezekiel	048	002	By the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	003	By the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	004	By the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	005	By the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side,

Ezekiel	048	007	By the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	008	By the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	009	The offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty-five
Ezekiel	048	010	For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering:
Ezekiel	048	011	[It shall be] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons
Ezekiel	048	012	It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land,
Ezekiel	048	013	Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have
Ezekiel	048	014	They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first
Ezekiel	048	015	The five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front
Ezekiel	048	016	These shall be the measures of it:  the north side four thousand
Ezekiel	048	017	The city shall have suburbs:  toward the north two hundred fifty,
Ezekiel	048	018	The remainder in the length, answerable to the holy offering,
Ezekiel	048	019	Those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel,
Ezekiel	048	020	All the offering shall be twenty-five thousand by
Ezekiel	048	021	The residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on
Ezekiel	048	022	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession
Ezekiel	048	023	As for the rest of the tribes:  from the east side to the
Ezekiel	048	024	By the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	025	By the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	026	By the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	027	By the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side,
Ezekiel	048	028	By the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border
Ezekiel	048	029	This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes
Ezekiel	048	030	These are the exits of the city:  On the north side four
Ezekiel	048	031	and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes
Ezekiel	048	032	At the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],
Ezekiel	048	033	At the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds]
Ezekiel	048	034	At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],
Ezekiel	048	035	It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about:
Daniel	001	001	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Daniel	001	002	The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand,
Daniel	001	003	The king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
Daniel	001	004	youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skillful in
Daniel	001	005	The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's dainties,
Daniel	001	006	Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel,
Daniel	001	007	The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them:  to Daniel he gave
Daniel	001	008	But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
Daniel	001	009	Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight
Daniel	001	010	The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord
Daniel	001	011	Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs
Daniel	001	012	Prove your servants, I beg you, ten days; and let them give
Daniel	001	013	Then let our faces be looked on before you, and the face
Daniel	001	014	So he listened to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
Daniel	001	015	At the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer,
Daniel	001	016	So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they
Daniel	001	017	Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill
Daniel	001	018	At the end of the days which the king had appointed for
Daniel	001	019	The king talked with them; and among them all was found
Daniel	001	020	In every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which
Daniel	001	021	Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.
Daniel	002	001	In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar
Daniel	002	002	Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters,
Daniel	002	003	The king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
Daniel	002	004	Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language,
Daniel	002	005	The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me:
Daniel	002	006	But if you show the dream and the interpretation of it,
Daniel	002	007	They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell
Daniel	002	008	The king answered, I know of a certainty that you would gain time,
Daniel	002	009	But if you don't make known to me the dream, there is but
Daniel	002	010	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is
Daniel	002	011	It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no
Daniel	002	012	For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
Daniel	002	013	So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain;
Daniel	002	014	Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch
Daniel	002	015	he answered Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent
Daniel	002	016	Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint
Daniel	002	017	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known
Daniel	002	018	that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
Daniel	002	019	Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night.
Daniel	002	020	Daniel answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;
Daniel	002	021	He changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings,
Daniel	002	022	he reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in
Daniel	002	023	I thank you, and praise you, you God of my fathers,
Daniel	002	024	Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed
Daniel	002	025	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
Daniel	002	026	The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you
Daniel	002	027	Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king
Daniel	002	028	but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made
Daniel	002	029	as for you, O king, your thoughts came [into your mind] on
Daniel	002	030	But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
Daniel	002	031	You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image.  This image,
Daniel	002	032	As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast
Daniel	002	033	its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.
Daniel	002	034	You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck
Daniel	002	035	Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver,
Daniel	002	036	This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it
Daniel	002	037	You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has
Daniel	002	038	and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field
Daniel	002	039	After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you;
Daniel	002	040	The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks
Daniel	002	041	Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters'
Daniel	002	042	As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
Daniel	002	043	Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle
Daniel	002	044	In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom
Daniel	002	045	Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain
Daniel	002	046	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel,
Daniel	002	047	The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God
Daniel	002	048	Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts,
Daniel	002	049	Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach,
Daniel	003	001	Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
Daniel	003	002	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps,
Daniel	003	003	Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges,
Daniel	003	004	Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded,
Daniel	003	005	that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither,
Daniel	003	006	and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall the same hour
Daniel	003	007	Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound
Daniel	003	008	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought
Daniel	003	009	They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel	003	010	You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear
Daniel	003	011	and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall be cast into
Daniel	003	012	There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs
Daniel	003	013	Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to
Daniel	003	014	Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach,
Daniel	003	015	Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn,
Daniel	003	016	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar,
Daniel	003	017	If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
Daniel	003	018	But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve
Daniel	003	019	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
Daniel	003	020	He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to
Daniel	003	021	Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics,
Daniel	003	022	Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent,
Daniel	003	023	These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down
Daniel	003	024	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose
Daniel	003	025	He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst
Daniel	003	026	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
Daniel	003	027	The satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the
Daniel	003	028	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God
Daniel	003	029	Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language,
Daniel	003	030	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
Daniel	004	001	Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages,
Daniel	004	002	It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that
Daniel	004	003	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
Daniel	004	004	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing
Daniel	004	005	I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed
Daniel	004	006	Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
Daniel	004	007	Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans,
Daniel	004	008	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar,
Daniel	004	009	Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know
Daniel	004	010	Thus were the visions of my head on my bed:  I saw, and behold,
Daniel	004	011	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height of it reached
Daniel	004	012	The leaves of it were beautiful, and the fruit of it much,
Daniel	004	013	I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold,
Daniel	004	014	He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
Daniel	004	015	Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth,
Daniel	004	016	let his heart be changed from man's, and let an animal's heart
Daniel	004	017	The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand
Daniel	004	018	This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar,
Daniel	004	019	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken
Daniel	004	020	The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height
Daniel	004	021	whose leaves were beautiful, and the fruit of it much, and in it
Daniel	004	022	it is you, O king, that are grown and become strong;
Daniel	004	023	Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down
Daniel	004	024	this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree
Daniel	004	025	that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall
Daniel	004	026	Whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree;
Daniel	004	027	Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you,
Daniel	004	028	All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel	004	029	At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal
Daniel	004	030	The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I
Daniel	004	031	While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from
Daniel	004	032	and you shall be driven from men; and they dwelling shall
Daniel	004	033	The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar:
Daniel	004	034	At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes
Daniel	004	035	All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;
Daniel	004	036	At the same time my understanding returned to me;
Daniel	004	037	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King
Daniel	005	001	Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
Daniel	005	002	Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring
Daniel	005	003	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out
Daniel	005	004	They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
Daniel	005	005	In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand,
Daniel	005	006	Then the king's face was changed in him, and his thoughts
Daniel	005	007	The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans,
Daniel	005	008	Then came in all the king's wise men; but they could not read
Daniel	005	009	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his face was
Daniel	005	010	[Now] the queen by reason of the words of the king and his
Daniel	005	011	There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit
Daniel	005	012	because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
Daniel	005	013	Then was Daniel brought in before the king.  The king spoke
Daniel	005	014	I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you,
Daniel	005	015	Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me,
Daniel	005	016	But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations,
Daniel	005	017	Then Daniel answered before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself,
Daniel	005	018	You king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father
Daniel	005	019	and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples,
Daniel	005	020	But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened
Daniel	005	021	and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made
Daniel	005	022	You his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart,
Daniel	005	023	but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven;
Daniel	005	024	Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this
Daniel	005	025	This is the writing that was inscribed:  MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
Daniel	005	026	This is the interpretation of the thing:  MENE; God has numbered
Daniel	005	027	TEKEL; you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.
Daniel	005	028	PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
Daniel	005	029	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple,
Daniel	005	030	In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
Daniel	005	031	Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about
Daniel	006	001	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps,
Daniel	006	002	and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one;
Daniel	006	003	Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents
Daniel	006	004	Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion
Daniel	006	005	Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
Daniel	006	006	Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king,
Daniel	006	007	All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps,
Daniel	006	008	Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing,
Daniel	006	009	Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
Daniel	006	010	When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house
Daniel	006	011	Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making
Daniel	006	012	Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning
Daniel	006	013	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is
Daniel	006	014	Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased,
Daniel	006	015	Then these men assembled together to the king, and said
Daniel	006	016	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel,
Daniel	006	017	A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den;
Daniel	006	018	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting;
Daniel	006	019	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
Daniel	006	020	When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a
Daniel	006	021	Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever.
Daniel	006	022	My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they
Daniel	006	023	Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they
Daniel	006	024	The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel,
Daniel	006	025	Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages,
Daniel	006	026	I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble
Daniel	006	027	He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in
Daniel	006	028	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign
Daniel	007	001	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel
Daniel	007	002	Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
Daniel	007	003	Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
Daniel	007	004	The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings:
Daniel	007	005	Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up
Daniel	007	006	After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had
Daniel	007	007	After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth
Daniel	007	008	I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among
Daniel	007	009	I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat:
Daniel	007	010	A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him:
Daniel	007	011	I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words
Daniel	007	012	As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away:
Daniel	007	013	I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds
Daniel	007	014	There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
Daniel	007	015	As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body,
Daniel	007	016	I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him
Daniel	007	017	These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall
Daniel	007	018	But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom,
Daniel	007	019	Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal,
Daniel	007	020	and concerning the ten horns that were on its head,
Daniel	007	021	I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints,
Daniel	007	022	until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to
Daniel	007	023	Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom
Daniel	007	024	As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise:
Daniel	007	025	He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear
Daniel	007	026	But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away
Daniel	007	027	The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms
Daniel	007	028	Here is the end of the matter.  As for me, Daniel, my thoughts
Daniel	008	001	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
Daniel	008	002	I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was
Daniel	008	003	Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold,
Daniel	008	004	I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
Daniel	008	005	As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over
Daniel	008	006	He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing
Daniel	008	007	I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger
Daniel	008	008	The male goat magnified himself exceedingly:  and when he was strong,
Daniel	008	009	Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew
Daniel	008	010	It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and some
Daniel	008	011	Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army;
Daniel	008	012	The army was given over [to it] together with the continual
Daniel	008	013	Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said
Daniel	008	014	He said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings
Daniel	008	015	It happened, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
Daniel	008	016	I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called,
Daniel	008	017	So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened,
Daniel	008	018	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my
Daniel	008	019	He said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter
Daniel	008	020	The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings
Daniel	008	021	The rough male goat is the king of Greece:  and the great horn
Daniel	008	022	As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up,
Daniel	008	023	In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
Daniel	008	024	His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall
Daniel	008	025	Through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand;
Daniel	008	026	The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true:
Daniel	008	027	I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up,
Daniel	009	001	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
Daniel	009	002	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books
Daniel	009	003	I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions,
Daniel	009	004	I prayed to Yahweh my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord,
Daniel	009	005	we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly,
Daniel	009	006	neither have we listened to your servants the prophets,
Daniel	009	007	Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of face,
Daniel	009	008	Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes,
Daniel	009	009	To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we
Daniel	009	010	neither have we obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God, to walk
Daniel	009	011	Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even turning aside,
Daniel	009	012	He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us,
Daniel	009	013	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come on us:
Daniel	009	014	Therefore has Yahweh watched over the evil, and brought it on us;
Daniel	009	015	Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of
Daniel	009	016	Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and
Daniel	009	017	Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant,
Daniel	009	018	My God, turn your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and see
Daniel	009	019	Lord, hear; Lord, forgive; Lord, listen and do; don't defer,
Daniel	009	020	While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and
Daniel	009	021	yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had
Daniel	009	022	He instructed me, and talked with me, and said, Daniel, I am
Daniel	009	023	At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went forth,
Daniel	009	024	Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city,
Daniel	009	025	Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth
Daniel	009	026	After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One{"Anointed One"
Daniel	009	027	He shall make a firm covenant with many for one week:
Daniel	010	001	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
Daniel	010	002	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.
Daniel	010	003	I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth,
Daniel	010	004	In the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
Daniel	010	005	I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, a man clothed
Daniel	010	006	his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance
Daniel	010	007	I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me
Daniel	010	008	So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
Daniel	010	009	Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice
Daniel	010	010	Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on
Daniel	010	011	He said to me, Daniel, you man greatly beloved, understand the words
Daniel	010	012	Then said he to me, Don't be afraid, Daniel; for from
Daniel	010	013	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days;
Daniel	010	014	Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen
Daniel	010	015	and when he had spoken to me according to these words,
Daniel	010	016	Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips:
Daniel	010	017	For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
Daniel	010	018	Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man,
Daniel	010	019	He said, "Greatly beloved man, don't be afraid:
Daniel	010	020	Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you?
Daniel	010	021	But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing
Daniel	011	001	"As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up
Daniel	011	002	Now will I show you the truth.  Behold, there shall stand up
Daniel	011	003	A mighty king shall stand up, who shall rule with great dominion,
Daniel	011	004	When he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken,
Daniel	011	005	The king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes;
Daniel	011	006	At the end of years they shall join themselves together;
Daniel	011	007	But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place,
Daniel	011	008	Also their gods, with their molten images, [and] with their goodly
Daniel	011	009	He shall come into the realm of the king of the south,
Daniel	011	010	His sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces,
Daniel	011	011	The king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come
Daniel	011	012	The multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted;
Daniel	011	013	The king of the north shall return, and shall set forth
Daniel	011	014	In those times there shall many stand up against the king
Daniel	011	015	So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound,
Daniel	011	016	But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will,
Daniel	011	017	He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom,
Daniel	011	018	After this shall he turn his face to the islands, and shall
Daniel	011	019	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land;
Daniel	011	020	Then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax
Daniel	011	021	In his place shall stand up a contemptible person,
Daniel	011	022	The overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him,
Daniel	011	023	After the league made with him he shall work deceitfully;
Daniel	011	024	In time of security shall he come even on the fattest places of
Daniel	011	025	He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
Daniel	011	026	Yes, they who eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his
Daniel	011	027	As for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief,
Daniel	011	028	Then shall he return into his land with great substance;
Daniel	011	029	At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south;
Daniel	011	030	For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall
Daniel	011	031	Forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary,
Daniel	011	032	Such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert
Daniel	011	033	Those who are wise among the people shall instruct many;
Daniel	011	034	Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help;
Daniel	011	035	Some of those who are wise shall fall, to refine them,
Daniel	011	036	The king shall do according to his will; and he shall
Daniel	011	037	Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the
Daniel	011	038	But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses;
Daniel	011	039	He shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a
Daniel	011	040	At the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him;
Daniel	011	041	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries]
Daniel	011	042	He shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries;
Daniel	011	043	But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver,
Daniel	011	044	But news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him;
Daniel	011	045	He shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and
Daniel	012	001	"At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who stands
Daniel	012	002	Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
Daniel	012	003	Those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse;
Daniel	012	004	But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
Daniel	012	005	Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood other two,
Daniel	012	006	One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters
Daniel	012	007	I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters
Daniel	012	008	I heard, but I didn't understand:  then said I, my lord,
Daniel	012	009	He said, Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up
Daniel	012	010	Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white,
Daniel	012	011	From the time that the continual [burnt offering] shall be
Daniel	012	012	Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three
Daniel	012	013	But go you your way until the end be; for you shall rest,
Hosea	001	001	The word of Yahweh that came to Hosea the son of Beeri,
Hosea	001	002	When Yahweh spoke at the first by Hosea, Yahweh said
Hosea	001	003	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim;
Hosea	001	004	Yahweh said to him, "Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while,
Hosea	001	005	It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel
Hosea	001	006	She conceived again, and bore a daughter.  Then he said to him,
Hosea	001	007	But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save
Hosea	001	008	Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
Hosea	001	009	He said, "Call his name Lo-Ammi{Lo-Ammi means "not my people"};
Hosea	001	010	Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand
Hosea	001	011	The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be
Hosea	002	001	"Say to your brothers, 'My people!'{'Ammi' in Hebrew} and to
Hosea	002	002	Contend with your mother!  Contend, for she is not my wife,
Hosea	002	003	Lest I strip her naked, and make her bare as in the day
Hosea	002	004	Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy; for they are
Hosea	002	005	For their mother has played the prostitute.  She who conceived them
Hosea	002	006	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I
Hosea	002	007	She will follow after her lovers, but she won't overtake them;
Hosea	002	008	For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine,
Hosea	002	009	Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new
Hosea	002	010	Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
Hosea	002	011	I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:  her feasts,
Hosea	002	012	I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees, about which she
Hosea	002	013	I will visit on her the days of the Baals, to which she burned
Hosea	002	014	"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into
Hosea	002	015	I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley
Hosea	002	016	It will be in that day," says Yahweh, "that you will call me
Hosea	002	017	For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,
Hosea	002	018	In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals
Hosea	002	019	I will betroth you to me forever.  Yes, I will betroth you
Hosea	002	020	I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you
Hosea	002	021	It will happen in that day, I will respond," says Yahweh, "I will
Hosea	002	022	and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine,
Hosea	002	023	I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her
Hosea	003	001	Yahweh said to me, "Go again, love a woman loved by another,
Hosea	003	002	So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver
Hosea	003	003	I said to her, "You shall stay with me many days.  You shall not
Hosea	003	004	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king,
Hosea	003	005	Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek Yahweh
Hosea	004	001	Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel;
Hosea	004	002	There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
Hosea	004	003	Therefore the land will mourn, and everyone who dwells therein
Hosea	004	004	"Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse;
Hosea	004	005	You will stumble in the day, and the prophet will also stumble
Hosea	004	006	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
Hosea	004	007	As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.
Hosea	004	008	They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart
Hosea	004	009	It will be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them
Hosea	004	010	They will eat, and not have enough.  They will play the prostitute,
Hosea	004	011	Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
Hosea	004	012	My people consult with their wooden idol, and answer to a stick
Hosea	004	013	They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense
Hosea	004	014	I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,
Hosea	004	015	"Though you, Israel, play the prostitute, yet don't let Judah offend;
Hosea	004	016	For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.
Hosea	004	017	Ephraim is joined to idols.  Leave him alone!
Hosea	004	018	Their drink has become sour.  They play the prostitute continually.
Hosea	004	019	The wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall
Hosea	005	001	"Listen to this, you priests!  Listen, house of Israel,
Hosea	005	002	The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I discipline all of them.
Hosea	005	003	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me;
Hosea	005	004	Their deeds won't allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit
Hosea	005	005	The pride of Israel testifies to his face.
Hosea	005	006	They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh;
Hosea	005	007	They are unfaithful to Yahweh; for they have borne
Hosea	005	008	"Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah!  Sound a
Hosea	005	009	Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.
Hosea	005	010	The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.
Hosea	005	011	Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; Because he is
Hosea	005	012	Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house
Hosea	005	013	"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound,
Hosea	005	014	For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to
Hosea	005	015	I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge
Hosea	006	001	"Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn us to pieces,
Hosea	006	002	After two days he will revive us.  On the third day he will
Hosea	006	003	Let us acknowledge Yahweh.  Let us press on to know Yahweh.
Hosea	006	004	"Ephraim, what shall I do to you?  Judah, what shall I do to you?
Hosea	006	005	Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;
Hosea	006	006	For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God
Hosea	006	007	But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.
Hosea	006	008	Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is
Hosea	006	009	As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man, so the company of priests
Hosea	006	010	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.
Hosea	006	011	"Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I
Hosea	007	001	When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,
Hosea	007	002	They don't consider in their hearts that I remember all
Hosea	007	003	They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
Hosea	007	004	They are all adulterers.  They are burning like an oven that
Hosea	007	005	On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick
Hosea	007	006	For they have made ready their heart like an oven,
Hosea	007	007	They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges.
Hosea	007	008	Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.  Ephraim is
Hosea	007	009	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he doesn't
Hosea	007	010	The pride of Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven't
Hosea	007	011	"Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.
Hosea	007	012	When they go, I will spread my net on them.  I will bring
Hosea	007	013	Woe to them!  For they have wandered from me.  Destruction to them!
Hosea	007	014	They haven't cried to me with their heart, but they howl on
Hosea	007	015	Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they
Hosea	007	016	They return, but not to the Most High.  They are like a faulty bow.
Hosea	008	001	"Put the trumpet to your lips!  Something like an eagle is
Hosea	008	002	They cry to me, 'My God, we Israel acknowledge you!'
Hosea	008	003	Israel has cast off that which is good.  The enemy will pursue him.
Hosea	008	004	They have set up kings, but not by me.  They have made princes,
Hosea	008	005	Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!  My anger burns against them!
Hosea	008	006	For this is even from Israel!  The workman made it, and it is
Hosea	008	007	For they sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind.
Hosea	008	008	Israel is swallowed up.  Now they are among the nations
Hosea	008	009	For they have gone up to Assyria, like a wild donkey wandering alone.
Hosea	008	010	But although they sold themselves among the nations,
Hosea	008	011	Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, they became
Hosea	008	012	I wrote for him the many things of my law; but they were regarded
Hosea	008	013	As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they sacrifice
Hosea	008	014	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;
Hosea	009	001	Don't rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;
Hosea	009	002	The threshing floor and the winepress won't feed them,
Hosea	009	003	They won't dwell in Yahweh's land; but Ephraim will return
Hosea	009	004	They won't pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will
Hosea	009	005	What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day
Hosea	009	006	For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.
Hosea	009	007	The days of visitation have come.  The days of reckoning have come.
Hosea	009	008	A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.  A fowler's snare
Hosea	009	009	They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah.
Hosea	009	010	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.  I saw your
Hosea	009	011	As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.
Hosea	009	012	Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them,
Hosea	009	013	I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;
Hosea	009	014	Give them--Yahweh what will you give?  Give them a miscarrying
Hosea	009	015	"All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them.
Hosea	009	016	Ephraim is struck.  Their root has dried up.  They will bear
Hosea	009	017	My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him;
Hosea	010	001	Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit.
Hosea	010	002	Their heart is divided.  Now they will be found guilty.
Hosea	010	003	Surely now they will say, "We have no king; for we don't fear Yahweh;
Hosea	010	004	They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.
Hosea	010	005	The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves
Hosea	010	006	It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.
Hosea	010	007	Samaria and her king float away, like a twig on the water.
Hosea	010	008	The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.
Hosea	010	009	"Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.
Hosea	010	010	When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the nations
Hosea	010	011	Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put
Hosea	010	012	Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness.
Hosea	010	013	You have plowed wickedness.  You have reaped iniquity.
Hosea	010	014	Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,
Hosea	010	015	So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.
Hosea	011	001	"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
Hosea	011	002	They called to them, so they went from them.  They sacrificed
Hosea	011	003	Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.  I took them by his arms;
Hosea	011	004	I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; and I
Hosea	011	005	"They won't return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian
Hosea	011	006	The sword will fall on their cities, and will destroy the bars
Hosea	011	007	My people are determined to turn from me.  Though they call
Hosea	011	008	"How can I give you up, Ephraim?  How can I hand
Hosea	011	009	I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.  I will not
Hosea	011	010	They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion;
Hosea	011	011	They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like
Hosea	011	012	Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel
Hosea	012	001	Ephraim feeds on wind, and chases the east wind.
Hosea	012	002	Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob
Hosea	012	003	In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood
Hosea	012	004	Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed; he wept,
Hosea	012	005	even Yahweh, the God of Armies; Yahweh is his name of renown!
Hosea	012	006	Therefore turn to your God.  Keep kindness and justice,
Hosea	012	007	A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.  He loves to defraud.
Hosea	012	008	Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found myself wealth.
Hosea	012	009	"But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt.
Hosea	012	010	I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions;
Hosea	012	011	If Gilead is wicked, surely they are worthless.  In Gilgal
Hosea	012	012	Jacob fled into the country of Aram, and Israel served to get
Hosea	012	013	By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a
Hosea	012	014	Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.  Therefore his blood
Hosea	013	001	When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.  He exalted himself
Hosea	013	002	Now they sin more and more, and have made themselves molten
Hosea	013	003	Therefore they will be like the morning mist, and like the dew
Hosea	013	004	"Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you shall
Hosea	013	005	I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
Hosea	013	006	According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled,
Hosea	013	007	Therefore I am like a lion to them.  Like a leopard, I will
Hosea	013	008	I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,
Hosea	013	009	You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,
Hosea	013	010	Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?
Hosea	013	011	I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away
Hosea	013	012	The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.  His sin is stored up.
Hosea	013	013	The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.
Hosea	013	014	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.  I will redeem them
Hosea	013	015	Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come,
Hosea	013	016	Samaria will bear her guilt; for she has rebelled against her God.
Hosea	014	001	Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen because
Hosea	014	002	Take words with you, and return to Yahweh.  Tell him,
Hosea	014	003	Assyria can't save us.  We won't ride on horses; neither will
Hosea	014	004	"I will heal their waywardness.  I will love them freely;
Hosea	014	005	I will be like the dew to Israel.  He will blossom like the lily,
Hosea	014	006	His branches will spread, and his beauty will be like the olive tree,
Hosea	014	007	Men will dwell in his shade.  They will revive like the grain,
Hosea	014	008	Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols?  I answer,
Hosea	014	009	Who is wise, that he may understand these things?
Joel	001	001	The Word of Yahweh that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.
Joel	001	002	Hear this, you elders, And listen, all you inhabitants of the land.
Joel	001	003	Tell your children about it, and have your children tell
Joel	001	004	What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.
Joel	001	005	Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!  Wail, all you drinkers of wine,
Joel	001	006	For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.
Joel	001	007	He has laid my vine waste, and stripped my fig tree.
Joel	001	008	Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband
Joel	001	009	The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from
Joel	001	010	The field is laid waste.  The land mourns, for the grain
Joel	001	011	Be confounded, you farmers!  Wail, you vineyard keepers;
Joel	001	012	The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;
Joel	001	013	Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!  Wail, you ministers
Joel	001	014	Sanctify a fast.  Call a solemn assembly.  Gather the elders,
Joel	001	015	Alas for the day!  For the day of Yahweh is at hand, and it
Joel	001	016	Isn't the food cut off before our eyes; joy and gladness
Joel	001	017	The seeds rot under their clods.  The granaries are laid desolate.
Joel	001	018	How the animals groan!  The herds of livestock are perplexed,
Joel	001	019	Yahweh, I cry to you, For the fire has devoured the pastures
Joel	001	020	Yes, the animals of the field pant to you, for the water
Joel	002	001	Blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!
Joel	002	002	A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness.
Joel	002	003	A fire devours before them, and behind them, a flame burns.
Joel	002	004	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses,
Joel	002	005	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap,
Joel	002	006	At their presence the peoples are in anguish.  All faces
Joel	002	007	They run like mighty men.  They climb the wall like warriors.
Joel	002	008	Neither does one jostle another; they march everyone in his path,
Joel	002	009	They rush on the city.  They run on the wall.  They climb up
Joel	002	010	The earth quakes before them.  The heavens tremble.
Joel	002	011	Yahweh thunders his voice before his army; for his forces
Joel	002	012	"Yet even now," says Yahweh, "turn to me with all your heart,
Joel	002	013	Tear your heart, and not your garments, and turn to Yahweh,
Joel	002	014	Who knows?  He may turn and relent, and leave a blessing behind him,
Joel	002	015	Blow the trumpet in Zion!  Sanctify a fast.  Call a solemn assembly.
Joel	002	016	Gather the people.  Sanctify the assembly.  Assemble the elders.
Joel	002	017	Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch
Joel	002	018	Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, And had pity on his people.
Joel	002	019	Yahweh answered his people, "Behold, I will send you grain,
Joel	002	020	But I will remove the northern army far away from you,
Joel	002	021	Land, don't be afraid.  Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has
Joel	002	022	Don't be afraid, you animals of the field; for the pastures
Joel	002	023	"Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in Yahweh,
Joel	002	024	The threshing floors will be full of wheat, and the vats
Joel	002	025	I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,
Joel	002	026	You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied, and will praise
Joel	002	027	You will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
Joel	002	028	"It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on
Joel	002	029	And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,
Joel	002	030	I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
Joel	002	031	The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
Joel	002	032	It will happen that whoever will call on the name of Yahweh
Joel	003	001	"For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I restore
Joel	003	002	I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into
Joel	003	003	and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for
Joel	003	004	"Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,
Joel	003	005	Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
Joel	003	006	and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem
Joel	003	007	Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have
Joel	003	008	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands
Joel	003	009	Proclaim this among the nations:  "Prepare for war!
Joel	003	010	Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears.
Joel	003	011	Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather
Joel	003	012	"Let the nations arouse themselves, and come up to the valley
Joel	003	013	Put in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe.  Come, tread,
Joel	003	014	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!
Joel	003	015	The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars
Joel	003	016	Yahweh will roar from Zion, and thunder from Jerusalem;
Joel	003	017	"So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God, dwelling in Zion,
Joel	003	018	It will happen in that day, that the mountains will drop down
Joel	003	019	Egypt will be a desolation, and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
Joel	003	020	But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from
Joel	003	021	I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed:
Amos	001	001	The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa,
Amos	001	002	He said:  "Yahweh will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
Amos	001	003	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Damascus, yes,
Amos	001	004	but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it will
Amos	001	005	I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant
Amos	001	006	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four,
Amos	001	007	but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it will
Amos	001	008	I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him who holds
Amos	001	009	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Tyre, yes,
Amos	001	010	but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it will
Amos	001	011	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four,
Amos	001	012	but I will send a fire on Teman, and it will devour
Amos	001	013	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of the children
Amos	001	014	But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it will
Amos	001	015	and their king will go into captivity, he and his
Amos	002	001	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four,
Amos	002	002	but I will send a fire on Moab, and it will devour the palaces
Amos	002	003	and I will cut off the judge from their midst, and will kill
Amos	002	004	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four,
Amos	002	005	But I will send a fire on Judah, and it will devour
Amos	002	006	Thus says Yahweh:  "For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four,
Amos	002	007	They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
Amos	002	008	and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes
Amos	002	009	Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was
Amos	002	010	Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty
Amos	002	011	I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your
Amos	002	012	"But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded
Amos	002	013	Behold, I will crush you in your place, as a cart crushes
Amos	002	014	Flight will perish from the swift; and the strong won't strengthen
Amos	002	015	neither shall he stand who handles the bow; and he who is
Amos	002	016	and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked
Amos	003	001	Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of Israel,
Amos	003	002	"You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth.
Amos	003	003	Do two walk together, unless they have agreed?
Amos	003	004	Will a lion roar in the thicket, when he has no prey?
Amos	003	005	Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth, where no snare
Amos	003	006	Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city, without the people
Amos	003	007	Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, unless he reveals
Amos	003	008	The lion has roared.  Who will not fear?  The Lord Yahweh has spoken.
Amos	003	009	Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land
Amos	003	010	"Indeed they don't know to do right," says Yahweh, "Who hoard
Amos	003	011	Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "An adversary will
Amos	003	012	Thus says Yahweh:  "As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth
Amos	003	013	"Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,"
Amos	003	014	"For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel
Amos	003	015	I will strike the winter house with the summer house;
Amos	004	001	Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain
Amos	004	002	The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold, "The days
Amos	004	003	You will go out at the breaks in the wall, everyone straight
Amos	004	004	"Go to Bethel, and sin; to Gilgal, and sin more.  Bring your
Amos	004	005	offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,
Amos	004	006	"I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
Amos	004	007	"I also have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet
Amos	004	008	So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,
Amos	004	009	"I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens
Amos	004	010	"I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt.  I have slain your
Amos	004	011	"I have overthrown some of you, as when God overthrew Sodom
Amos	004	012	"Therefore thus will I do to you, Israel; because I will do
Amos	004	013	For, behold, he who forms the mountains, and creates
Amos	005	001	Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you,
Amos	005	002	"The virgin of Israel has fallen; She shall rise no more.
Amos	005	003	For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "The city that went forth
Amos	005	004	For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel:  "Seek me,
Amos	005	005	but don't seek Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and don't pass
Amos	005	006	Seek Yahweh, and you will live; lest he break out like fire
Amos	005	007	You who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness
Amos	005	008	seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow
Amos	005	009	who brings sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction
Amos	005	010	They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him
Amos	005	011	Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor, and take taxes
Amos	005	012	For I know how many your offenses, and how great are your sins--
Amos	005	013	Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,
Amos	005	014	Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so Yahweh,
Amos	005	015	Hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the courts.
Amos	005	016	Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies,
Amos	005	017	In all vineyards there will be wailing; for I will pass through
Amos	005	018	"Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!  Why do you long
Amos	005	019	As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him;
Amos	005	020	Won't the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?
Amos	005	021	I hate, I despise your feasts, and I can't stand
Amos	005	022	Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,
Amos	005	023	Take away from me the noise of your songs!  I will not listen
Amos	005	024	But let justice roll on like rivers, and righteousness like
Amos	005	025	"Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness
Amos	005	026	You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images,
Amos	005	027	Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,"
Amos	006	001	Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who are secure
Amos	006	002	Go to Calneh, and see; and from there go to Hamath the great;
Amos	006	003	Those who put far away the evil day, and cause the seat
Amos	006	004	Who lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches,
Amos	006	005	who strum on the strings of a harp; who invent for themselves
Amos	006	006	who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best oils;
Amos	006	007	Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive;
Amos	006	008	"The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself," says Yahweh, the God
Amos	006	009	It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house,
Amos	006	010	"When a man's relative carries him, even he who burns him,
Amos	006	011	"For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be
Amos	006	012	Do horses run on the rocky crags?  Does one plow there with oxen?
Amos	006	013	you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, 'Haven't we
Amos	006	014	For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,"
Amos	007	001	Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me:  and behold, he formed locusts
Amos	007	002	It happened that, when they made an end of eating the grass
Amos	007	003	Yahweh relented concerning this.  "It shall not be," says Yahweh.
Amos	007	004	Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh
Amos	007	005	Then I said, "Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you!  How could Jacob stand?
Amos	007	006	Yahweh relented concerning this.  "This also shall not be,"
Amos	007	007	Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall
Amos	007	008	Yahweh said to me, "Amos, what do you see?"  I said, "A plumb line."
Amos	007	009	The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries
Amos	007	010	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king
Amos	007	011	For Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel
Amos	007	012	Amaziah also said to Amos, "You seer, go, flee away into the land
Amos	007	013	but don't prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is
Amos	007	014	Then Amos answered Amaziah, "I was no prophet, neither was
Amos	007	015	and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said
Amos	007	016	Now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh:  'You say,
Amos	007	017	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  'Your wife shall be a prostitute
Amos	008	001	Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me:  behold, a basket of summer fruit.
Amos	008	002	He said, "Amos, what do you see?"  I said, "A basket of
Amos	008	003	The songs of the temple will be wailings in that day,"
Amos	008	004	Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy, and cause
Amos	008	005	Saying, 'When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?
Amos	008	006	that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
Amos	008	007	Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob, "Surely I will never
Amos	008	008	Won't the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn who dwells
Amos	008	009	It will happen in that day," says the Lord Yahweh, "that I
Amos	008	010	I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs
Amos	008	011	Behold, the days come," says the Lord Yahweh, "that I will send
Amos	008	012	They will wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east;

Amos	009	002	Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them;
Amos	009	003	Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search
Amos	009	004	Though they go into captivity before their enemies,
Amos	009	005	For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land
Amos	009	006	It is he who builds his chambers in the heavens, and has
Amos	009	007	Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me,
Amos	009	008	Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom,
Amos	009	009	"For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of
Amos	009	010	All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say,
Amos	009	011	In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen,
Amos	009	012	that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations
Amos	009	013	"Behold, the days come," says Yahweh, "that the plowman

Jonah	001	001	Now the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
Jonah	001	002	"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it,
Jonah	001	003	But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Yahweh.
Jonah	001	004	But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea, and there
Jonah	001	005	Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god.
Jonah	001	006	So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, "What do
Jonah	001	007	They all said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots,
Jonah	001	008	Then they asked him, "Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil
Jonah	001	009	He said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God
Jonah	001	010	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, "What is
Jonah	001	011	Then said they to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea
Jonah	001	012	He said to them, "Take me up, and throw me into the sea.
Jonah	001	013	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land;
Jonah	001	014	Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, "We beg you,
Jonah	001	015	So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea
Jonah	001	016	Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered
Jonah	001	017	Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah
Jonah	002	001	Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish's belly.
Jonah	002	002	He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
Jonah	002	003	For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas.
Jonah	002	004	I said, 'I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look
Jonah	002	005	The waters surrounded me, even to the soul.  The deep was around me.
Jonah	002	006	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.  The earth barred
Jonah	002	007	"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.
Jonah	002	008	Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
Jonah	002	009	But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
Jonah	002	010	Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
Jonah	003	001	The word of Yahweh came to Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah	003	002	"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it
Jonah	003	003	So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word
Jonah	003	004	Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried out,
Jonah	003	005	The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast,
Jonah	003	006	The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
Jonah	003	007	He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the
Jonah	003	008	but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal,
Jonah	003	009	Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away
Jonah	003	010	God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way.
Jonah	004	001	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
Jonah	004	002	He prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Please, Yahweh, wasn't this what I
Jonah	004	003	Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me;
Jonah	004	004	Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
Jonah	004	005	Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city,
Jonah	004	006	Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah,
Jonah	004	007	But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed
Jonah	004	008	It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry
Jonah	004	009	God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?"
Jonah	004	010	Yahweh said, "You have been concerned for the vine,
Jonah	004	011	Shouldn't I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city,
Micah	001	001	The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days
Micah	001	002	Hear, you peoples, all of you.  Listen, O earth, and all that
Micah	001	003	For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place, and will come
Micah	001	004	The mountains melt under him, and the valleys split apart,
Micah	001	005	"All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins
Micah	001	006	Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,
Micah	001	007	All her idols will be beaten to pieces, and all her temple gifts
Micah	001	008	For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked;
Micah	001	009	For her wounds are incurable; for it has come even to Judah.
Micah	001	010	Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't weep at all.  At Beth Ophrah{Beth Ophrah
Micah	001	011	Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
Micah	001	012	For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,

Micah	001	014	Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.
Micah	001	015	I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah.

Micah	002	002	They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away:
Micah	002	003	Therefore thus says Yahweh:  "Behold, I am planning against these
Micah	002	004	In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament

Habakkuk	001	001	The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk	001	002	Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear?
Habakkuk	001	003	Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity?
Habakkuk	001	004	Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth;

Habakkuk	003	013	You went forth for the salvation of your people, for the salvation
Habakkuk	003	014	You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.
Habakkuk	003	015	You trampled the sea with your horses, churning mighty waters.
Habakkuk	003	016	I heard, and my body trembled.  My lips quivered at the voice.
Habakkuk	003	017	For though the fig tree doesn't flourish, nor fruit be in the vines;
Habakkuk	003	018	yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.  I will be joyful in the God

Zephaniah	003	003	Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions.
Zephaniah	003	004	Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people.
Zephaniah	003	005	Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous.  He will do no wrong.

Zechariah	001	021	Then I asked, "What are these coming to do?"  He said,
Zechariah	002	001	I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring

Malachi	001	001	An oracle:  the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.
Malachi	001	002	"I have loved you," says Yahweh.  Yet you say,

Matthew	003	002	"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
Matthew	003	003	For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew	003	004	Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair,
Matthew	003	005	Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region
Matthew	003	006	They were baptized{or, immersed} by him in the Jordan,
Matthew	003	007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming
Matthew	003	008	Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
Matthew	003	009	Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,'
Matthew	003	010	"Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees.

Matthew	004	023	Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
Matthew	004	024	The report about him went out into all Syria.  They brought
Matthew	004	025	Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and
Matthew	005	001	Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain.
Matthew	005	002	He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
Matthew	005	003	"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom

Matthew	012	013	Then he told the man, "Stretch out your hand."  He stretched it out;
Matthew	012	014	But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him,
Matthew	012	015	Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there.  Great multitudes
Matthew	012	016	and charged them that they should not make him known:
Matthew	012	017	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah
Matthew	012	018	"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom
Matthew	012	019	He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his
Matthew	012	020	He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a smoking flax,
Matthew	012	021	In his name, the nations will hope."{Isaiah 42:1-4}
Matthew	012	022	Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought
Matthew	012	023	All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be
Matthew	012	024	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This man does not cast
Matthew	012	025	Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom
Matthew	012	026	If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself.
Matthew	012	027	If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children
Matthew	012	028	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom
Matthew	012	029	Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man,
Matthew	012	030	"He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn't gather
Matthew	012	031	Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men,
Matthew	012	032	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be
Matthew	012	033	"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make
Matthew	012	034	You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?
Matthew	012	035	The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things,
Matthew	012	036	I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give
Matthew	012	037	For by your words you will be justified, and by your words
Matthew	012	038	Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, "Teacher,
Matthew	012	039	But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks
Matthew	012	040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly
Matthew	012	041	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation,
Matthew	012	042	The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment
Matthew	012	043	But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man,
Matthew	012	044	Then he says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,'
Matthew	012	045	Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits
Matthew	012	046	While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother
Matthew	012	047	One said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers
Matthew	012	048	But he answered him who spoke to him, "Who is my mother?
Matthew	012	049	He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said,
Matthew	012	050	For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven,
Matthew	013	001	On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
Matthew	013	002	Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat,
Matthew	013	003	He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold,
Matthew	013	004	As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds
Matthew	013	005	Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil,
Matthew	013	006	When the sun had risen, they were scorched.  Because they
Matthew	013	007	Others fell among thorns.  The thorns grew up and choked them:
Matthew	013	008	and others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit:
Matthew	013	009	He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
Matthew	013	010	The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak
Matthew	013	011	He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries
Matthew	013	012	For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance,
Matthew	013	013	Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see,
Matthew	013	014	In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,
Matthew	013	015	for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull
Matthew	013	016	"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears,
Matthew	013	017	For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men
Matthew	013	018	"Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
Matthew	013	019	When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it,
Matthew	013	020	What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word,
Matthew	013	021	yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while.
Matthew	013	022	What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word,
Matthew	013	023	What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word,
Matthew	013	024	He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom
Matthew	013	025	but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds{darnel
Matthew	013	026	But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit,
Matthew	013	027	The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir,
Matthew	013	028	"He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'  "The servants
Matthew	013	029	"But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds,
Matthew	013	030	Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time
Matthew	013	031	He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom
Matthew	013	032	which indeed is smaller than all seeds.  But when it is grown,
Matthew	013	033	He spoke another parable to them.  "The Kingdom of Heaven is
Matthew	013	034	Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes;
Matthew	013	035	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet,
Matthew	013	036	Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house.
Matthew	013	037	He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
Matthew	013	038	the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children
Matthew	013	039	The enemy who sowed them is the devil.  The harvest is the end
Matthew	013	040	As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire;
Matthew	013	041	The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will
Matthew	013	042	and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be
Matthew	013	043	Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom
Matthew	013	044	"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden
Matthew	013	045	"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant
Matthew	013	046	who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold
Matthew	013	047	"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast
Matthew	013	048	which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach.
Matthew	013	049	So will it be in the end of the world.  The angels will come forth,
Matthew	013	050	and will cast them into the furnace of fire.  There will be
Matthew	013	051	Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?"
Matthew	013	052	He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple
Matthew	013	053	It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables,
Matthew	013	054	Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue,
Matthew	013	055	Isn't this the carpenter's son?  Isn't his mother called Mary,
Matthew	013	056	Aren't all of his sisters with us?  Where then did this man
Matthew	013	057	They were offended by him.  But Jesus said to them,
Matthew	013	058	He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew	014	001	At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
Matthew	014	002	and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer.
Matthew	014	003	For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him
Matthew	014	004	For John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Matthew	014	005	When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
Matthew	014	006	But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced
Matthew	014	007	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever
Matthew	014	008	She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on
Matthew	014	009	The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths,
Matthew	014	010	and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew	014	011	His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady:
Matthew	014	012	His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it;
Matthew	014	013	Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat,
Matthew	014	014	Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude.  He had compassion
Matthew	014	015	When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying,
Matthew	014	016	But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away.
Matthew	014	017	They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."
Matthew	014	018	He said, "Bring them here to me."
Matthew	014	019	He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took
Matthew	014	020	They all ate, and were filled.  They took up twelve baskets
Matthew	014	021	Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women
Matthew	014	022	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat,
Matthew	014	023	After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into
Matthew	014	024	But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by
Matthew	014	025	In the fourth watch of the night,{The night was equally divided
Matthew	014	026	When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled,
Matthew	014	027	But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up!
Matthew	014	028	Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me
Matthew	014	029	He said, "Come!"  Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked
Matthew	014	030	But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid,
Matthew	014	031	Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him,
Matthew	014	032	When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Matthew	014	033	Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying,
Matthew	014	034	When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
Matthew	014	035	When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all
Matthew	014	036	and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe{or,
Matthew	015	001	Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew	015	002	"Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders?
Matthew	015	003	He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment
Matthew	015	004	For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,'{Exodus 20:12;
Matthew	015	005	But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother,
Matthew	015	006	he shall not honor his father or mother.'  You have made
Matthew	015	007	You hypocrites!  Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
Matthew	015	008	'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me
Matthew	015	009	And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules
Matthew	015	010	He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.
Matthew	015	011	That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the man;
Matthew	015	012	Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that
Matthew	015	013	But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn't
Matthew	015	014	Leave them alone.  They are blind guides of the blind.
Matthew	015	015	Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."
Matthew	015	016	So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?
Matthew	015	017	Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes
Matthew	015	018	But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart,
Matthew	015	019	For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
Matthew	015	020	These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with
Matthew	015	021	Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region
Matthew	015	022	Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders,
Matthew	015	023	But he answered her not a word.  His disciples came and
Matthew	015	024	But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep
Matthew	015	025	But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."
Matthew	015	026	But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's
Matthew	015	027	But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs
Matthew	015	028	Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith!
Matthew	015	029	Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee;
Matthew	015	030	Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind,
Matthew	015	031	so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking,
Matthew	015	032	Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on
Matthew	015	033	The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves
Matthew	015	034	Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"
Matthew	015	035	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
Matthew	015	036	and he took the seven loaves and the fish.  He gave thanks
Matthew	015	037	They all ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets
Matthew	015	038	Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew	015	039	Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came
Matthew	016	001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him
Matthew	016	002	But he answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will

Matthew	016	005	The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten
Matthew	016	006	Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast
Matthew	016	007	They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
Matthew	016	008	Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves,
Matthew	016	009	Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves
Matthew	016	010	Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets
Matthew	016	011	How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak
Matthew	016	012	Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of the yeast
Matthew	016	013	Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi,
Matthew	016	014	They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others,
Matthew	016	015	He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Matthew	016	016	Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of
Matthew	016	017	Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah,
Matthew	016	018	I also tell you that you are Peter,{Peter's name, Petros in Greek,
Matthew	016	019	I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever
Matthew	016	020	Then he charged the disciples that they should tell no one
Matthew	016	021	From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must

Matthew	016	023	But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan!  You are

Matthew	016	028	Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who
Matthew	017	001	After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John
Matthew	017	002	He was transfigured before them.  His face shone like the sun,
Matthew	017	003	Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
Matthew	017	004	Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us
Matthew	017	005	While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
Matthew	017	006	When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces,
Matthew	017	007	Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
Matthew	017	008	Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
Matthew	017	009	As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
Matthew	017	010	His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say
Matthew	017	011	Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will
Matthew	017	012	but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't
Matthew	017	013	Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of
Matthew	017	014	When they came to the multitude, a man came to him,
Matthew	017	015	"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic,
Matthew	017	016	So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."
Matthew	017	017	Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation!
Matthew	017	018	Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy
Matthew	017	019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said,
Matthew	017	020	He said to them, "Because of your unbelief.  For most certainly
Matthew	017	021	But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."
Matthew	017	022	While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son
Matthew	017	023	and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up."
Matthew	017	024	When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma
Matthew	017	025	He said, "Yes." When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him,
Matthew	017	026	Peter said to him, "From strangers."  Jesus said to him,
Matthew	017	027	But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea,
Matthew	018	001	In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then
Matthew	018	002	Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the
Matthew	018	003	and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn,
Matthew	018	004	Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child,
Matthew	018	005	Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
Matthew	018	006	but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me

Matthew	018	008	If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off,
Matthew	018	009	If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast
Matthew	018	010	See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I
Matthew	018	011	For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
Matthew	018	012	"What do you think?  If a man has one hundred sheep,
Matthew	018	013	If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it
Matthew	018	014	Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven
Matthew	018	015	"If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault
Matthew	018	016	But if he doesn't listen, take one or two more with you,
Matthew	018	017	If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly.
Matthew	018	018	Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth
Matthew	018	019	Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree
Matthew	018	020	For where two or three are gathered together in my name,

Matthew	018	023	Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king,

Matthew	018	026	The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him,

Matthew	018	028	"But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants,
Matthew	018	029	"So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him,
Matthew	018	030	He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should
Matthew	018	031	So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were
Matthew	018	032	Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant!
Matthew	018	033	Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant,
Matthew	018	034	His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors,
Matthew	018	035	So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each
Matthew	019	001	It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed
Matthew	019	002	Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
Matthew	019	003	Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful
Matthew	019	004	He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from

Matthew	019	007	They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her

Matthew	019	016	Behold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good thing
Matthew	019	017	He said to him, "Why do you call me good?  No one is good

Matthew	019	019	'Honor your father and mother.'{Exodus 20:12-16;
Matthew	019	020	The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed

Matthew	019	023	Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you,
Matthew	019	024	Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through
Matthew	019	025	When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished,
Matthew	019	026	Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible,

Matthew	020	027	Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,

Matthew	020	030	Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard
Matthew	020	031	The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet,

Matthew	021	002	saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite you,

Matthew	021	006	The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
Matthew	021	007	and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them;

Matthew	021	009	The multitudes who went before him, and who followed

Matthew	021	017	He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany,
Matthew	021	018	Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
Matthew	021	019	Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing
Matthew	021	020	When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did

Matthew	021	022	All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
Matthew	021	023	When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and
Matthew	021	024	Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question,
Matthew	021	025	The baptism of John, where was it from?  From heaven or from men?"
Matthew	021	026	But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold

Matthew	021	030	He came to the second, and said the same thing.  He answered,

Matthew	021	046	When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes,
Matthew	022	001	Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
Matthew	022	002	"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made
Matthew	022	003	and sent out his servants to call those who were invited
Matthew	022	004	Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those

Matthew	022	013	Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot,
Matthew	022	014	For many are called, but few chosen."
Matthew	022	015	Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap
Matthew	022	016	They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians,
Matthew	022	017	Tell us therefore, what do you think?  Is it lawful to pay
Matthew	022	018	But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you
Matthew	022	019	Show me the tax money."  They brought to him a denarius.
Matthew	022	020	He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
Matthew	022	021	They said to him, "Caesar's." Then he said to them,
Matthew	022	022	When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.
Matthew	022	023	On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection)

Matthew	022	026	In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
Matthew	022	027	After them all, the woman died.
Matthew	022	028	In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven?
Matthew	022	029	But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing
Matthew	022	030	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given

Matthew	022	033	When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
Matthew	022	034	But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced
Matthew	022	035	One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.
Matthew	022	036	"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Matthew	022	037	Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God
Matthew	022	038	This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew	022	039	A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor
Matthew	022	040	The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."
Matthew	022	041	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
Matthew	022	042	saying, "What do you think of the Christ?  Whose son is he?"
Matthew	022	043	He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call
Matthew	022	044	'The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make
Matthew	022	045	"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
Matthew	022	046	No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare
Matthew	023	001	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
Matthew	023	002	saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
Matthew	023	003	All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe,
Matthew	023	004	For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne,
Matthew	023	005	But all their works they do to be seen by men.

Matthew	024	010	Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another,

Matthew	024	019	But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers

Matthew	026	073	After a little while those who stood by came and said
Matthew	026	074	Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"
Matthew	026	075	Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him,
Matthew	027	001	Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders
Matthew	027	002	and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up
Matthew	027	003	Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned,
Matthew	027	004	saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."
Matthew	027	005	He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed.
Matthew	027	006	The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said,
Matthew	027	007	They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them,
Matthew	027	008	Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood"
Matthew	027	009	Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah{some manuscripts
Matthew	027	010	and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded
Matthew	027	011	Now Jesus stood before the governor:  and the governor asked him,
Matthew	027	012	When he was accused by the chief priests and elders,
Matthew	027	013	Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how many things they
Matthew	027	014	He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the
Matthew	027	015	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release
Matthew	027	016	They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew	027	017	When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them,
Matthew	027	018	For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
Matthew	027	019	While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent
Matthew	027	020	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes
Matthew	027	021	But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want
Matthew	027	022	Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is
Matthew	027	023	But the governor said, "Why?  What evil has he done?"
Matthew	027	024	So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained,
Matthew	027	025	All the people answered, "May his blood be on us,
Matthew	027	026	Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged
Matthew	027	027	Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium,
Matthew	027	028	They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
Matthew	027	029	They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head,
Matthew	027	030	They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
Matthew	027	031	When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him,
Matthew	027	032	As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name,
Matthew	027	033	They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say,
Matthew	027	034	They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall.
Matthew	027	035	When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them,
Matthew	027	036	and they sat and watched him there.
Matthew	027	037	They set up over his head the accusation against him written,
Matthew	027	038	Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his
Matthew	027	039	Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
Matthew	027	040	and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it
Matthew	027	041	Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes,
Matthew	027	042	"He saved others, but he can't save himself.  If he is
Matthew	027	043	He trusts in God.  Let God deliver him now, if he wants him;
Matthew	027	044	The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him
Matthew	027	045	Now from the sixth hour{noon} there was darkness over all
Matthew	027	046	About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Matthew	027	047	Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man
Matthew	027	048	Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it
Matthew	027	049	The rest said, "Let him be.  Let's see whether Elijah comes
Matthew	027	050	Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew	027	051	Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top
Matthew	027	052	The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had
Matthew	027	053	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered
Matthew	027	054	Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,
Matthew	027	055	Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed
Matthew	027	056	Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses,
Matthew	027	057	When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph,
Matthew	027	058	This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.  Then Pilate
Matthew	027	059	Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew	027	060	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock,
Matthew	027	061	Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting
Matthew	027	062	Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day,
Matthew	027	063	saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was
Matthew	027	064	Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day,
Matthew	027	065	Pilate said to them, "You have a guard.  Go, make it as secure
Matthew	027	066	So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure,
Matthew	028	001	Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first
Matthew	028	002	Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord
Matthew	028	003	His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
Matthew	028	004	For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
Matthew	028	005	The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know
Matthew	028	006	He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said.
Matthew	028	007	Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead,
Matthew	028	008	They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy,
Matthew	028	009	As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
Matthew	028	010	Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid.  Go tell my
Matthew	028	011	Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came
Matthew	028	012	When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel,
Matthew	028	013	saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him
Matthew	028	014	If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him
Matthew	028	015	So they took the money and did as they were told.
Matthew	028	016	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain
Matthew	028	017	When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
Matthew	028	018	Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority
Matthew	028	019	Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
Matthew	028	020	teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you.
Mark	001	001	The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mark	001	002	As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger
Mark	001	003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way
Mark	001	004	John came baptizing{or, immersing} in the wilderness and preaching
Mark	001	005	All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went
Mark	001	006	John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around
Mark	001	007	He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier
Mark	001	008	I baptized you in{The Greek word (en) translated here as "in"
Mark	001	009	It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth
Mark	001	010	Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting,
Mark	001	011	A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom
Mark	001	012	Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
Mark	001	013	He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan.
Mark	001	014	Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee,
Mark	001	015	and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
Mark	001	016	Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
Mark	001	017	Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into
Mark	001	018	Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
Mark	001	019	Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son
Mark	001	020	Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee,
Mark	001	021	They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day
Mark	001	022	They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them
Mark	001	023	Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark	001	024	saying, "Ha!  What do we have to do with you, Jesus,
Mark	001	025	Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
Mark	001	026	The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice,
Mark	001	027	They were all amazed, so that they questioned among
Mark	001	028	The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all
Mark	001	029	Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came
Mark	001	030	Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately
Mark	001	031	He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up.
Mark	001	032	At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all
Mark	001	033	All the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark	001	034	He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast
Mark	001	035	Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose
Mark	001	036	Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
Mark	001	037	and they found him, and told him, "Everyone is looking for you."
Mark	001	038	He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I
Mark	001	039	He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
Mark	001	040	A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him,
Mark	001	041	Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand,
Mark	001	042	When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him,
Mark	001	043	He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
Mark	001	044	and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show
Mark	001	045	But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread
Mark	002	001	When he entered again into Capernaum after some days,
Mark	002	002	Immediately many were gathered together, so that there
Mark	002	003	Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.
Mark	002	004	When they could not come near to him for the crowd,
Mark	002	005	Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins
Mark	002	006	But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
Mark	002	007	"Why does this man speak blasphemies like that?
Mark	002	008	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so
Mark	002	009	Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;'
Mark	002	010	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth
Mark	002	011	"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
Mark	002	012	He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went
Mark	002	013	He went out again by the seaside.  All the multitude came to him,
Mark	002	014	As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus,
Mark	002	015	It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house,
Mark	002	016	The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating
Mark	002	017	When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy
Mark	002	018	John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came
Mark	002	019	Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom
Mark	002	020	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away
Mark	002	021	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment,
Mark	002	022	No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine
Mark	002	023	It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through
Mark	002	024	The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which
Mark	002	025	He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need,
Mark	002	026	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest,
Mark	002	027	He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man
Mark	002	028	Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Mark	003	001	He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there
Mark	003	002	They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day,
Mark	003	003	He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."
Mark	003	004	He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to
Mark	003	005	When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved
Mark	003	006	The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the
Mark	003	007	Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great
Mark	003	008	from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from
Mark	003	009	He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near
Mark	003	010	For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed
Mark	003	011	The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him,
Mark	003	012	He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
Mark	003	013	He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom
Mark	003	014	He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that
Mark	003	015	and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
Mark	003	016	Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;
Mark	003	017	James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James,
Mark	003	018	Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son
Mark	003	019	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  He came into a house.
Mark	003	020	The multitude came together again, so that they could not
Mark	003	021	When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him:
Mark	003	022	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul,"
Mark	003	023	He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan
Mark	003	024	If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark	003	025	If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
Mark	003	026	If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided,
Mark	003	027	But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder,
Mark	003	028	Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man
Mark	003	029	but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never
Mark	003	030	--because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."
Mark	003	031	His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside,
Mark	003	032	A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold,
Mark	003	033	He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
Mark	003	034	Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold,
Mark	003	035	For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother,
Mark	004	001	Again he began to teach by the seaside.  A great multitude was
Mark	004	002	He taught them many things in parables, and told them
Mark	004	003	"Listen!  Behold, the farmer went out to sow,
Mark	004	004	and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road,
Mark	004	005	Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil,
Mark	004	006	When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had
Mark	004	007	Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up,
Mark	004	008	Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit,
Mark	004	009	He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark	004	010	When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve
Mark	004	011	He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God,
Mark	004	012	that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
Mark	004	013	He said to them, "Don't you understand this parable?
Mark	004	014	The farmer sows the word.
Mark	004	015	The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown;
Mark	004	016	These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places,
Mark	004	017	They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When
Mark	004	018	Others are those who are sown among the thorns.
Mark	004	019	and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches,
Mark	004	020	Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear
Mark	004	021	He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under
Mark	004	022	For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known;
Mark	004	023	If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark	004	024	He said to them, "Take heed what you hear.  With whatever
Mark	004	025	For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have,
Mark	004	026	He said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed
Mark	004	027	and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should
Mark	004	028	For the earth bears fruit:  first the blade, then the ear,
Mark	004	029	But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle,
Mark	004	030	He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God?  Or with what
Mark	004	031	It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown
Mark	004	032	yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all
Mark	004	033	With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they
Mark	004	034	Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately
Mark	004	035	On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go
Mark	004	036	Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was,
Mark	004	037	A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat,
Mark	004	038	He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion,
Mark	004	039	He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace!
Mark	004	040	He said to them, "Why are you so afraid?  How is it that you
Mark	004	041	They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then
Mark	005	001	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country
Mark	005	002	When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him
Mark	005	003	who had his dwelling in the tombs.  Nobody could bind him any more,
Mark	005	004	because he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
Mark	005	005	Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains,
Mark	005	006	When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
Mark	005	007	and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do
Mark	005	008	For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
Mark	005	009	He asked him, "What is your name?"  He said to him, "My name
Mark	005	010	He begged him much that he would not send them away out
Mark	005	011	Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding.
Mark	005	012	All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs,
Mark	005	013	At once Jesus gave them permission.  The unclean spirits came
Mark	005	014	Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
Mark	005	015	They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed
Mark	005	016	Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him
Mark	005	017	They began to beg him to depart from their region.
Mark	005	018	As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed
Mark	005	019	He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house,
Mark	005	020	He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus
Mark	005	021	When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side,
Mark	005	022	Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came;
Mark	005	023	and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at
Mark	005	024	He went with him, and a great multitude followed him,
Mark	005	025	A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
Mark	005	026	and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent
Mark	005	027	having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him
Mark	005	028	For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."
Mark	005	029	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt
Mark	005	030	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had
Mark	005	031	His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing
Mark	005	032	He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
Mark	005	033	But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been
Mark	005	034	He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well.
Mark	005	035	While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue
Mark	005	036	But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said
Mark	005	037	He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John
Mark	005	038	He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar,
Mark	005	039	When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make
Mark	005	040	They ridiculed him.  But he, having put them all out,
Mark	005	041	Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi;"
Mark	005	042	Immediately the girl rose up, and walked, for she was twelve
Mark	005	043	He strictly ordered them that no one should know this,
Mark	006	001	He went out from there.  He came into his own country,
Mark	006	002	When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue,
Mark	006	003	Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of
Mark	006	004	Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor,
Mark	006	005	He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands
Mark	006	006	He marveled because of their unbelief.  He went around
Mark	006	007	He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two
Mark	006	008	He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey,
Mark	006	009	but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.
Mark	006	010	He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there
Mark	006	011	Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart
Mark	006	012	They went out and preached that people should repent.
Mark	006	013	They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick,
Mark	006	014	King Herod heard this, for his name had become known,
Mark	006	015	But others said, "It is Elijah."  Others said, "It is the Prophet,
Mark	006	016	But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded.
Mark	006	017	For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him
Mark	006	018	For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have
Mark	006	019	Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him,
Mark	006	020	for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man,
Mark	006	021	Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made
Mark	006	022	When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced,
Mark	006	023	He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you,
Mark	006	024	She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"
Mark	006	025	She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked,
Mark	006	026	The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths,
Mark	006	027	Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard,
Mark	006	028	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady;
Mark	006	029	When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse,
Mark	006	030	The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they
Mark	006	031	He said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place,
Mark	006	032	They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
Mark	006	033	They{TR reads "The multitudes" instead of "They"} saw them going,
Mark	006	034	Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion
Mark	006	035	When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said,
Mark	006	036	Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country
Mark	006	037	But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."
Mark	006	038	He said to them, "How many loaves do you have?  Go see."
Mark	006	039	He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups
Mark	006	040	They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
Mark	006	041	He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven,
Mark	006	042	They all ate, and were filled.
Mark	006	043	They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also
Mark	006	044	Those who ate the loaves were{TR adds "about"} five thousand men.
Mark	006	045	Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go
Mark	006	046	After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.
Mark	006	047	When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea,
Mark	006	048	Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary
Mark	006	049	but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it
Mark	006	050	for they all saw him, and were troubled.  But he immediately
Mark	006	051	He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they
Mark	006	052	for they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their
Mark	006	053	When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret,
Mark	006	054	When they had come out of the boat, immediately the
Mark	006	055	and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those
Mark	006	056	Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities,
Mark	007	001	Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together
Mark	007	002	Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled,
Mark	007	003	(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they
Mark	007	004	They don't eat when they come from the marketplace,
Mark	007	005	The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don't your
Mark	007	006	He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,
Mark	007	007	But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines
Mark	007	008	"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly
Mark	007	009	He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God,
Mark	007	010	For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;'{Exodus 20:12;
Mark	007	011	But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother,
Mark	007	012	then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father
Mark	007	013	making void the word of God by your tradition, which you
Mark	007	014	He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,
Mark	007	015	There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him
Mark	007	016	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"
Mark	007	017	When he had entered into a house away from the multitude,
Mark	007	018	He said to them, "Are you thus without understanding also?
Mark	007	019	because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach,
Mark	007	020	He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
Mark	007	021	For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts,
Mark	007	022	covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye,
Mark	007	023	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
Mark	007	024	From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre
Mark	007	025	For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit,
Mark	007	026	Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race.
Mark	007	027	But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first,
Mark	007	028	But she answered him, "Yes, Lord.  Yet even the dogs under
Mark	007	029	He said to her, "For this saying, go your way.  The demon has
Mark	007	030	She went away to her house, and found the child having been
Mark	007	031	Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
Mark	007	032	They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment
Mark	007	033	He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his
Mark	007	034	Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!"
Mark	007	035	Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his
Mark	007	036	He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more
Mark	007	037	They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all
Mark	008	001	In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they
Mark	008	002	"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed
Mark	008	003	If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint
Mark	008	004	His disciples answered him, "From where could one satisfy
Mark	008	005	He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"  They said, "Seven."
Mark	008	006	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground,
Mark	008	007	They had a few small fish.  Having blessed them, he said
Mark	008	008	They ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets of broken
Mark	008	009	Those who had eaten were about four thousand.
Mark	008	010	Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples,
Mark	008	011	The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from
Mark	008	012	He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this
Mark	008	013	He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to
Mark	008	014	They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one
Mark	008	015	He charged them, saying, "Take heed:  beware of the yeast
Mark	008	016	They reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we
Mark	008	017	Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that
Mark	008	018	Having eyes, don't you see?  Having ears, don't you hear?
Mark	008	019	When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand,
Mark	008	020	"When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many
Mark	008	021	He asked them, "Don't you understand, yet?"
Mark	008	022	He came to Bethsaida.  They brought a blind man to him,
Mark	008	023	He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him
Mark	008	024	He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them
Mark	008	025	Then again he laid his hands on his eyes.  He looked intently,
Mark	008	026	He sent him away to his house, saying, "Don't enter into
Mark	008	027	Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages
Mark	008	028	They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others:
Mark	008	029	He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Mark	008	030	He charged them that they should tell no one about him.
Mark	008	031	He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things,
Mark	008	032	He spoke to them openly.  Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark	008	033	But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter,
Mark	008	034	He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said
Mark	008	035	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever
Mark	008	036	For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world,
Mark	008	037	For what will a man give in exchange for his life?
Mark	008	038	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this
Mark	009	001	He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there are some
Mark	009	002	After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John,
Mark	009	003	His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow,
Mark	009	004	Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark	009	005	Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.
Mark	009	006	For he didn't know what to say, for they were very afraid.
Mark	009	007	A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud,
Mark	009	008	Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more,
Mark	009	009	As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them
Mark	009	010	They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the "rising
Mark	009	011	They asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah
Mark	009	012	He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things.
Mark	009	013	But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done
Mark	009	014	Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them,
Mark	009	015	Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed,
Mark	009	016	He asked the scribes, "What are you asking them?"
Mark	009	017	One of the multitude answered, "Teacher, I brought to you my son,
Mark	009	018	and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams
Mark	009	019	He answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long
Mark	009	020	They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit
Mark	009	021	He asked his father, "How long has it been since this has come
Mark	009	022	Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water,
Mark	009	023	Jesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are possible
Mark	009	024	Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, "I believe.
Mark	009	025	When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked
Mark	009	026	Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him.
Mark	009	027	But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
Mark	009	028	When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately,
Mark	009	029	He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing,
Mark	009	030	They went out from there, and passed through Galilee.
Mark	009	031	For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them,
Mark	009	032	But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid
Mark	009	033	He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them,
Mark	009	034	But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another
Mark	009	035	He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them,
Mark	009	036	He took a little child, and set him in the midst of them.
Mark	009	037	"Whoever receives one such little child in my name,
Mark	009	038	John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow
Mark	009	039	But Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will
Mark	009	040	For whoever is not against us is on our side.
Mark	009	041	For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name,

Mark	009	045	If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off.
Mark	009	046	'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'

Mark	009	049	For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
Mark	009	050	Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness,
Mark	010	001	He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and
Mark	010	002	Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, "Is it lawful
Mark	010	003	He answered, "What did Moses command you?"
Mark	010	004	They said, "Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written,
Mark	010	005	But Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart, he wrote
Mark	010	006	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male
Mark	010	007	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother,
Mark	010	008	and the two will become one flesh,{Genesis 2:24} so that they
Mark	010	009	What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
Mark	010	010	In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.
Mark	010	011	He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another,
Mark	010	012	If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another,
Mark	010	013	They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them,
Mark	010	014	But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation,
Mark	010	015	Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom
Mark	010	016	He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his
Mark	010	017	As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him,
Mark	010	018	Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good?  No one is good
Mark	010	019	You know the commandments:  'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,'
Mark	010	020	He said to him, "Teacher, I have observed all these things
Mark	010	021	Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, "One thing
Mark	010	022	But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful,
Mark	010	023	Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, "How difficult it
Mark	010	024	The disciples were amazed at his words.  But Jesus answered again,
Mark	010	025	It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than
Mark	010	026	They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, "Then who
Mark	010	027	Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible,
Mark	010	028	Peter began to tell him, "Behold, we have left all,
Mark	010	029	Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has
Mark	010	030	but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time,
Mark	010	031	But many who are first will be last; and the last first."
Mark	010	032	They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going
Mark	010	033	"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.  The Son of Man
Mark	010	034	They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him.
Mark	010	035	James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him,
Mark	010	036	He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Mark	010	037	They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one at your
Mark	010	038	But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking.
Mark	010	039	They said to him, "We are able."  Jesus said to them,
Mark	010	040	but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine
Mark	010	041	When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards
Mark	010	042	Jesus summoned them, and said to them, "You know that they
Mark	010	043	But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become
Mark	010	044	Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be

Mark	010	046	They came to Jericho.  As he went out from Jericho, with his
Mark	010	047	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out,
Mark	010	048	Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out
Mark	010	049	Jesus stood still, and said, "Call him."  They called
Mark	010	050	He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
Mark	010	051	Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Mark	010	052	Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your faith has made you well."
Mark	011	001	When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage{TR & NU
Mark	011	002	and said to them, "Go your way into the village that

Mark	011	004	They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door
Mark	011	005	Some of those who stood there asked them, "What are you doing,
Mark	011	006	They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
Mark	011	007	They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments
Mark	011	008	Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting
Mark	011	009	Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out,
Mark	011	010	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming
Mark	011	011	Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem.  When he had
Mark	011	012	The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.
Mark	011	013	Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see
Mark	011	014	Jesus told it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!"
Mark	011	015	They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple,
Mark	011	016	He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.
Mark	011	017	He taught, saying to them, "Isn't it written, 'My house will be
Mark	011	018	The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how
Mark	011	019	When evening came, he went out of the city.
Mark	011	020	As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered
Mark	011	021	Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look!  The fig tree
Mark	011	022	Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
Mark	011	023	For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain,
Mark	011	024	Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for,
Mark	011	025	Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything
Mark	011	026	But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven
Mark	011	027	They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple,
Mark	011	028	and they began saying to him, "By what authority do you do
Mark	011	029	Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question.  Answer me,
Mark	011	030	The baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men?
Mark	011	031	They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we should say,
Mark	011	032	If we should say, 'From men'"--they feared the people,
Mark	011	033	They answered Jesus, "We don't know."  Jesus said to them,
Mark	012	001	He began to speak to them in parables.  "A man planted a vineyard,
Mark	012	002	When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get
Mark	012	003	They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.

Mark	012	006	Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him
Mark	012	007	But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir.

Mark	012	013	They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him,

Mark	012	015	Shall we give, or shall we not give?"  But he,
Mark	012	016	They brought it.  He said to them, "Whose is this image

Mark	012	023	In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them?
Mark	012	024	Jesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken,

Mark	012	026	But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you
Mark	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Mark	012	028	One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together.
Mark	012	029	Jesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God,

Mark	012	036	For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said
Mark	012	037	Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?"

Mark	014	005	For this might have been sold for more than three hundred
Mark	014	006	But Jesus said, "Leave her alone.  Why do you trouble her?
Mark	014	007	For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to,
Mark	014	008	She has done what she could.  She has anointed my body beforehand

Mark	014	010	Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to
Mark	014	011	They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.
Mark	014	012	On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed
Mark	014	013	He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the city,
Mark	014	014	and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house,
Mark	014	015	He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready.
Mark	014	016	His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things
Mark	014	017	When it was evening he came with the twelve.
Mark	014	018	As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I
Mark	014	019	They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one,
Mark	014	020	He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me
Mark	014	021	For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him,
Mark	014	022	As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed,
Mark	014	023	He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them.
Mark	014	024	He said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant,
Mark	014	025	Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit
Mark	014	026	When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mark	014	027	Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because
Mark	014	028	However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
Mark	014	029	But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended,

Mark	014	032	They came to a place which was named Gethsemane.
Mark	014	033	He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly
Mark	014	034	He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
Mark	014	035	He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that,
Mark	014	036	He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you.
Mark	014	037	He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon,
Mark	014	038	Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.
Mark	014	039	Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
Mark	014	040	Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes
Mark	014	041	He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now,
Mark	014	042	Arise, let us be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
Mark	014	043	Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of

Mark	014	045	When he had come, immediately he came to him,
Mark	014	046	They laid their hands on him, and seized him.
Mark	014	047	But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword,
Mark	014	048	Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber,
Mark	014	049	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't
Mark	014	050	They all left him, and fled.
Mark	014	051	A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown
Mark	014	052	but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark	014	053	They led Jesus away to the high priest.  All the chief priests,
Mark	014	054	Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into
Mark	014	055	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses
Mark	014	056	For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony
Mark	014	057	Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
Mark	014	058	"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is
Mark	014	059	Even so, their testimony did not agree.
Mark	014	060	The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you
Mark	014	061	But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing.  Again the high priest
Mark	014	062	Jesus said, "I am.  You will see the Son of Man sitting
Mark	014	063	The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need
Mark	014	064	You have heard the blasphemy!  What do you think?"
Mark	014	065	Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat
Mark	014	066	As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of
Mark	014	067	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said,
Mark	014	068	But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you
Mark	014	069	The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by,
Mark	014	070	But he again denied it.  After a little while again those

Mark	014	072	The rooster crowed the second time.  Peter remembered the word,
Mark	015	001	Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders
Mark	015	002	Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"  He answered,
Mark	015	003	The chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark	015	004	Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer?  See how many
Mark	015	005	But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
Mark	015	006	Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner,
Mark	015	007	There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made
Mark	015	008	The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always
Mark	015	009	Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you
Mark	015	010	For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had
Mark	015	011	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should
Mark	015	012	Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom
Mark	015	013	They cried out again, "Crucify him!"
Mark	015	014	Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"
Mark	015	015	Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas
Mark	015	016	The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium;
Mark	015	017	They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns,
Mark	015	018	They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Mark	015	019	They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing
Mark	015	020	When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him,
Mark	015	021	They compelled one passing by, coming from the country,
Mark	015	022	They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is,
Mark	015	023	They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he
Mark	015	024	Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them,
Mark	015	025	It was the third hour,{9:00 A. M.} and they crucified him.
Mark	015	026	The superscription of his accusation was written over him,
Mark	015	027	With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand,
Mark	015	028	The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was
Mark	015	029	Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
Mark	015	030	save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
Mark	015	031	Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with
Mark	015	032	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from
Mark	015	033	When the sixth hour{or, noon} had come, there was darkness
Mark	015	034	At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi,
Mark	015	035	Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold,
Mark	015	036	One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on
Mark	015	037	Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
Mark	015	038	The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
Mark	015	039	When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried
Mark	015	040	There were also women watching from afar, among whom were
Mark	015	041	who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him;
Mark	015	042	When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day,
Mark	015	043	Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself
Mark	015	044	Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning
Mark	015	045	When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
Mark	015	046	He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen
Mark	015	047	Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where
Mark	016	001	When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother
Mark	016	002	Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb
Mark	016	003	They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone
Mark	016	004	for it was very big.  Looking up, they saw that the stone
Mark	016	005	Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on
Mark	016	006	He said to them, "Don't be amazed.  You seek Jesus,
Mark	016	007	But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you
Mark	016	008	They went out,{TR adds "quickly"} and fled from the tomb,
Mark	016	009	Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week,
Mark	016	010	She went and told those who had been with him, as they
Mark	016	011	When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen
Mark	016	012	After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them,
Mark	016	013	They went away and told it to the rest.  They didn't
Mark	016	014	Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat
Mark	016	015	He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the Good News
Mark	016	016	He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who
Mark	016	017	These signs will accompany those who believe:  in my name they
Mark	016	018	they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing,

Luke	001	009	according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
Luke	001	010	The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at
Luke	001	011	An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
Luke	001	012	Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
Luke	001	013	But the angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your

Luke	001	015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink
Luke	001	016	He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
Luke	001	017	He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah,
Luke	001	018	Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this?
Luke	001	019	The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence
Luke	001	020	Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day
Luke	001	021	The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled
Luke	001	022	When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they
Luke	001	023	It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled,
Luke	001	024	After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid
Luke	001	025	"Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked
Luke	001	026	Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
Luke	001	027	to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph,
Luke	001	028	Having come in, the angel said to her, "Rejoice, you highly
Luke	001	029	But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying,
Luke	001	030	The angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have
Luke	001	031	Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son,
Luke	001	032	He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High.
Luke	001	033	and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
Luke	001	034	Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?"
Luke	001	035	The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you,
Luke	001	036	Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son
Luke	001	037	For everything spoken by God is possible."
Luke	001	038	Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
Luke	001	039	Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste,
Luke	001	040	and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke	001	041	It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,
Luke	001	042	She called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you
Luke	001	043	Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
Luke	001	044	For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears,
Luke	001	045	Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment
Luke	001	046	Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
Luke	001	047	My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
Luke	001	048	for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.
Luke	001	049	For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
Luke	001	050	His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.
Luke	001	051	He has shown strength with his arm.  He has scattered the proud
Luke	001	052	He has put down princes from their thrones.  And has

Luke	001	056	Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned
Luke	001	057	Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled,
Luke	001	058	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified
Luke	001	059	It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise

Luke	001	063	He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."
Luke	001	064	His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed,
Luke	001	065	Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings
Luke	001	066	All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then
Luke	001	067	His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit,

Luke	002	004	Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
Luke	002	005	to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married
Luke	002	006	It happened, while they were there, that the day had come
Luke	002	007	She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him
Luke	002	008	There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field,
Luke	002	009	Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory
Luke	002	010	The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring

Luke	002	012	This is the sign to you:  you will find a baby wrapped in strips
Luke	002	013	Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
Luke	002	014	"Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men."
Luke	002	015	It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky,
Luke	002	016	They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph,
Luke	002	017	When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was
Luke	002	018	All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken
Luke	002	019	But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
Luke	002	020	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for

Luke	002	029	"Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to
Luke	002	030	for my eyes have seen your salvation,
Luke	002	031	which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
Luke	002	032	a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of
Luke	002	033	Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were

Luke	002	041	His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast
Luke	002	042	When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
Luke	002	043	and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning,
Luke	002	044	but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey,
Luke	002	045	When they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem,
Luke	002	046	It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
Luke	002	047	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
Luke	002	048	When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother
Luke	002	049	He said to them, "Why were you looking for me?  Didn't you
Luke	002	050	They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.
Luke	002	051	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth.
Luke	002	052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor
Luke	003	001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,

Luke	003	009	Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees.
Luke	003	010	The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"
Luke	003	011	He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him

Luke	003	019	but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias,
Luke	003	020	added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
Luke	003	021	Now it happened, when all the people were baptized,

Luke	004	007	If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."
Luke	004	008	Jesus answered him, "Get behind me Satan!  For it is written,
Luke	004	009	He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
Luke	004	010	for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge concerning you,
Luke	004	011	and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you

Luke	004	013	When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed
Luke	004	014	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee,
Luke	004	015	He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
Luke	004	016	He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.  He entered,
Luke	004	017	The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him.
Luke	004	018	"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me
Luke	004	019	and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."{Isaiah 61:1-2}
Luke	004	020	He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down.
Luke	004	021	He began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled
Luke	004	022	All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious
Luke	004	023	He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable,
Luke	004	024	He said, "Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable
Luke	004	025	But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days
Luke	004	026	Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath,
Luke	004	027	There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet,
Luke	004	028	They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they
Luke	004	029	They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow
Luke	004	030	But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.
Luke	004	031	He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee.  He was teaching
Luke	004	032	and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word
Luke	004	033	In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an
Luke	004	034	saying, "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth?
Luke	004	035	Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
Luke	004	036	Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another,
Luke	004	037	News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
Luke	004	038	He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.
Luke	004	039	He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her.
Luke	004	040	When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various
Luke	004	041	Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying,
Luke	004	042	When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place,
Luke	004	043	But he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the
Luke	004	044	He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke	005	001	Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard
Luke	005	002	He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had
Luke	005	003	He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's,
Luke	005	004	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into
Luke	005	005	Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing;
Luke	005	006	When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish,
Luke	005	007	They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they
Luke	005	008	But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus'
Luke	005	009	For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch
Luke	005	010	and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were
Luke	005	011	When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything,
Luke	005	012	It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold,
Luke	005	013	He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to.
Luke	005	014	He charged him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show
Luke	005	015	But the report concerning him spread much more, and great
Luke	005	016	But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.
Luke	005	017	It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching;
Luke	005	018	Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought
Luke	005	019	Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude,
Luke	005	020	Seeing their faith, he said to him, "Man, your sins
Luke	005	021	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is
Luke	005	022	But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are
Luke	005	023	Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say,
Luke	005	024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority
Luke	005	025	Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which
Luke	005	026	Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God.
Luke	005	027	After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named
Luke	005	028	He left everything, and rose up and followed him.
Luke	005	029	Levi made a great feast for him in his house.
Luke	005	030	Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against
Luke	005	031	Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need
Luke	005	032	I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Luke	005	033	They said to him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and pray,
Luke	005	034	He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast,
Luke	005	035	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away
Luke	005	036	He also told a parable to them.  "No one puts a piece from
Luke	005	037	No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine
Luke	005	038	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins,
Luke	005	039	No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says,
Luke	006	001	Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first,
Luke	006	002	But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that
Luke	006	003	Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you read what David did
Luke	006	004	how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate
Luke	006	005	He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."
Luke	006	006	It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into
Luke	006	007	The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether
Luke	006	008	But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had
Luke	006	009	Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something:
Luke	006	010	He looked around at them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out
Luke	006	011	But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another
Luke	006	012	It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain
Luke	006	013	When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them
Luke	006	014	Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother;
Luke	006	015	Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was
Luke	006	016	Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also
Luke	006	017	He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd
Luke	006	018	as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits,
Luke	006	019	All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from
Luke	006	020	He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "Blessed are
Luke	006	021	Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled.
Luke	006	022	Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall
Luke	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward
Luke	006	024	"But woe to you who are rich!  For you have received
Luke	006	025	Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry.
Luke	006	026	Woe,{TR adds "to you"} when{TR adds "all"} men speak well of you,
Luke	006	027	"But I tell you who hear:  love your enemies, do good to those
Luke	006	028	bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
Luke	006	029	To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other;
Luke	006	030	Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask him who takes
Luke	006	031	"As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.
Luke	006	032	If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
Luke	006	033	If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is
Luke	006	034	If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive,
Luke	006	035	But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back;
Luke	006	036	Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful.
Luke	006	037	Don't judge, and you won't be judged.  Don't condemn, and you
Luke	006	038	"Give, and it will be given to you:  good measure, pressed down,
Luke	006	039	He spoke a parable to them.  "Can the blind guide the blind?
Luke	006	040	A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is
Luke	006	041	Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye,
Luke	006	042	Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove
Luke	006	043	For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit;
Luke	006	044	For each tree is known by its own fruit.  For people don't
Luke	006	045	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings
Luke	006	046	"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things
Luke	006	047	Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them,
Luke	006	048	He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep,
Luke	006	049	But he who hears, and doesn't do, is like a man who built a house
Luke	007	001	After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people,
Luke	007	002	A certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick
Luke	007	003	When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews,
Luke	007	004	When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying,
Luke	007	005	for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."
Luke	007	006	Jesus went with them.  When he was now not far from the house,
Luke	007	007	Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you;
Luke	007	008	For I also am a man placed under authority, having under
Luke	007	009	When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned
Luke	007	010	Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant
Luke	007	011	It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain.
Luke	007	012	Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who
Luke	007	013	When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
Luke	007	014	He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still.
Luke	007	015	He who was dead sat up, and began to speak.  And he gave him
Luke	007	016	Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great
Luke	007	017	This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea,
Luke	007	018	The disciples of John told him about all these things.
Luke	007	019	John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them
Luke	007	020	When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has
Luke	007	021	In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits;
Luke	007	022	Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you
Luke	007	023	Blessed is he who is not offended by me."
Luke	007	024	When John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes
Luke	007	025	But what did you go out to see?  A man clothed in soft clothing?
Luke	007	026	But what did you go out to see?  A prophet?  Yes, I tell you,
Luke	007	027	This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger
Luke	007	028	"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not
Luke	007	029	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared
Luke	007	030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God,
Luke	007	031	But the Lord said,{So reads TR.  MT omits "But the Lord said,"}
Luke	007	032	They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one
Luke	007	033	For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine,
Luke	007	034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say,
Luke	007	035	Wisdom is justified by all her children."
Luke	007	036	One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him.
Luke	007	037	Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew
Luke	007	038	Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet
Luke	007	039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said
Luke	007	040	Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."
Luke	007	041	"A certain lender had two debtors.  The one owed five
Luke	007	042	When they couldn't pay, he forgave them both.  Which of them
Luke	007	043	Simon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most."
Luke	007	044	Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
Luke	007	045	You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in,
Luke	007	046	You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed
Luke	007	047	Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven,
Luke	007	048	He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
Luke	007	049	Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves,
Luke	007	050	He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you.
Luke	008	001	It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities
Luke	008	002	and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits
Luke	008	003	and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward; Susanna;
Luke	008	004	When a great multitude came together, and people from every
Luke	008	005	"The farmer went out to sow his seed.  As he sowed,
Luke	008	006	Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew,
Luke	008	007	Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it,
Luke	008	008	Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit
Luke	008	009	Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"
Luke	008	010	He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom
Luke	008	011	Now the parable is this:  The seed is the word of God.
Luke	008	012	Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes,
Luke	008	013	Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word
Luke	008	014	That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard,
Luke	008	015	That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest
Luke	008	016	"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container,
Luke	008	017	For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret,
Luke	008	018	Be careful therefore how you hear.  For whoever has, to him
Luke	008	019	His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come
Luke	008	020	It was told him by some saying, "Your mother and your brothers
Luke	008	021	But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these
Luke	008	022	Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered
Luke	008	023	But as they sailed, he fell asleep.  A wind storm came down on
Luke	008	024	They came to him, and awoke him, saying, "Master, master,
Luke	008	025	He said to them, "Where is your faith?"  Being afraid they marveled,
Luke	008	026	They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes,
Luke	008	027	When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city
Luke	008	028	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,
Luke	008	029	For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
Luke	008	030	Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"  He said, "Legion,"
Luke	008	031	They begged him that he would not command them to go
Luke	008	032	Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain,
Luke	008	033	The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs,
Luke	008	034	When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled,
Luke	008	035	People went out to see what had happened.  They came to Jesus,
Luke	008	036	Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed
Luke	008	037	All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked
Luke	008	038	But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him
Luke	008	039	"Return to your house, and declare what great things God has
Luke	008	040	It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him,
Luke	008	041	Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
Luke	008	042	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she
Luke	008	043	A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent
Luke	008	044	came behind him, and touched the fringe{or, tassel} of his cloak,
Luke	008	045	Jesus said, "Who touched me?"  When all denied it, Peter and those
Luke	008	046	But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power
Luke	008	047	When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling,
Luke	008	048	He said to her, "Daughter, cheer up.  Your faith has made you well.
Luke	008	049	While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's
Luke	008	050	But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don't be afraid.
Luke	008	051	When he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter in,
Luke	008	052	All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, "Don't weep.
Luke	008	053	They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
Luke	008	054	But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand,
Luke	008	055	Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately.
Luke	008	056	Her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one
Luke	009	001	He called the twelve{TR reads "his twelve disciples"
Luke	009	002	He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to
Luke	009	003	He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs,
Luke	009	004	Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.
Luke	009	005	As many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city,
Luke	009	006	They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the
Luke	009	007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him;
Luke	009	008	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one
Luke	009	009	Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I
Luke	009	010	The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they
Luke	009	011	But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him.
Luke	009	012	The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said
Luke	009	013	But he said to them, "You give them something to eat."
Luke	009	014	For they were about five thousand men.  He said to his disciples,
Luke	009	015	They did so, and made them all sit down.
Luke	009	016	He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up
Luke	009	017	They ate, and were all filled.  They gathered up twelve baskets
Luke	009	018	It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples
Luke	009	019	They answered, "'John the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,'
Luke	009	020	He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Luke	009	021	But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
Luke	009	022	saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected
Luke	009	023	He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me,
Luke	009	024	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever
Luke	009	025	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world,
Luke	009	026	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
Luke	009	027	But I tell you the truth:  There are some of those who
Luke	009	028	It happened about eight days after these sayings,
Luke	009	029	As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered,
Luke	009	030	Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
Luke	009	031	who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure,{literally,
Luke	009	032	Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep,
Luke	009	033	It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter
Luke	009	034	While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them,
Luke	009	035	A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son.
Luke	009	036	When the voice came, Jesus was found alone.  They were silent,
Luke	009	037	It happened on the next day, when they had come down from
Luke	009	038	Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg
Luke	009	039	Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it
Luke	009	040	I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn't."
Luke	009	041	Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation,
Luke	009	042	While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed
Luke	009	043	They were all astonished at the majesty of God.
Luke	009	044	"Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man
Luke	009	045	But they didn't understand this saying.  It was concealed from them,
Luke	009	046	There arose an argument among them about which of them
Luke	009	047	Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child,
Luke	009	048	and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name
Luke	009	049	John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons
Luke	009	050	Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not against

Luke	009	052	and sent messengers before his face.  They went, and entered
Luke	009	053	They didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face
Luke	009	054	When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord,
Luke	009	055	But he turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind
Luke	009	056	For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives,
Luke	009	057	As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want

Luke	009	059	He said to another, "Follow me!"  But he said, "Lord, allow me
Luke	009	060	But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead,
Luke	009	061	Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow
Luke	009	062	But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow,
Luke	010	001	Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others,
Luke	010	002	Then he said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful,
Luke	010	003	Go your ways.  Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
Luke	010	004	Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals.  Greet no one on the way.
Luke	010	005	Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'
Luke	010	006	If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him;

Luke	010	017	The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons
Luke	010	018	He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning
Luke	010	019	Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions,
Luke	010	020	Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject
Luke	010	021	In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said,
Luke	010	022	Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been
Luke	010	023	Turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are
Luke	010	024	for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see

Luke	010	027	He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all
Luke	010	028	He said to him, "You have answered correctly.  Do this,

Luke	010	031	By chance a certain priest was going down that way.
Luke	010	032	In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place,
Luke	010	033	But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was.
Luke	010	034	came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
Luke	010	035	On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii,
Luke	010	036	Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor
Luke	010	037	He said, "He who showed mercy on him."  Then Jesus said to him,

Luke	010	040	But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up
Luke	010	041	Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled
Luke	010	042	but one thing is needed.  Mary has chosen the good part,
Luke	011	001	It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place,
Luke	011	002	He said to them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father in heaven,
Luke	011	003	Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke	011	004	Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone

Luke	011	010	For everyone who asks receives.  He who seeks finds.
Luke	011	011	"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give
Luke	011	012	Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, will he?
Luke	011	013	If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to

Luke	011	015	But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul,

Luke	011	017	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom
Luke	011	018	If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?
Luke	011	019	But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children
Luke	011	020	But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom

Luke	011	024	The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man,
Luke	011	025	When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.
Luke	011	026	Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil
Luke	011	027	It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman
Luke	011	028	But he said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear

Luke	011	035	Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness.
Luke	011	036	If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark,
Luke	011	037	Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him.
Luke	011	038	When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first
Luke	011	039	The Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside
Luke	011	040	You foolish ones, didn't he who made the outside make
Luke	011	041	But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within,

Luke	011	043	Woe to you Pharisees!  For you love the best seats in the synagogues,
Luke	011	044	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you
Luke	011	045	One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying this you

Luke	011	047	Woe to you!  For you build the tombs of the prophets,
Luke	011	048	So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers.
Luke	011	049	Therefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets

Luke	012	001	Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together,
Luke	012	002	But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed,

Luke	012	023	Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
Luke	012	024	Consider the ravens:  they don't sow, they don't reap,

Luke	012	026	If then you aren't able to do even the least things, why are
Luke	012	027	Consider the lilies, how they grow.  They don't toil,
Luke	012	028	But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field,
Luke	012	029	Don't seek what you will eat or what you will drink;
Luke	012	030	For the nations of the world seek after all of these things,
Luke	012	031	But seek God's Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.
Luke	012	032	Don't be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good

Luke	012	034	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Luke	012	035	"Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning.
Luke	012	036	Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns
Luke	012	037	Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when

Luke	012	040	Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour
Luke	012	041	Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us,

Luke	012	043	Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so
Luke	012	044	Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.
Luke	012	045	But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,'
Luke	012	046	then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't
Luke	012	047	That servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare,

Luke	012	050	But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed
Luke	012	051	Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth?
Luke	012	052	For from now on, there will be five in one house divided,
Luke	012	053	They will be divided, father against son, and son against father;

Luke	012	055	When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,'
Luke	012	056	You hypocrites!  You know how to interpret the appearance
Luke	012	057	Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
Luke	012	058	For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate,
Luke	012	059	I tell you, you will by no means get out of there,
Luke	013	001	Now there were some present at the same time who told

Luke	013	011	Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity
Luke	013	012	When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, "Woman,

Luke	013	031	On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him,

Luke	014	002	Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.
Luke	014	003	Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
Luke	014	004	But they were silent.  He took him, and healed him,
Luke	014	005	He answered them, "Which of you, if your son{TR reads "donkey"
Luke	014	006	They couldn't answer him regarding these things.
Luke	014	007	He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed
Luke	014	008	"When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit
Luke	014	009	and he who invited both of you would come and tell you,
Luke	014	010	But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place,
Luke	014	011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever

Luke	014	013	But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame,
Luke	014	014	and you will be blessed, because they don't have the resources
Luke	014	015	When one of those who sat at the table with him heard
Luke	014	016	But he said to him, "A certain man made a great supper,
Luke	014	017	He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who
Luke	014	018	They all as one began to make excuses.  "The first said
Luke	014	019	"Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must

Luke	014	021	"That servant came, and told his lord these things.
Luke	014	022	"The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded,

Luke	014	026	"If anyone comes to me, and doesn't hate his own father,

Luke	014	028	For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit
Luke	014	029	Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able
Luke	014	030	saying, 'This man began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'
Luke	014	031	Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war,
Luke	014	032	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy,

Luke	014	035	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile.
Luke	015	001	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him
Luke	015	002	The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man
Luke	015	003	He told them this parable.
Luke	015	004	"Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one

Luke	015	009	When she has found it, she calls together her friends
Luke	015	010	Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels

Luke	015	012	The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share
Luke	015	013	Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this
Luke	015	014	When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine
Luke	015	015	He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country,
Luke	015	016	He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate,
Luke	015	017	But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired

Luke	015	021	The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven,
Luke	015	022	"But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe,
Luke	015	023	Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;

Luke	015	025	"Now his elder son was in the field.  As he came near to the house,
Luke	015	026	He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.
Luke	015	027	He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has
Luke	015	028	But he was angry, and would not go in.  Therefore his father

Luke	016	008	"His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely,

Luke	016	012	If you have not been faithful in that which is another's,
Luke	016	013	No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one,
Luke	016	014	The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things,

Luke	016	022	It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away
Luke	016	023	In Hades{or, Hell}, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment,

Luke	017	021	neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold,

Luke	017	037	They answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?"  He said to them,
Luke	018	001	He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray,
Luke	018	002	saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God,
Luke	018	003	A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying,
Luke	018	004	He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself,
Luke	018	005	yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else
Luke	018	006	The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
Luke	018	007	Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him
Luke	018	008	I tell you that he will avenge them quickly.  Nevertheless, when the
Luke	018	009	He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced
Luke	018	010	"Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee,
Luke	018	011	The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this:
Luke	018	012	I fast twice a week.  I give tithes of all that I get.'
Luke	018	013	But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift
Luke	018	014	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather

Luke	018	020	You know the commandments:  'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,'
Luke	018	021	He said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up."
Luke	018	022	When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "You still lack
Luke	018	023	But when he heard these things, he became very sad,

Luke	018	033	They will scourge and kill him.  On the third day,
Luke	018	034	They understood none of these things.  This saying was hidden
Luke	018	035	It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat
Luke	018	036	Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.
Luke	018	037	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
Luke	018	038	He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
Luke	018	039	Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet;
Luke	018	040	Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him.
Luke	018	041	"What do you want me to do?"  He said, "Lord, that I
Luke	018	042	Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight.  Your faith has healed you."
Luke	018	043	Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God.
Luke	019	001	He entered and was passing through Jericho.
Luke	019	002	There was a man named Zacchaeus.  He was a chief tax collector,
Luke	019	003	He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn't because of
Luke	019	004	He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him,
Luke	019	005	When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him,
Luke	019	006	He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.
Luke	019	007	When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, "He has gone
Luke	019	008	Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of
Luke	019	009	Jesus said to him, "Today, salvation has come to this house,
Luke	019	010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
Luke	019	011	As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable,
Luke	019	012	He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country
Luke	019	013	He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins,{10
Luke	019	014	But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him,
Luke	019	015	"It happened when he had come back again, having received
Luke	019	016	The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made
Luke	019	017	"He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant!  Because you
Luke	019	018	"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'
Luke	019	019	"So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
Luke	019	020	Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept
Luke	019	021	for I feared you, because you are an exacting man.
Luke	019	022	"He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you,
Luke	019	023	Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming,
Luke	019	024	He said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him,
Luke	019	025	"They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'
Luke	019	026	'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given;
Luke	019	027	But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign
Luke	019	028	Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke	019	029	It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage{TR, NU read "Bethpage"
Luke	019	030	saying, "Go your way into the village on the other side,
Luke	019	031	If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him:
Luke	019	032	Those who were sent went away, and found things just as
Luke	019	033	As they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them,
Luke	019	034	They said, "The Lord needs it."
Luke	019	035	They brought it to Jesus.  They threw their cloaks on the colt,
Luke	019	036	As he went, they spread their cloaks in the way.
Luke	019	037	As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives,
Luke	019	038	saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!{Psalm
Luke	019	039	Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, "Teacher,

Luke	019	043	For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up
Luke	019	044	and will dash you and your children within you to the ground.
Luke	019	045	He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who

Luke	019	048	They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung
Luke	020	001	It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people
Luke	020	002	They asked him, "Tell us:  by what authority do you do these things?
Luke	020	003	He answered them, "I also will ask you one question.  Tell me:
Luke	020	004	the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"
Luke	020	005	They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,'
Luke	020	006	But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us,
Luke	020	007	They answered that they didn't know where it was from.
Luke	020	008	Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority
Luke	020	009	He began to tell the people this parable.  "A {NU (in brackets)

Luke	020	013	The lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do?

Luke	020	015	They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
Luke	020	016	He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give

Luke	020	020	They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous,
Luke	020	021	They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach
Luke	020	022	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
Luke	020	023	But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "Why do
Luke	020	024	Show me a denarius.  Whose image and inscription are on it?"
Luke	020	025	He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
Luke	020	026	They weren't able to trap him in his words before the people.
Luke	020	027	Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there
Luke	020	028	They asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's
Luke	020	029	There were therefore seven brothers.  The first took a wife,
Luke	020	030	The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
Luke	020	031	The third took her, and likewise the seven all left
Luke	020	032	Afterward the woman also died.
Luke	020	033	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be?
Luke	020	034	Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are
Luke	020	035	But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age
Luke	020	036	For they can't die any more, for they are like the angels,

Luke	020	038	Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living,
Luke	020	039	Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."
Luke	020	040	They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.
Luke	020	041	He said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?
Luke	020	042	David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said
Luke	020	043	until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'{Psalm 110:1}
Luke	020	044	"David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"
Luke	020	045	In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
Luke	020	046	"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love
Luke	020	047	who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers:
Luke	021	001	He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their

Luke	021	009	When you hear of wars and disturbances, don't be terrified,
Luke	021	010	Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation,

Luke	021	014	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand
Luke	021	015	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries
Luke	021	016	You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives,

Luke	021	021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Luke	021	022	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are
Luke	021	023	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants
Luke	021	024	They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive
Luke	021	025	There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth
Luke	021	026	men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things
Luke	021	027	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power
Luke	021	028	But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up
Luke	021	029	He told them a parable.  "See the fig tree, and all the trees.
Luke	021	030	When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own

Luke	022	005	They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
Luke	022	006	He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them
Luke	022	007	The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover
Luke	022	008	He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover
Luke	022	009	They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
Luke	022	010	He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city,

Luke	022	014	When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
Luke	022	015	He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover

Luke	022	017	He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,
Luke	022	018	for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit

Luke	022	028	But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
Luke	022	029	I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,
Luke	022	030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom.
Luke	022	031	The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you,
Luke	022	032	but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail.
Luke	022	033	He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison

Luke	022	044	Being in agony he prayed more earnestly.  His sweat became

Luke	022	046	and said to them, "Why do you sleep?  Rise and pray that you

Luke	022	049	When those who were around him saw what was about to happen,
Luke	022	050	A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest,

Luke	022	058	After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You also

Luke	022	060	But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about!"
Luke	022	061	The Lord turned, and looked at Peter.  Then Peter remembered
Luke	022	062	He went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke	022	063	The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
Luke	022	064	Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and
Luke	022	065	They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
Luke	022	066	As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people
Luke	022	067	"If you are the Christ, tell us."  But he said to them,
Luke	022	068	and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
Luke	022	069	From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand
Luke	022	070	They all said, "Are you then the Son of God?"  He said to them,
Luke	022	071	They said, "Why do we need any more witness?  For we ourselves

Luke	023	002	They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting

Luke	023	004	Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find

Luke	023	010	The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Luke	023	011	Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him.
Luke	023	012	Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day,

Luke	023	014	and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one that
Luke	023	015	Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy

Luke	023	017	Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
Luke	023	018	But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man!
Luke	023	019	one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city,

Luke	023	021	but they shouted, saying, "Crucify!  Crucify him!"
Luke	023	022	He said to them the third time, "Why?  What evil has this man done?
Luke	023	023	But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might

Luke	023	053	He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him
Luke	023	054	It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
Luke	023	055	The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after,

Luke	024	001	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and
Luke	024	002	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
Luke	024	003	They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.

Luke	024	005	Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
Luke	024	006	He isn't here, but is risen.  Remember what he told you
Luke	024	007	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands
Luke	024	008	They remembered his words,
Luke	024	009	returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven,
Luke	024	010	Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James.
Luke	024	011	These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they
Luke	024	012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.  Stooping and looking in,
Luke	024	013	Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village
Luke	024	014	They talked with each other about all of these things
Luke	024	015	It happened, while they talked and questioned together,
Luke	024	016	But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
Luke	024	017	He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk,
Luke	024	018	One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only
Luke	024	019	He said to them, "What things?"  They said to him, "The things
Luke	024	020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up
Luke	024	021	But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel.
Luke	024	022	Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived
Luke	024	023	and when they didn't find his body, they came saying that they
Luke	024	024	Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women
Luke	024	025	He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
Luke	024	026	Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter
Luke	024	027	Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained
Luke	024	028	They drew near to the village, where they were going,
Luke	024	029	They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening,
Luke	024	030	It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them,
Luke	024	031	Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished
Luke	024	032	They said one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us,
Luke	024	033	They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found
Luke	024	034	saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
Luke	024	035	They related the things that happened along the way, and how
Luke	024	036	As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them,
Luke	024	037	But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed
Luke	024	038	He said to them, "Why are you troubled?  Why do doubts arise
Luke	024	039	See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me.
Luke	024	040	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke	024	041	While they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered,
Luke	024	042	They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
Luke	024	043	He took them, and ate in front of them.
Luke	024	044	He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still
Luke	024	045	Then he opened their minds, that they might understand
Luke	024	046	He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary
Luke	024	047	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
Luke	024	048	You are witnesses of these things.
Luke	024	049	Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you.
Luke	024	050	He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands,
Luke	024	051	It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them,
Luke	024	052	They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
Luke	024	053	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.  Amen.
John	001	001	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
John	001	002	The same was in the beginning with God.
John	001	003	All things were made through him.  Without him was not anything
John	001	004	In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John	001	005	The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
John	001	006	There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
John	001	007	The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light,
John	001	008	He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify
John	001	009	The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
John	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made through him,
John	001	011	He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him.
John	001	012	But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become
John	001	013	who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
John	001	014	The Word became flesh, and lived among us.  We saw his glory,
John	001	015	John testified about him.  He cried out, saying, "This was
John	001	016	From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
John	001	017	For the law was given through Moses.  Grace and truth came

John	001	019	This is John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites
John	001	020	He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, "I am
John	001	021	They asked him, "What then?  Are you Elijah?"  He said, "I am not."
John	001	022	They said therefore to him, "Who are you?
John	001	023	He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
John	001	024	The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
John	001	025	They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
John	001	026	John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands
John	001	027	He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me,
John	001	028	These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan,
John	001	029	The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold,
John	001	030	This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred
John	001	031	I didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water:
John	001	032	John testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending
John	001	033	I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water,
John	001	034	I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."
John	001	035	Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,
John	001	036	and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold,
John	001	037	The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John	001	038	Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are
John	001	039	He said to them, "Come, and see."  They came and saw
John	001	040	One of the two who heard John, and followed him,
John	001	041	He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him,
John	001	042	He brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him, and said,
John	001	043	On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee,
John	001	044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
John	001	045	Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him,
John	001	046	Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out
John	001	047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold,
John	001	048	Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"  Jesus answered him,
John	001	049	Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God!  You are
John	001	050	Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath
John	001	051	He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you
John	002	001	The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee.
John	002	002	Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
John	002	003	When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him,
John	002	004	Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me?
John	002	005	His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."
John	002	006	Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews'
John	002	007	Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water."
John	002	008	He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler
John	002	009	When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine,
John	002	010	and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first,
John	002	011	This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee,
John	002	012	After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
John	002	013	The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went
John	002	014	He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves,
John	002	015	He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple,
John	002	016	To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here!
John	002	017	His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your
John	002	018	The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show us,
John	002	019	Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days
John	002	020	The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple
John	002	021	But he spoke of the temple of his body.
John	002	022	When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples
John	002	023	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast,
John	002	024	But Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,
John	002	025	and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man;
John	003	001	Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
John	003	002	The same came to him by night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know
John	003	003	Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you,
John	003	004	Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old?
John	003	005	Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born
John	003	006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  That which is born
John	003	007	Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'
John	003	008	The wind{The same Greek word (pneuma) means wind, breath,
John	003	009	Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"
John	003	010	Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't
John	003	011	Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know,
John	003	012	If I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will
John	003	013	No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven,
John	003	014	As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
John	003	015	that whoever believes in him should not perish,
John	003	016	For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and
John	003	017	For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world,
John	003	018	He who believes in him is not judged.  He who doesn't believe has
John	003	019	This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world,
John	003	020	For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come
John	003	021	But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works
John	003	022	After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land
John	003	023	John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there
John	003	024	For John was not yet thrown into prison.
John	003	025	There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's
John	003	026	They came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with
John	003	027	John answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been
John	003	028	You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,'
John	003	029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of
John	003	030	He must increase, but I must decrease.
John	003	031	He who comes from above is above all.  He who is from
John	003	032	What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one
John	003	033	He who has received his witness has set his seal to this,
John	003	034	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God
John	003	035	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
John	003	036	One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one
John	004	001	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard
John	004	002	(although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),
John	004	003	he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.
John	004	004	He needed to pass through Samaria.
John	004	005	So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel
John	004	006	Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, being tired
John	004	007	A woman of Samaria came to draw water.  Jesus said to her,
John	004	008	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
John	004	009	The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that you,
John	004	010	Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it
John	004	011	The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with,
John	004	012	Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well,
John	004	013	Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water
John	004	014	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never
John	004	015	The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I
John	004	016	Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
John	004	017	The woman answered, "I have no husband."  Jesus said to her,
John	004	018	for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is
John	004	019	The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
John	004	020	Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that
John	004	021	Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes,
John	004	022	You worship that which you don't know.  We worship that which we know;
John	004	023	But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers
John	004	024	God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in
John	004	025	The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes,"
John	004	026	Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who speaks to you."
John	004	027	At this, his disciples came.  They marveled that he was speaking
John	004	028	So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city,
John	004	029	"Come, see a man who told me everything that I did.
John	004	030	They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
John	004	031	In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
John	004	032	But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."
John	004	033	The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone
John	004	034	Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me,
John	004	035	Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?'
John	004	036	He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life;
John	004	037	For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
John	004	038	I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored.
John	004	039	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of
John	004	040	So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay
John	004	041	Many more believed because of his word.
John	004	042	They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking;
John	004	043	After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.
John	004	044	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor
John	004	045	So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him,
John	004	046	Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made
John	004	047	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee,
John	004	048	Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders,
John	004	049	The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
John	004	050	Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your son lives."
John	004	051	As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported,
John	004	052	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better.
John	004	053	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said
John	004	054	This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come
John	005	001	After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus
John	005	002	Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is
John	005	003	In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame,
John	005	004	for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into
John	005	005	A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
John	005	006	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick
John	005	007	The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into
John	005	008	Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
John	005	009	Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
John	005	010	So the Jews said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath.
John	005	011	He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me,
John	005	012	Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you,
John	005	013	But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus
John	005	014	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
John	005	015	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had
John	005	016	For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him,
John	005	017	But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working,
John	005	018	For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him,
John	005	019	Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son
John	005	020	For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all
John	005	021	For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
John	005	022	For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment
John	005	023	that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
John	005	024	"Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him
John	005	025	Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is,
John	005	026	For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son
John	005	027	He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is
John	005	028	Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are
John	005	029	and will come out; those who have done good, to the
John	005	030	I can of myself do nothing.  As I hear, I judge, and my
John	005	031	"If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.
John	005	032	It is another who testifies about me.  I know that the testimony
John	005	033	You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
John	005	034	But the testimony which I receive is not from man.
John	005	035	He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing
John	005	036	But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John,
John	005	037	The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me.
John	005	038	You don't have his word living in you; because you don't
John	005	039	"You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you
John	005	040	Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.
John	005	041	I don't receive glory from men.
John	005	042	But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.
John	005	043	I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me.
John	005	044	How can you believe, who receive glory from one another,
John	005	045	"Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father.
John	005	046	For if you believed Moses, you would believe me;
John	005	047	But if you don't believe his writings, how will you
John	006	001	After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea
John	006	002	A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs
John	006	003	Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
John	006	004	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
John	006	005	Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great
John	006	006	This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
John	006	007	Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread
John	006	008	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
John	006	009	"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish,
John	006	010	Jesus said, "Have the people sit down."  Now there was much
John	006	011	Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed
John	006	012	When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up
John	006	013	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken
John	006	014	When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said,
John	006	015	Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come
John	006	016	When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
John	006	017	and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea
John	006	018	The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
John	006	019	When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty
John	006	020	But he said to them, "It is I{or, I AM}. Don't be afraid."
John	006	021	They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat.
John	006	022	On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other
John	006	023	However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they
John	006	024	When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there,
John	006	025	When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him,
John	006	026	Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me,
John	006	027	Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which
John	006	028	They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work
John	006	029	Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe
John	006	030	They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign,
John	006	031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.  As it is written,
John	006	032	Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you,
John	006	033	For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven,
John	006	034	They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
John	006	035	Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.  He who comes
John	006	036	But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
John	006	037	All those who the Father gives me will come to me.
John	006	038	For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will,
John	006	039	This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has
John	006	040	This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees
John	006	041	The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,
John	006	042	They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
John	006	043	Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
John	006	044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him,
John	006	045	It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by
John	006	046	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God.
John	006	047	Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
John	006	048	I am the bread of life.
John	006	049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
John	006	050	This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone
John	006	051	I am the living bread which came down out of heaven.
John	006	052	The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can
John	006	053	Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you,
John	006	054	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,
John	006	055	For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
John	006	056	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me,
John	006	057	As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father;
John	006	058	This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our
John	006	059	These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
John	006	060	Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said,
John	006	061	But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,
John	006	062	Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where
John	006	063	It is the spirit who gives life.  The flesh profits nothing.
John	006	064	But there are some of you who don't believe."  For Jesus
John	006	065	He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can
John	006	066	At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no
John	006	067	Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want
John	006	068	Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go?
John	006	069	We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ,
John	006	070	Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve,
John	006	071	Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was
John	007	001	After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't
John	007	002	Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
John	007	003	His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here,
John	007	004	For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be
John	007	005	For even his brothers didn't believe in him.
John	007	006	Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come,
John	007	007	The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify
John	007	008	You go up to the feast.  I am not yet going up to this feast,
John	007	009	Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.
John	007	010	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also
John	007	011	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said,
John	007	012	There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him.
John	007	013	Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
John	007	014	But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up
John	007	015	The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man
John	007	016	Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine,
John	007	017	If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching,
John	007	018	He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks
John	007	019	Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?
John	007	020	The multitude answered, "You have a demon!  Who seeks
John	007	021	Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel
John	007	022	Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses,
John	007	023	If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law
John	007	024	Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
John	007	025	Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this he whom
John	007	026	Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him.
John	007	027	However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes,
John	007	028	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,
John	007	029	I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."
John	007	030	They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him,
John	007	031	But of the multitude, many believed in him.  They said,
John	007	032	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things
John	007	033	Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer,
John	007	034	You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am,
John	007	035	The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this
John	007	036	What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't
John	007	037	Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and
John	007	038	He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within
John	007	039	But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him
John	007	040	Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words,
John	007	041	Others said, "This is the Christ."  But some said, "What,
John	007	042	Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed
John	007	043	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
John	007	044	Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid
John	007	045	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees,
John	007	046	The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"
John	007	047	The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also
John	007	048	Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
John	007	049	But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed."
John	007	050	Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them)
John	007	051	"Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him
John	007	052	They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee?  Search, and see
John	007	053	Everyone went to his own house,
John	008	001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John	008	002	Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple,
John	008	003	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery.
John	008	004	they told him, "Teacher, we found this woman in adultery,
John	008	005	Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such.{Leviticus 20:10;
John	008	006	They said this testing him, that they might have something
John	008	007	But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them,
John	008	008	Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John	008	009	They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience,
John	008	010	Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are
John	008	011	She said, "No one, Lord."  Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you.
John	008	012	Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light
John	008	013	The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about yourself.
John	008	014	Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony
John	008	015	You judge according to the flesh.  I judge no one.
John	008	016	Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone,
John	008	017	It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people
John	008	018	I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent
John	008	019	They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?"  Jesus answered,
John	008	020	Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple.
John	008	021	Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away,
John	008	022	The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says,
John	008	023	He said to them, "You are from beneath.  I am from above.
John	008	024	I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins;
John	008	025	They said therefore to him, "Who are you?"  Jesus said to them,
John	008	026	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you.
John	008	027	They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.
John	008	028	Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son
John	008	029	He who sent me is with me.  The Father hasn't left me alone,
John	008	030	As he spoke these things, many believed in him.
John	008	031	Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him,
John	008	032	You will know the truth, and the truth will make
John	008	033	They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been
John	008	034	Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who
John	008	035	A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever.
John	008	036	If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
John	008	037	I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me,
John	008	038	I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you
John	008	039	They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."  Jesus said to them,
John	008	040	But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth,
John	008	041	You do the works of your father."  They said to him, "We were
John	008	042	Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father,
John	008	043	Why don't you understand my speech?  Because you can't
John	008	044	You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires
John	008	045	But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
John	008	046	Which of you convicts me of sin?  If I tell the truth,
John	008	047	He who is of God hears the words of God.  For this cause you
John	008	048	Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are
John	008	049	Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father,
John	008	050	But I don't seek my own glory.  There is one who seeks and judges.
John	008	051	Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word,
John	008	052	Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon.
John	008	053	Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died?
John	008	054	Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
John	008	055	You have not known him, but I know him.  If I said, 'I don't
John	008	056	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.  He saw it,
John	008	057	The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old,
John	008	058	Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham
John	008	059	Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden,
John	009	001	As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
John	009	002	His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,
John	009	003	Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents;
John	009	004	I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day.
John	009	005	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
John	009	006	When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with
John	009	007	and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means
John	009	008	The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was
John	009	009	Others were saying, "It is he."  Still others were saying,
John	009	010	They therefore were asking him, "How were your eyes opened?"
John	009	011	He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes,
John	009	012	Then they asked him, "Where is he?"  He said, "I don't know."
John	009	013	They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
John	009	014	It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
John	009	015	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received
John	009	016	Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is
John	009	017	Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you
John	009	018	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had
John	009	019	and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
John	009	020	His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son,
John	009	021	but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened
John	009	022	His parents said these things because they feared the Jews;
John	009	023	Therefore his parents said, "He is of age.  Ask him."
John	009	024	So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him,
John	009	025	He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner.
John	009	026	They said to him again, "What did he do to you?
John	009	027	He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen.
John	009	028	They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we
John	009	029	We know that God has spoken to Moses.  But as for this man,
John	009	030	The man answered them, "How amazing!  You don't know where
John	009	031	We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone
John	009	032	Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone
John	009	033	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
John	009	034	They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins,
John	009	035	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him,
John	009	036	He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
John	009	037	Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who
John	009	038	He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him.
John	009	039	Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who
John	009	040	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things,
John	009	041	Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin;
John	010	001	"Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door
John	010	002	But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John	010	003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep
John	010	004	Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them,
John	010	005	They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him;
John	010	006	Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand
John	010	007	Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you,
John	010	008	All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
John	010	009	I am the door.  If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved,
John	010	010	The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy.
John	010	011	I am the good shepherd.{Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:11-12,15,22}
John	010	012	He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own
John	010	013	The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't
John	010	014	I am the good shepherd.  I know my own, and I'm known by my own;
John	010	015	even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father.
John	010	016	I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.{Isaiah 56:8}
John	010	017	Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,{Isaiah
John	010	018	No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself.
John	010	019	Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because
John	010	020	Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane!
John	010	021	Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon.
John	010	022	It was the Feast of the Dedication{The "Feast of the Dedication"
John	010	023	It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple,
John	010	024	The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long
John	010	025	Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe.
John	010	026	But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep,
John	010	027	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
John	010	028	I give eternal life to them.  They will never perish,
John	010	029	My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all.
John	010	030	I and the Father are one."
John	010	031	Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John	010	032	Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from
John	010	033	The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work,
John	010	034	Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said,
John	010	035	If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came
John	010	036	do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,
John	010	037	If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.
John	010	038	But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works;
John	010	039	They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
John	010	040	He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John
John	010	041	Many came to him.  They said, "John indeed did no sign,
John	010	042	Many believed in him there.
John	011	001	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village
John	011	002	It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment,
John	011	003	The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for
John	011	004	But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to death,
John	011	005	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John	011	006	When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days
John	011	007	Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let's go
John	011	008	The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying
John	011	009	Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight?
John	011	010	But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light
John	011	011	He said these things, and after that, he said to them,
John	011	012	The disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep,
John	011	013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke
John	011	014	So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.
John	011	015	I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you

John	011	017	So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb
John	011	018	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia{15 stadia
John	011	019	Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary,
John	011	020	Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him,
John	011	021	Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here,
John	011	022	Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
John	011	023	Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
John	011	024	Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the
John	011	025	Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
John	011	026	Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.
John	011	027	She said to him, "Yes, Lord.  I have come to believe that you
John	011	028	When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary,
John	011	029	When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
John	011	030	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place
John	011	031	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her,
John	011	032	Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him,
John	011	033	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping
John	011	034	and said, "Where have you laid him?"  They told him, "Lord,
John	011	035	Jesus wept.
John	011	036	The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for him!"
John	011	037	Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes
John	011	038	Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb.
John	011	039	Jesus said, "Take away the stone."  Martha, the sister of him
John	011	040	Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed,
John	011	041	So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man
John	011	042	I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude
John	011	043	When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,
John	011	044	He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings,
John	011	045	Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did,
John	011	046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them
John	011	047	The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council,
John	011	048	If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him,
John	011	049	But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year,
John	011	050	nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man

John	011	052	and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather
John	011	053	So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put

John	011	055	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand.  Many went
John	011	056	Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another,
John	011	057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded
John	012	001	Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany,
John	012	002	So they made him a supper there.  Martha served, but Lazarus

John	012	006	Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor,

John	012	011	because on account of him many of the Jews went away and
John	012	012	On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast.
John	012	013	they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to

John	012	040	"He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they
John	012	041	Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke
John	012	042	Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him,
John	012	043	for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.
John	012	044	Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not
John	012	045	He who sees me sees him who sent me.
John	012	046	I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes
John	012	047	If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe,
John	012	048	He who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one

John	013	001	Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time
John	013	002	After supper, the devil having already put into the heart
John	013	003	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,
John	013	004	arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments.
John	013	005	Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash
John	013	006	Then he came to Simon Peter.  He said to him, "Lord, do you
John	013	007	Jesus answered him, "You don't know what I am doing now,
John	013	008	Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!"

John	013	012	So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on,
John	013	013	You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly,
John	013	014	If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet,
John	013	015	For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I
John	013	016	Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord,
John	013	017	If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
John	013	018	I don't speak concerning all of you.  I know whom I have chosen.
John	013	019	From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens,
John	013	020	Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send,
John	013	021	When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified,
John	013	022	The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.
John	013	023	One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table,
John	013	024	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him,
John	013	025	He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him,
John	013	026	Jesus therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will

John	013	028	Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
John	013	029	For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus
John	013	030	Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately.
John	013	031	When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has
John	013	032	If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him
John	013	033	Little children, I will be with you a little while longer.
John	013	034	A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another,
John	013	035	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you
John	013	036	Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?"
John	013	037	Peter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now?
John	013	038	Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me?
John	014	001	"Don't let your heart be troubled.  Believe in God.
John	014	002	In my Father's house are many homes.  If it weren't so,
John	014	003	If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
John	014	004	Where I go, you know, and you know the way."
John	014	005	Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going.
John	014	006	Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
John	014	007	If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
John	014	008	Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will
John	014	009	Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do
John	014	010	Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
John	014	011	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me;

John	014	013	Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father
John	014	014	If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
John	014	015	If you love me, keep my commandments.
John	014	016	I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another
John	014	017	the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive;
John	014	018	I will not leave you orphans.  I will come to you.
John	014	019	Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more;
John	014	020	In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me,
John	014	021	One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one
John	014	022	Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened that you

John	014	028	You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.'
John	014	029	Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens,
John	014	030	I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes,
John	014	031	But that the world may know that I love the Father,
John	015	001	"I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
John	015	002	Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away.
John	015	003	You are already pruned clean because of the word which I
John	015	004	Remain in me, and I in you.  As the branch can't bear fruit
John	015	005	I am the vine.  You are the branches.  He who remains in me,
John	015	006	If a man doesn't remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch,
John	015	007	If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask
John	015	008	"In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit;
John	015	009	Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you.
John	015	010	If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love;

John	015	018	If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before
John	015	019	If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
John	015	020	Remember the word that I said to you:  'A servant is not

John	015	022	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin;
John	015	023	He who hates me, hates my Father also.
John	015	024	If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did,

John	016	009	about sin, because they don't believe in me;
John	016	010	about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you

John	016	019	Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said

John	016	021	A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come.
John	016	022	Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again,

John	016	024	Until now, you have asked nothing in my name.  Ask, and you
John	016	025	I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech.
John	016	026	In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you,
John	016	027	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me,

John	016	033	I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace.

John	017	003	This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God,

John	017	005	Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory
John	017	006	I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out
John	017	007	Now they have known that all things whatever you have given
John	017	008	for the words which you have given me I have given to them,
John	017	009	I pray for them.  I don't pray for the world, but for those whom
John	017	010	All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine,
John	017	011	I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
John	017	012	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name.
John	017	013	But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world,
John	017	014	I have given them your word.  The world hated them, because they

John	017	018	As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them
John	017	019	For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves

John	018	003	Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers
John	018	004	Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him,
John	018	005	They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth."  Jesus said to them,
John	018	006	When therefore he said to them, "I am he," they went backward,

John	018	021	Why do you ask me?  Ask those who have heard me what I said
John	018	022	When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped

John	018	025	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.  They said
John	018	026	One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative
John	018	027	Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
John	018	028	They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium.
John	018	029	Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation

John	018	038	Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"  When he had said this,
John	018	039	But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you

John	019	015	They cried out, "Away with him!  Away with him!  Crucify him!"
John	019	016	So then he delivered him to them to be crucified.
John	019	017	He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called "The Place
John	019	018	where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either

John	019	020	Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place
John	019	021	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write,
John	019	022	Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
John	019	023	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments
John	019	024	Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots

John	019	026	Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom

John	019	034	However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,
John	019	035	He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true.
John	019	036	For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
John	019	037	Again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom
John	019	038	After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple
John	019	039	Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came
John	019	040	So they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with
John	019	041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.
John	019	042	Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was

John	020	004	They both ran together.  The other disciple outran Peter,
John	020	005	Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying,

John	020	007	and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with
John	020	008	So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also
John	020	009	For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise
John	020	010	So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
John	020	011	But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping.  So, as she wept,
John	020	012	and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head,
John	020	013	They told her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"  She said to them,
John	020	014	When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing,
John	020	015	Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?
John	020	016	Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rhabbouni!"

John	021	014	This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples,
John	021	015	So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to

Acts	001	015	In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
Acts	001	016	"Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled,

Acts	002	003	Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them,
Acts	002	004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak
Acts	002	005	Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
Acts	002	006	When this sound was heard, the multitude came together,
Acts	002	007	They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another,
Acts	002	008	How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
Acts	002	009	Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia,
Acts	002	010	Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene,
Acts	002	011	Cretans and Arabians:  we hear them speaking in our languages
Acts	002	012	They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another,
Acts	002	013	Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."
Acts	002	014	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
Acts	002	015	For these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only
Acts	002	016	But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:

Acts	002	041	Then those who gladly received his word were baptized.
Acts	002	042	They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship,
Acts	002	043	Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done
Acts	002	044	All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
Acts	002	045	They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them

Acts	003	001	Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer,
Acts	003	002	A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried,
Acts	003	003	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked
Acts	003	004	Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, "Look at us."
Acts	003	005	He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts	003	006	But Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have,
Acts	003	007	He took him by the right hand, and raised him up.
Acts	003	008	Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk.  He entered with them
Acts	003	009	All the people saw him walking and praising God.
Acts	003	010	They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging
Acts	003	011	As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John,
Acts	003	012	When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, "You men of Israel,
Acts	003	013	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers,

Acts	003	020	and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,

Acts	004	020	for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."
Acts	004	021	When they had further threatened them, they let them go,
Acts	004	022	For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed
Acts	004	023	Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported
Acts	004	024	When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with
Acts	004	025	who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do

Acts	004	031	When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
Acts	004	032	The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul.
Acts	004	033	With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the

Acts	005	002	and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it,
Acts	005	003	But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart
Acts	005	004	While you kept it, didn't it remain your own?
Acts	005	005	Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died.
Acts	005	006	The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him
Acts	005	007	About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what

Acts	005	009	But Peter asked her, "How is it that you have agreed

Acts	005	011	Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who
Acts	005	012	By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among
Acts	005	013	None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.
Acts	005	014	More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both

Acts	005	016	Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem,
Acts	005	017	But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him
Acts	005	018	and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.
Acts	005	019	But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night,
Acts	005	020	"Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
Acts	005	021	When they heard this, they entered into the temple
Acts	005	022	But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison.

Acts	005	027	When they had brought them, they set them before the council.
Acts	005	028	saying, "Didn't we strictly charge you not to teach in this name?
Acts	005	029	But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God

Acts	006	009	But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines,"

Acts	018	011	He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word
Acts	018	012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord
Acts	018	013	saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary
Acts	018	014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to
Acts	018	015	but if they are questions about words and names and your own law,
Acts	018	016	He drove them from the judgment seat.
Acts	018	017	Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler
Acts	018	018	Paul, having stayed after this many more days,
Acts	018	019	He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself
Acts	018	020	When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;
Acts	018	021	but taking his leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means

Acts	018	023	Having spent some time there, he departed, and went

Acts	018	025	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
Acts	018	026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.  But when Priscilla
Acts	018	027	When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers

Acts	019	001	It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul,
Acts	019	002	He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"
Acts	019	003	He said, "Into what then were you baptized?"  They said,
Acts	019	004	Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance,
Acts	019	005	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of
Acts	019	006	When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them,
Acts	019	007	They were about twelve men in all.
Acts	019	008	He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period
Acts	019	009	But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of
Acts	019	010	This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia
Acts	019	011	God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,
Acts	019	012	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from
Acts	019	013	But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves
Acts	019	014	There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest,
Acts	019	015	The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know,
Acts	019	016	The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them,
Acts	019	017	This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus.
Acts	019	018	Many also of those who had believed came, confessing,
Acts	019	019	Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their
Acts	019	020	So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.
Acts	019	021	Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit,
Acts	019	022	Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him,
Acts	019	023	About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
Acts	019	024	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made
Acts	019	025	whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation,
Acts	019	026	You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout
Acts	019	027	Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute,
Acts	019	028	When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out,
Acts	019	029	The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one
Acts	019	030	When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples
Acts	019	031	Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him
Acts	019	032	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the
Acts	019	033	They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
Acts	019	034	But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice
Acts	019	035	When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men
Acts	019	036	Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought
Acts	019	037	For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers
Acts	019	038	If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him
Acts	019	039	But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled
Acts	019	040	For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this
Acts	019	041	When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Acts	020	001	After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples,
Acts	020	002	When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them
Acts	020	003	When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made
Acts	020	004	These accompanied him as far as Asia:  Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus
Acts	020	005	But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts	020	006	We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread,
Acts	020	007	On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered
Acts	020	008	There were many lights in the upper chamber where we{TR reads "they"
Acts	020	009	A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window,
Acts	020	010	Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said,
Acts	020	011	When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten,
Acts	020	012	They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.
Acts	020	013	But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos,
Acts	020	014	When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.
Acts	020	015	Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios.
Acts	020	016	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not
Acts	020	017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders
Acts	020	018	When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know,
Acts	020	019	serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears,
Acts	020	020	how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that
Acts	020	021	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God,
Acts	020	022	Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing
Acts	020	023	except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city,
Acts	020	024	But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself,
Acts	020	025	"Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about
Acts	020	026	Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from
Acts	020	027	for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
Acts	020	028	Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock,
Acts	020	029	For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter
Acts	020	030	Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things,
Acts	020	031	Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years
Acts	020	032	Now, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where the context
Acts	020	033	I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
Acts	020	034	You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities,
Acts	020	035	In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought
Acts	020	036	When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed
Acts	020	037	They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,
Acts	020	038	sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken,
Acts	021	001	When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail,
Acts	021	002	Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard,
Acts	021	003	When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand,
Acts	021	004	Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days.
Acts	021	005	When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed
Acts	021	006	After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship,
Acts	021	007	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais.
Acts	021	008	On the next day, we, who were Paul's companions, departed, and came
Acts	021	009	Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
Acts	021	010	As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus
Acts	021	011	Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet
Acts	021	012	When we heard these things, both we and they of that place
Acts	021	013	Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking
Acts	021	014	When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Lord's
Acts	021	015	After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts	021	016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us,
Acts	021	017	When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
Acts	021	018	The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all
Acts	021	019	When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things
Acts	021	020	They, when they heard it, glorified God.  They said to him,
Acts	021	021	They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews
Acts	021	022	What then?  The assembly must certainly meet, for they will
Acts	021	023	Therefore do what we tell you.  We have four men who have
Acts	021	024	Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their
Acts	021	025	But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our
Acts	021	026	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself
Acts	021	027	When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia,
Acts	021	028	crying out, "Men of Israel, help!  This is the man who teaches all
Acts	021	029	For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city,
Acts	021	030	All the city was moved, and the people ran together.
Acts	021	031	As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding
Acts	021	032	Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them.
Acts	021	033	Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him,
Acts	021	034	Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd.
Acts	021	035	When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried
Acts	021	036	for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out,
Acts	021	037	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks,
Acts	021	038	Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up
Acts	021	039	But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen
Acts	021	040	When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs,
Acts	022	001	"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now
Acts	022	002	When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language,
Acts	022	003	"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up
Acts	022	004	I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering
Acts	022	005	As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify,
Acts	022	006	It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close
Acts	022	007	I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul,
Acts	022	008	I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?'  He said to me, 'I am Jesus
Acts	022	009	"Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid,

Acts	022	011	When I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led
Acts	022	012	One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported
Acts	022	013	came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul,
Acts	022	014	He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know
Acts	022	015	For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you
Acts	022	016	Now why do you wait?  Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins,
Acts	022	017	"It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I
Acts	022	018	and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly,
Acts	022	019	I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat
Acts	022	020	When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also
Acts	022	021	"He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here

Acts	022	023	As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust
Acts	022	024	the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks,
Acts	022	025	When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion
Acts	022	026	When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer
Acts	022	027	The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you
Acts	022	028	The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship
Acts	022	029	Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him,
Acts	022	030	But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was
Acts	023	001	Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have
Acts	023	002	The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him
Acts	023	003	Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!
Acts	023	004	Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"
Acts	023	005	Paul said, "I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest.
Acts	023	006	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees
Acts	023	007	When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees
Acts	023	008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel,
Acts	023	009	A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part
Acts	023	010	When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that
Acts	023	011	The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said,
Acts	023	012	When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound
Acts	023	013	There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
Acts	023	014	They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said,
Acts	023	015	Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding
Acts	023	016	But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait,
Acts	023	017	Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this
Acts	023	018	So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer,
Acts	023	019	The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside,
Acts	023	020	He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul
Acts	023	021	Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie
Acts	023	022	So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him,
Acts	023	023	He called to himself two of the centurions, and said,
Acts	023	024	He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one,
Acts	023	025	He wrote a letter like this:
Acts	023	026	"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix:  Greetings.
Acts	023	027	"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed
Acts	023	028	Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought
Acts	023	029	I found him to be accused about questions of their law,
Acts	023	030	When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent
Acts	023	031	So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought
Acts	023	032	But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him,
Acts	023	033	When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor,
Acts	023	034	When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from.
Acts	023	035	"I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive."
Acts	024	001	After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down
Acts	024	002	When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,
Acts	024	003	we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix,
Acts	024	004	But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us
Acts	024	005	For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator
Acts	024	006	He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.{TR
Acts	024	007	{TR adds "but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with

Acts	024	009	The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these
Acts	024	010	When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered,
Acts	024	011	seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve
Acts	024	012	In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring
Acts	024	013	Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
Acts	024	014	But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call
Acts	024	015	having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for,
Acts	024	016	Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense
Acts	024	017	Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy
Acts	024	018	amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple,
Acts	024	019	They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation,
Acts	024	020	Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found
Acts	024	021	unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them,
Acts	024	022	But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way,
Acts	024	023	He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody,
Acts	024	024	But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife,
Acts	024	025	As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the
Acts	024	026	Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul,
Acts	024	027	But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by
Acts	025	001	Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days
Acts	025	002	Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed
Acts	025	003	asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem;
Acts	025	004	However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody
Acts	025	005	"Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you
Acts	025	006	When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down
Acts	025	007	When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem
Acts	025	008	while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law
Acts	025	009	But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul
Acts	025	010	But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat,
Acts	025	011	For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy
Acts	025	012	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
Acts	025	013	Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice
Acts	025	014	As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before
Acts	025	015	about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders
Acts	025	016	To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans
Acts	025	017	When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay,
Acts	025	018	Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought
Acts	025	019	but had certain questions against him about their own religion,
Acts	025	020	Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things,
Acts	025	021	But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of
Acts	025	022	Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself."
Acts	025	023	So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with
Acts	025	024	Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present
Acts	025	025	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
Acts	025	026	Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord.
Acts	025	027	For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner,
Acts	026	001	Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself."
Acts	026	002	"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my

Acts	026	005	having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify,

Acts	026	007	which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day,

Acts	026	015	"I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'  "He said, 'I am Jesus,

Acts	026	019	"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to

Acts	027	035	When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God
Acts	027	036	Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
Acts	027	037	In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.
Acts	027	038	When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship,

Acts	028	005	However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.

Acts	028	013	From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium.

Acts	028	015	From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet
Acts	028	016	When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
Acts	028	017	It happened that after three days Paul called together those who
Acts	028	018	who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free,
Acts	028	019	But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained
Acts	028	020	For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you.

Acts	028	031	preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning
Romans	001	001	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
Romans	001	002	which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans	001	003	concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according
Romans	001	004	who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
Romans	001	005	through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience
Romans	001	006	among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;
Romans	001	007	to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
Romans	001	008	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
Romans	001	009	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News
Romans	001	010	requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered
Romans	001	011	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift,
Romans	001	012	that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us
Romans	001	013	Now I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I
Romans	001	014	I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise
Romans	001	015	So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News
Romans	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is
Romans	001	017	For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith.
Romans	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
Romans	001	019	because that which is known of God is revealed in them,
Romans	001	020	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world
Romans	001	021	Because, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God,
Romans	001	022	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
Romans	001	023	and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an
Romans	001	024	Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their
Romans	001	025	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped
Romans	001	026	For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions.
Romans	001	027	Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman,
Romans	001	028	Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge,
Romans	001	029	being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality,
Romans	001	030	backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful,
Romans	001	031	without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural
Romans	001	032	who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice
Romans	002	001	Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge.
Romans	002	002	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against
Romans	002	003	Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things,
Romans	002	004	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance,
Romans	002	005	But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you
Romans	002	006	who "will pay back to everyone according to their
Romans	002	007	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor,
Romans	002	008	but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth,
Romans	002	009	oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil,
Romans	002	010	But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good,
Romans	002	011	For there is no partiality with God.
Romans	002	012	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without
Romans	002	013	For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God,
Romans	002	014	(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things
Romans	002	015	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts,
Romans	002	016	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to
Romans	002	017	Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law,
Romans	002	018	and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent,
Romans	002	019	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind,
Romans	002	020	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in
Romans	002	021	You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself?
Romans	002	022	You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery.  Do you commit adultery?
Romans	002	023	You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law
Romans	002	024	For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because
Romans	002	025	For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law,
Romans	002	026	If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law,
Romans	002	027	Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills
Romans	002	028	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that
Romans	002	029	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision
Romans	003	001	Then what advantage does the Jew have?  Or what is the
Romans	003	002	Much in every way!  Because first of all, they were entrusted
Romans	003	003	For what if some were without faith?  Will their lack of faith
Romans	003	004	May it never be!  Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar.
Romans	003	005	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God,
Romans	003	006	May it never be!  For then how will God judge the world?
Romans	003	007	For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory,
Romans	003	008	Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm
Romans	003	009	What then?  Are we better than they?  No, in no way.
Romans	003	010	As it is written, "There is no one righteous; no, not one.
Romans	003	011	There is no one who understands.  There is no one who
Romans	003	012	They have all turned aside.  They have together become unprofitable.
Romans	003	013	"Their throat is an open tomb.  With their tongues they
Romans	003	014	"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."{Psalm 10:7}
Romans	003	015	"Their feet are swift to shed blood.
Romans	003	016	Destruction and misery are in their ways.
Romans	003	017	The way of peace, they haven't known."{Isaiah 59:7-8}
Romans	003	018	"There is no fear of God before their eyes."{Psalm 36:1}
Romans	003	019	Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to
Romans	003	020	Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified
Romans	003	021	But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has
Romans	003	022	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
Romans	003	023	for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;
Romans	003	024	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
Romans	003	025	whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice{or, a propitiation},
Romans	003	026	to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time;
Romans	003	027	Where then is the boasting?  It is excluded.  By what manner of law?
Romans	003	028	We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart
Romans	003	029	Or is God the God of Jews only?  Isn't he the God of Gentiles also?
Romans	003	030	since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised
Romans	003	031	Do we then nullify the law through faith?  May it never be!
Romans	004	001	What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found
Romans	004	002	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something
Romans	004	003	For what does the Scripture say?  "Abraham believed God,
Romans	004	004	Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace,
Romans	004	005	But to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies
Romans	004	006	Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God
Romans	004	007	"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
Romans	004	008	Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge
Romans	004	009	Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on
Romans	004	010	How then was it counted?  When he was in circumcision,
Romans	004	011	He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
Romans	004	012	The father of circumcision to those who not only are of
Romans	004	013	For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should
Romans	004	014	For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void,
Romans	004	015	For the law works wrath, for where there is no law,
Romans	004	016	For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace,
Romans	004	017	As it is written, "I have made you a father of many nations."{Genesis
Romans	004	018	Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might
Romans	004	019	Without being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body,
Romans	004	020	Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief,
Romans	004	021	and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able
Romans	004	022	Therefore it also was "reckoned to him for righteousness."{Genesis
Romans	004	023	Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for
Romans	004	024	but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe
Romans	004	025	who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised
Romans	005	001	Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God
Romans	005	002	through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace
Romans	005	003	Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings,
Romans	005	004	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:
Romans	005	005	and hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been
Romans	005	006	For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died
Romans	005	007	For one will hardly die for a righteous man.  Yet perhaps
Romans	005	008	But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we
Romans	005	009	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be
Romans	005	010	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
Romans	005	011	Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans	005	012	Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man,
Romans	005	013	For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged
Romans	005	014	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses,
Romans	005	015	But the free gift isn't like the trespass.  For if by the trespass
Romans	005	016	The gift is not as through one who sinned:  for the judgment
Romans	005	017	For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one;
Romans	005	018	So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned;
Romans	005	019	For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners,
Romans	005	020	The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound;
Romans	005	021	that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through
Romans	006	001	What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin,
Romans	006	002	May it never be!  We who died to sin, how could we live
Romans	006	003	Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus
Romans	006	004	We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death,
Romans	006	005	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,
Romans	006	006	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him,
Romans	006	007	For he who has died has been freed from sin.
Romans	006	008	But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also
Romans	006	009	knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more.
Romans	006	010	For the death that he died, he died to sin one time;
Romans	006	011	Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive
Romans	006	012	Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you
Romans	006	013	Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness,
Romans	006	014	For sin will not have dominion over you.  For you are not under law,
Romans	006	015	What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under law,
Romans	006	016	Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as
Romans	006	017	But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin,
Romans	006	018	Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.
Romans	006	019	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh,
Romans	006	020	For when you were servants of sin, you were free in
Romans	006	021	What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which
Romans	006	022	But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants
Romans	006	023	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
Romans	007	001	Or don't you know, brothers{The word for "brothers"
Romans	007	002	For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband
Romans	007	003	So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man,
Romans	007	004	Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law
Romans	007	005	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which
Romans	007	006	But now we have been discharged from the law, having died
Romans	007	007	What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  May it never be!
Romans	007	008	But sin, finding occasion through the commandment,
Romans	007	009	I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came,
Romans	007	010	The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;
Romans	007	011	for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me,
Romans	007	012	Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy,
Romans	007	013	Did then that which is good become death to me?  May it never be!
Romans	007	014	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly,
Romans	007	015	For I don't know what I am doing.  For I don't practice what I
Romans	007	016	But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law
Romans	007	017	So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
Romans	007	018	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing.
Romans	007	019	For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I
Romans	007	020	But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it,
Romans	007	021	I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good,
Romans	007	022	For I delight in God's law after the inward man,
Romans	007	023	but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law
Romans	007	024	What a wretched man I am!  Who will deliver me out of the body
Romans	007	025	I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!  So then with the mind,
Romans	008	001	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are
Romans	008	002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free
Romans	008	003	For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
Romans	008	004	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us,
Romans	008	005	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds
Romans	008	006	For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit
Romans	008	007	because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God;
Romans	008	008	Those who are in the flesh can't please God.
Romans	008	009	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so
Romans	008	010	If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin,
Romans	008	011	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead
Romans	008	012	So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
Romans	008	013	For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit
Romans	008	014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are
Romans	008	015	For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear,
Romans	008	016	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are
Romans	008	017	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs
Romans	008	018	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time
Romans	008	019	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children
Romans	008	020	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will,
Romans	008	021	that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage
Romans	008	022	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain
Romans	008	023	Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits
Romans	008	024	For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope.
Romans	008	025	But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for
Romans	008	026	In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we
Romans	008	027	He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind,
Romans	008	028	We know that all things work together for good for those who
Romans	008	029	For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed
Romans	008	030	Whom he predestined, those he also called.
Romans	008	031	What then shall we say about these things?  If God is for us,
Romans	008	032	He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
Romans	008	033	Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones?
Romans	008	034	Who is he who condemns?  It is Christ who died, yes rather,
Romans	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Could oppression,
Romans	008	036	Even as it is written, "For your sake we are killed all day long.
Romans	008	037	No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through
Romans	008	038	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
Romans	008	039	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing,
Romans	009	001	I tell the truth in Christ.  I am not lying, my conscience
Romans	009	002	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans	009	003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ
Romans	009	004	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants,
Romans	009	005	of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning
Romans	009	006	But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing.
Romans	009	007	Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children.
Romans	009	008	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children
Romans	009	009	For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come,
Romans	009	010	Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
Romans	009	011	For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad,
Romans	009	012	it was said to her, "The elder will serve the younger."{Genesis 25:23}
Romans	009	013	Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."{Malachi
Romans	009	014	What shall we say then?  Is there unrighteousness
Romans	009	015	For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
Romans	009	016	So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs,
Romans	009	017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I
Romans	009	018	So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens
Romans	009	019	You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault?

Romans	009	024	us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also
Romans	009	025	As he says also in Hosea, "I will call them 'my people,'

Romans	009	029	As Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth
Romans	009	030	What shall we say then?  That the Gentiles, who didn't
Romans	009	031	but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive
Romans	009	032	Why?  Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were
Romans	009	033	even as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling
Romans	010	001	Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel,
Romans	010	002	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God,
Romans	010	003	For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking
Romans	010	004	For Christ is the fulfillment{or, completion, or end} of the law
Romans	010	005	For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one

Romans	010	010	For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness;
Romans	010	011	For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not

Romans	010	014	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
Romans	010	015	And how will they preach unless they are sent?  As it is written:
Romans	010	016	But they didn't all listen to the glad news.  For Isaiah says,
Romans	010	017	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Romans	010	018	But I say, didn't they hear?  Yes, most certainly, "Their sound
Romans	010	019	But I ask, didn't Israel know?  First Moses says, "I will provoke
Romans	010	020	Isaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who

Romans	011	001	I ask then, did God reject his people?  May it never be!
Romans	011	002	God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew.  Or don't you
Romans	011	003	"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken
Romans	011	004	But how does God answer him?  "I have reserved for myself seven
Romans	011	005	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
Romans	011	006	And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace
Romans	011	007	What then?  That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain,
Romans	011	008	According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor,
Romans	011	009	David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
Romans	011	010	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.
Romans	011	011	I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?  May it never be!
Romans	011	012	Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss
Romans	011	013	For I speak to you who are Gentiles.  Since then as I am
Romans	011	014	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh,
Romans	011	015	For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world,
Romans	011	016	If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump.  If the root is holy,
Romans	011	017	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a

Romans	011	019	You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might
Romans	011	020	True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand
Romans	011	021	for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will
Romans	011	022	See then the goodness and severity of God.  Toward those
Romans	011	023	They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be

Romans	011	026	and so all Israel will be saved.  Even as it is written,
Romans	011	027	This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their
Romans	011	028	Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake.
Romans	011	029	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans	011	030	For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have
Romans	011	031	even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy
Romans	011	032	For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have
Romans	011	033	Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge
Romans	011	034	"For who has known the mind of the Lord?  Or who has been
Romans	011	035	"Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to
Romans	011	036	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things.
Romans	012	001	Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present
Romans	012	002	Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
Romans	012	003	For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every
Romans	012	004	For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members
Romans	012	005	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually
Romans	012	006	Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us,
Romans	012	007	or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches,
Romans	012	008	or he who exhorts, to his exhorting:  he who gives,
Romans	012	009	Let love be without hypocrisy.  Abhor that which is evil.
Romans	012	010	In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another;
Romans	012	011	not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Romans	012	012	rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly
Romans	012	013	contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.
Romans	012	014	Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.
Romans	012	015	Rejoice with those who rejoice.  Weep with those who weep.
Romans	012	016	Be of the same mind one toward another.  Don't set your
Romans	012	017	Repay no one evil for evil.  Respect what is honorable
Romans	012	018	If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace
Romans	012	019	Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to
Romans	012	020	Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him.  If he is thirsty,
Romans	012	021	Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans	013	001	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities,
Romans	013	002	Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance
Romans	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.
Romans	013	004	for he is a servant of God to you for good.  But if you do that
Romans	013	005	Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of
Romans	013	006	For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants
Romans	013	007	Give therefore to everyone what you owe:  taxes to whom taxes
Romans	013	008	Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves
Romans	013	009	For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery,"
Romans	013	010	Love doesn't harm a neighbor.  Love therefore is the fulfillment
Romans	013	011	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you
Romans	013	012	The night is far gone, and the day is near.  Let's therefore throw
Romans	013	013	Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling
Romans	013	014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision
Romans	014	001	Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes
Romans	014	002	One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak
Romans	014	003	Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat.
Romans	014	004	Who are you who judge another's servant?  To his own lord
Romans	014	005	One man esteems one day as more important.  Another esteems every
Romans	014	006	He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does
Romans	014	007	For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.
Romans	014	008	For if we live, we live to the Lord.  Or if we die, we die
Romans	014	009	For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again,
Romans	014	010	But you, why do you judge your brother?  Or you again,
Romans	014	011	For it is written, "'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee
Romans	014	012	So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.
Romans	014	013	Therefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather,
Romans	014	014	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is
Romans	014	015	Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk
Romans	014	016	Then don't let your good be slandered,
Romans	014	017	for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking,
Romans	014	018	For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God
Romans	014	019	So then, let us follow after things which make for peace,
Romans	014	020	Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake.  All things indeed
Romans	014	021	It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything
Romans	014	022	Do you have faith?  Have it to yourself before God.
Romans	014	023	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it
Romans	015	001	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak,
Romans	015	002	Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good,
Romans	015	003	For even Christ didn't please himself.  But, as it is written,
Romans	015	004	For whatever things were written before were written for
Romans	015	005	Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be
Romans	015	006	that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God
Romans	015	007	Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted
Romans	015	008	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision
Romans	015	009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.
Romans	015	010	Again he says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."{Deuteronomy
Romans	015	011	Again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!  Let all the peoples
Romans	015	012	Again, Isaiah says, "There will be the root of Jesse,
Romans	015	013	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
Romans	015	014	I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers{The word
Romans	015	015	But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you,
Romans	015	016	that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles,
Romans	015	017	I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things
Romans	015	018	For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which
Romans	015	019	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit;
Romans	015	020	yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ
Romans	015	021	But, as it is written, "They will see, to whom no news of him came.
Romans	015	022	Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,
Romans	015	023	but now, no longer having any place in these regions,
Romans	015	024	whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you.
Romans	015	025	But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
Romans	015	026	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia
Romans	015	027	Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors.
Romans	015	028	When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed
Romans	015	029	I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness
Romans	015	030	Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by
Romans	015	031	that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea,
Romans	015	032	that I may come to you in joy through the will of God,
Romans	015	033	Now the God of peace be with you all.  Amen.
Romans	016	001	I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant{or,
Romans	016	002	that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints,
Romans	016	003	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans	016	004	who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I

Romans	016	006	Greet Mary, who labored much for us.
Romans	016	007	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners,
Romans	016	008	Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
Romans	016	009	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
Romans	016	010	Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ.  Greet those who are

Romans	016	014	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the

Romans	016	016	Greet one another with a holy kiss.  The assemblies of
Romans	016	017	Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing
Romans	016	018	For those who are such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ,
Romans	016	019	For your obedience has become known to all.  I rejoice therefore
Romans	016	020	And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet.
Romans	016	021	Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason,
Romans	016	022	I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.
Romans	016	023	Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you.

1 Corinthians	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians	001	004	I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God
1 Corinthians	001	005	that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech
1 Corinthians	001	006	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians	001	007	so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation
1 Corinthians	001	008	who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day
1 Corinthians	001	009	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship
1 Corinthians	001	010	Now I beg you, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and
1 Corinthians	001	011	For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers,
1 Corinthians	001	012	Now I mean this, that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," "I
1 Corinthians	001	013	Is Christ divided?  Was Paul crucified for you?
1 Corinthians	001	014	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
1 Corinthians	001	015	so that no one should say that I had baptized you into
1 Corinthians	001	016	(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them,
1 Corinthians	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News--
1 Corinthians	001	018	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying,
1 Corinthians	001	019	For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will
1 Corinthians	001	020	Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the lawyer
1 Corinthians	001	021	For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its
1 Corinthians	001	022	For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,
1 Corinthians	001	023	but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews,
1 Corinthians	001	024	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is
1 Corinthians	001	025	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness
1 Corinthians	001	026	For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise
1 Corinthians	001	027	but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put
1 Corinthians	001	028	and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things
1 Corinthians	001	029	that no flesh should boast before God.
1 Corinthians	001	030	But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom
1 Corinthians	001	031	that, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him
1 Corinthians	002	001	When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence
1 Corinthians	002	002	For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ,
1 Corinthians	002	003	I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
1 Corinthians	002	004	My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of
1 Corinthians	002	005	that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men,
1 Corinthians	002	006	We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown;
1 Corinthians	002	007	But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has
1 Corinthians	002	008	which none of the rulers of this world has known.  For had they
1 Corinthians	002	009	But as it is written, "Things which an eye didn't see,
1 Corinthians	002	010	But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit.
1 Corinthians	002	011	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit
1 Corinthians	002	012	But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit
1 Corinthians	002	013	Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches,
1 Corinthians	002	014	Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit,
1 Corinthians	002	015	But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself
1 Corinthians	002	016	"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct
1 Corinthians	003	001	Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly,
1 Corinthians	003	002	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready.
1 Corinthians	003	003	for you are still fleshly.  For insofar as there is jealousy,
1 Corinthians	003	004	For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos,"
1 Corinthians	003	005	Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom
1 Corinthians	003	006	I planted.  Apollos watered.  But God gave the increase.
1 Corinthians	003	007	So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters,
1 Corinthians	003	008	Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each
1 Corinthians	003	009	For we are God's fellow workers.  You are God's farming,
1 Corinthians	003	010	According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise
1 Corinthians	003	011	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has
1 Corinthians	003	012	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
1 Corinthians	003	013	each man's work will be revealed.  For the Day will declare it,
1 Corinthians	003	014	If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will
1 Corinthians	003	015	If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself
1 Corinthians	003	016	Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit
1 Corinthians	003	017	If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him;
1 Corinthians	003	018	Let no one deceive himself.  If anyone thinks that he is
1 Corinthians	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it
1 Corinthians	003	020	And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it
1 Corinthians	003	021	Therefore let no one boast in men.  For all things are yours,
1 Corinthians	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world,
1 Corinthians	003	023	and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
1 Corinthians	004	001	So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards
1 Corinthians	004	002	Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they
1 Corinthians	004	003	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
1 Corinthians	004	004	For I know nothing against myself.  Yet I am not justified
1 Corinthians	004	005	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes,
1 Corinthians	004	006	Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred
1 Corinthians	004	007	For who makes you different?  And what do you have that you
1 Corinthians	004	008	You are already filled.  You have already become rich.
1 Corinthians	004	009	For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all,
1 Corinthians	004	010	We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ.
1 Corinthians	004	011	Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked,
1 Corinthians	004	012	We toil, working with our own hands.  When people curse us, we bless.
1 Corinthians	004	013	Being defamed, we entreat.  We are made as the filth of the world,
1 Corinthians	004	014	I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you
1 Corinthians	004	015	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not
1 Corinthians	004	016	I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.
1 Corinthians	004	017	Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my
1 Corinthians	004	018	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
1 Corinthians	004	019	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing.
1 Corinthians	004	020	For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1 Corinthians	004	021	What do you want?  Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love
1 Corinthians	005	001	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you,
1 Corinthians	005	002	You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had
1 Corinthians	005	003	For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present
1 Corinthians	005	004	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together,
1 Corinthians	005	005	are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
1 Corinthians	005	006	Your boasting is not good.  Don't you know that a little yeast
1 Corinthians	005	007	Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump,
1 Corinthians	005	008	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast,
1 Corinthians	005	009	I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
1 Corinthians	005	010	yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world,
1 Corinthians	005	011	But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone
1 Corinthians	005	012	For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside?
1 Corinthians	005	013	But those who are outside, God judges.  "Put away the wicked man
1 Corinthians	006	001	Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor,
1 Corinthians	006	002	Don't you know that the saints will judge the world?
1 Corinthians	006	003	Don't you know that we will judge angels?  How much more,
1 Corinthians	006	004	If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life,
1 Corinthians	006	005	I say this to move you to shame.  Isn't there even one wise man
1 Corinthians	006	006	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!
1 Corinthians	006	007	Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you
1 Corinthians	006	008	No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that
1 Corinthians	006	009	Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom
1 Corinthians	006	010	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers,
1 Corinthians	006	011	Such were some of you, but you were washed.  But you were sanctified.
1 Corinthians	006	012	"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are expedient.
1 Corinthians	006	013	"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,"
1 Corinthians	006	014	Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up
1 Corinthians	006	015	Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then
1 Corinthians	006	016	Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body?
1 Corinthians	006	017	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians	006	018	Flee sexual immorality!  "Every sin that a man does is outside
1 Corinthians	006	019	Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
1 Corinthians	006	020	for you were bought with a price.  Therefore glorify God
1 Corinthians	007	001	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me:
1 Corinthians	007	002	But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his
1 Corinthians	007	003	Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her,
1 Corinthians	007	004	The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband.
1 Corinthians	007	005	Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season,
1 Corinthians	007	006	But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
1 Corinthians	007	007	Yet I wish that all men were like me.  However each man has his
1 Corinthians	007	008	But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them
1 Corinthians	007	009	But if they don't have self-control, let them marry.
1 Corinthians	007	010	But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife
1 Corinthians	007	011	(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled
1 Corinthians	007	012	But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has
1 Corinthians	007	013	The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content
1 Corinthians	007	014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife,
1 Corinthians	007	015	Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation.
1 Corinthians	007	016	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?
1 Corinthians	007	017	Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each,
1 Corinthians	007	018	Was anyone called having been circumcised?  Let him not
1 Corinthians	007	019	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
1 Corinthians	007	020	Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.
1 Corinthians	007	021	Were you called being a bondservant?  Don't let that bother you,
1 Corinthians	007	022	For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is
1 Corinthians	007	023	You were bought with a price.  Don't become bondservants of men.
1 Corinthians	007	024	Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called,
1 Corinthians	007	025	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord,
1 Corinthians	007	026	I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress
1 Corinthians	007	027	Are you bound to a wife?  Don't seek to be freed.
1 Corinthians	007	028	But if you marry, you have not sinned.  If a virgin marries,
1 Corinthians	007	029	But I say this, brothers:  the time is short, that from now on,
1 Corinthians	007	030	and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those
1 Corinthians	007	031	and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest.
1 Corinthians	007	032	But I desire to have you to be free from cares.
1 Corinthians	007	033	but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world,
1 Corinthians	007	034	There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin.
1 Corinthians	007	035	This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you,
1 Corinthians	007	036	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately
1 Corinthians	007	037	But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity,
1 Corinthians	007	038	So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well,
1 Corinthians	007	039	A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives;
1 Corinthians	007	040	But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment,
1 Corinthians	008	001	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols:  We know that we
1 Corinthians	008	002	But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet
1 Corinthians	008	003	But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.
1 Corinthians	008	004	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols,
1 Corinthians	008	005	For though there are things that are called "gods,"
1 Corinthians	008	006	yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things,
1 Corinthians	008	007	However, that knowledge isn't in all men.  But some,
1 Corinthians	008	008	But food will not commend us to God.  For neither, if we don't eat,
1 Corinthians	008	009	But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours
1 Corinthians	008	010	For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple,
1 Corinthians	008	011	And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother
1 Corinthians	008	012	Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience
1 Corinthians	008	013	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat
1 Corinthians	009	001	Am I not free?  Am I not an apostle?  Haven't I seen Jesus Christ,
1 Corinthians	009	002	If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you;
1 Corinthians	009	003	My defense to those who examine me is this.
1 Corinthians	009	004	Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians	009	005	Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer,
1 Corinthians	009	006	Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?
1 Corinthians	009	007	What soldier ever serves at his own expense?
1 Corinthians	009	008	Do I speak these things according to the ways of men?
1 Corinthians	009	009	For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle
1 Corinthians	009	010	or does he say it assuredly for our sake?  Yes, it was written
1 Corinthians	009	011	If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we
1 Corinthians	009	012	If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more?
1 Corinthians	009	013	Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat
1 Corinthians	009	014	Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News
1 Corinthians	009	015	But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things
1 Corinthians	009	016	For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about;
1 Corinthians	009	017	For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward.
1 Corinthians	009	018	What then is my reward?  That, when I preach the Good News, I may
1 Corinthians	009	019	For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage
1 Corinthians	009	020	To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews;
1 Corinthians	009	021	to those who are without law, as without law (not being
1 Corinthians	009	022	To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak.
1 Corinthians	009	023	Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be
1 Corinthians	009	024	Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one
1 Corinthians	009	025	Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control
1 Corinthians	009	026	I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly.  I fight like that,
1 Corinthians	009	027	but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means,
1 Corinthians	010	001	Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers
1 Corinthians	010	002	and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians	010	003	and all ate the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians	010	004	and all drank the same spiritual drink.  For they drank of a
1 Corinthians	010	005	However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they
1 Corinthians	010	006	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
1 Corinthians	010	007	Neither be idolaters, as some of them were.  As it is written,
1 Corinthians	010	008	Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed,
1 Corinthians	010	009	Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested,
1 Corinthians	010	010	Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished
1 Corinthians	010	011	Now all these things happened to them by way of example,
1 Corinthians	010	012	Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that
1 Corinthians	010	013	No temptation has taken you except what is common to man.
1 Corinthians	010	014	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians	010	015	I speak as to wise men.  Judge what I say.
1 Corinthians	010	016	The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a communion
1 Corinthians	010	017	Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body;
1 Corinthians	010	018	Consider Israel according to the flesh.  Don't those who eat
1 Corinthians	010	019	What am I saying then?  That a thing sacrificed to idols
1 Corinthians	010	020	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
1 Corinthians	010	021	You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
1 Corinthians	010	022	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  Are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians	010	023	"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are profitable.
1 Corinthians	010	024	Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.
1 Corinthians	010	025	Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question
1 Corinthians	010	026	for "the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."{Psalm 24:1}
1 Corinthians	010	027	But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal,
1 Corinthians	010	028	But if anyone says to you, "This was offered to idols,"
1 Corinthians	010	029	Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience.
1 Corinthians	010	030	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that
1 Corinthians	010	031	Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do,
1 Corinthians	010	032	Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks,
1 Corinthians	010	033	even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my
1 Corinthians	011	001	Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1 Corinthians	011	002	Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things,
1 Corinthians	011	003	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ,
1 Corinthians	011	004	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
1 Corinthians	011	005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled
1 Corinthians	011	006	For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn.
1 Corinthians	011	007	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered,
1 Corinthians	011	008	For man is not from woman, but woman from man;
1 Corinthians	011	009	for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.
1 Corinthians	011	010	For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head,
1 Corinthians	011	011	Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man,
1 Corinthians	011	012	For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman;
1 Corinthians	011	013	Judge for yourselves.  Is it appropriate that a woman pray
1 Corinthians	011	014	Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair,
1 Corinthians	011	015	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her
1 Corinthians	011	016	But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom,
1 Corinthians	011	017	But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you
1 Corinthians	011	018	For first of all, when you come together in the assembly,
1 Corinthians	011	019	For there also must be factions among you, that those who are
1 Corinthians	011	020	When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not
1 Corinthians	011	021	For in your eating each one takes his own supper first.
1 Corinthians	011	022	What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in?
1 Corinthians	011	023	For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered
1 Corinthians	011	024	When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat.
1 Corinthians	011	025	In the same way he also took the cup, after supper,
1 Corinthians	011	026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup,
1 Corinthians	011	027	Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup
1 Corinthians	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread,
1 Corinthians	011	029	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks
1 Corinthians	011	030	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not
1 Corinthians	011	031	For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.
1 Corinthians	011	032	But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we
1 Corinthians	011	033	Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat,
1 Corinthians	011	034	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming
1 Corinthians	012	001	Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you
1 Corinthians	012	002	You know that when you were heathen{or Gentiles}, you were led
1 Corinthians	012	003	Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by
1 Corinthians	012	004	Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1 Corinthians	012	005	There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.
1 Corinthians	012	006	There are various kinds of workings, but the same God,
1 Corinthians	012	007	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit
1 Corinthians	012	008	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom,
1 Corinthians	012	009	to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts
1 Corinthians	012	010	and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy;
1 Corinthians	012	011	But the one and the same Spirit works all of these,
1 Corinthians	012	012	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members
1 Corinthians	012	013	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
1 Corinthians	012	014	For the body is not one member, but many.
1 Corinthians	012	015	If the foot would say, "Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part
1 Corinthians	012	016	If the ear would say, "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part
1 Corinthians	012	017	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
1 Corinthians	012	018	But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body,
1 Corinthians	012	019	If they were all one member, where would the body be?
1 Corinthians	012	020	But now they are many members, but one body.
1 Corinthians	012	021	The eye can't tell the hand, "I have no need for you,"
1 Corinthians	012	022	No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be
1 Corinthians	012	023	Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable,
1 Corinthians	012	024	whereas our presentable parts have no such need.
1 Corinthians	012	025	that there should be no division in the body, but that the members
1 Corinthians	012	026	When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
1 Corinthians	012	027	Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
1 Corinthians	012	028	God has set some in the assembly:  first apostles,
1 Corinthians	012	029	Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers?
1 Corinthians	012	030	Do all have gifts of healings?  Do all speak with various languages?
1 Corinthians	012	031	But earnestly desire the best gifts.  Moreover, I show a most
1 Corinthians	013	001	If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't
1 Corinthians	013	002	If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and
1 Corinthians	013	003	If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my
1 Corinthians	013	004	Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy.
1 Corinthians	013	005	doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way,
1 Corinthians	013	006	doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
1 Corinthians	013	007	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
1 Corinthians	013	008	Love never fails.  But where there are prophecies, they will be done
1 Corinthians	013	009	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
1 Corinthians	013	010	but when that which is complete has come, then that which is
1 Corinthians	013	011	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child,
1 Corinthians	013	012	For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face.
1 Corinthians	013	013	But now faith, hope, and love remain--these three.
1 Corinthians	014	001	Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts,
1 Corinthians	014	002	For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God;
1 Corinthians	014	003	But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification,
1 Corinthians	014	004	He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who
1 Corinthians	014	005	Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages,
1 Corinthians	014	006	But now, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where context
1 Corinthians	014	007	Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp,
1 Corinthians	014	008	For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare
1 Corinthians	014	009	So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy
1 Corinthians	014	010	There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world,
1 Corinthians	014	011	If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would
1 Corinthians	014	012	So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts,
1 Corinthians	014	013	Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that
1 Corinthians	014	014	For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my
1 Corinthians	014	015	What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
1 Corinthians	014	016	Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills
1 Corinthians	014	017	For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person
1 Corinthians	014	018	I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.
1 Corinthians	014	019	However in the assembly I would rather speak five words
1 Corinthians	014	020	Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies,
1 Corinthians	014	021	In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages
1 Corinthians	014	022	Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe,
1 Corinthians	014	023	If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all
1 Corinthians	014	024	But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in,
1 Corinthians	014	025	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.  So he will
1 Corinthians	014	026	What is it then, brothers?  When you come together,
1 Corinthians	014	027	If any man speaks in another language, let it be two,
1 Corinthians	014	028	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly,
1 Corinthians	014	029	Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.
1 Corinthians	014	030	But if a revelation is made to another sitting by,
1 Corinthians	014	031	For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn,
1 Corinthians	014	032	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
1 Corinthians	014	033	for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.
1 Corinthians	014	034	let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been
1 Corinthians	014	035	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own
1 Corinthians	014	036	What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out?
1 Corinthians	014	037	If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual,
1 Corinthians	014	038	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1 Corinthians	014	039	Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't
1 Corinthians	014	040	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians	015	001	Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached
1 Corinthians	015	002	by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word
1 Corinthians	015	003	For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received:
1 Corinthians	015	004	that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day
1 Corinthians	015	005	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
1 Corinthians	015	006	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once,
1 Corinthians	015	007	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
1 Corinthians	015	008	and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time,
1 Corinthians	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be
1 Corinthians	015	010	But by the grace of God I am what I am.  His grace which was
1 Corinthians	015	011	Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
1 Corinthians	015	012	Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead,
1 Corinthians	015	013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has
1 Corinthians	015	014	If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain,
1 Corinthians	015	015	Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified
1 Corinthians	015	016	For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.
1 Corinthians	015	017	If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still
1 Corinthians	015	018	Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians	015	019	If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all
1 Corinthians	015	020	But now Christ has been raised from the dead.  He became
1 Corinthians	015	021	For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead
1 Corinthians	015	022	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
1 Corinthians	015	023	But each in his own order:  Christ the first fruits,
1 Corinthians	015	024	Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God,
1 Corinthians	015	025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians	015	026	The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians	015	027	For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet."{Psalm
1 Corinthians	015	028	When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will
1 Corinthians	015	029	Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead?
1 Corinthians	015	030	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians	015	031	I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus
1 Corinthians	015	032	If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes,
1 Corinthians	015	033	Don't be deceived!  "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
1 Corinthians	015	034	Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge
1 Corinthians	015	035	But someone will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what
1 Corinthians	015	036	You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive
1 Corinthians	015	037	That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be,
1 Corinthians	015	038	But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each
1 Corinthians	015	039	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men,
1 Corinthians	015	040	There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies;
1 Corinthians	015	041	There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon,
1 Corinthians	015	042	So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption;
1 Corinthians	015	043	It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.  It is sown
1 Corinthians	015	044	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians	015	045	So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living
1 Corinthians	015	046	However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which
1 Corinthians	015	047	The first man is of the earth, made of dust.  The second man
1 Corinthians	015	048	As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust;
1 Corinthians	015	049	As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's{NU, TR read
1 Corinthians	015	050	Now I say this, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where
1 Corinthians	015	051	Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We will not all sleep, but we
1 Corinthians	015	052	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
1 Corinthians	015	053	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal

1 Corinthians	016	001	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded
1 Corinthians	016	002	On the first day of the week, let each one of you save,
1 Corinthians	016	003	When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters
1 Corinthians	016	004	If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.
1 Corinthians	016	005	But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia,
1 Corinthians	016	006	But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter,
1 Corinthians	016	007	For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay
1 Corinthians	016	008	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
1 Corinthians	016	009	for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there
1 Corinthians	016	010	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear,
1 Corinthians	016	011	Therefore let no one despise him.  But set him forward on his
1 Corinthians	016	012	Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come
1 Corinthians	016	013	Watch!  Stand firm in the faith!  Be courageous!  Be strong!
1 Corinthians	016	014	Let all that you do be done in love.
1 Corinthians	016	015	Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas,
1 Corinthians	016	016	that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone
1 Corinthians	016	017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus;
1 Corinthians	016	018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours.  Therefore acknowledge
1 Corinthians	016	019	The assemblies of Asia greet you.  Aquila and Priscilla greet
1 Corinthians	016	020	All the brothers greet you.  Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians	016	021	This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
1 Corinthians	016	022	If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
1 Corinthians	016	023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians	016	024	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.  Amen.
2 Corinthians	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
2 Corinthians	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 Corinthians	001	004	who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able
2 Corinthians	001	005	For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our
2 Corinthians	001	006	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation.
2 Corinthians	001	007	Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are
2 Corinthians	001	008	For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,{The word
2 Corinthians	001	009	Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves,
2 Corinthians	001	010	who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver;
2 Corinthians	001	011	you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication;
2 Corinthians	001	012	For our boasting is this:  the testimony of our conscience,
2 Corinthians	001	013	For we write no other things to you, than what you read or
2 Corinthians	001	014	as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting,
2 Corinthians	001	015	In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you,
2 Corinthians	001	016	and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come
2 Corinthians	001	017	When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness?
2 Corinthians	001	018	But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and no."
2 Corinthians	001	019	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
2 Corinthians	001	020	For however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes."
2 Corinthians	001	021	Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed
2 Corinthians	001	022	who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit
2 Corinthians	001	023	But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come
2 Corinthians	001	024	Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow
2 Corinthians	002	001	But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you
2 Corinthians	002	002	For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who
2 Corinthians	002	003	And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came,
2 Corinthians	002	004	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you
2 Corinthians	002	005	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me,
2 Corinthians	002	006	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted
2 Corinthians	002	007	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and
2 Corinthians	002	008	Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.
2 Corinthians	002	009	For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you,
2 Corinthians	002	010	Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything.
2 Corinthians	002	011	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are
2 Corinthians	002	012	Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ,
2 Corinthians	002	013	I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus,
2 Corinthians	002	014	Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ,
2 Corinthians	002	015	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved,
2 Corinthians	002	016	to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet
2 Corinthians	002	017	For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God.
2 Corinthians	003	001	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need,
2 Corinthians	003	002	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read
2 Corinthians	003	003	being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us,
2 Corinthians	003	004	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;
2 Corinthians	003	005	not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything
2 Corinthians	003	006	who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant;
2 Corinthians	003	007	But if the service of death, written engraved on stones,
2 Corinthians	003	008	won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?
2 Corinthians	003	009	For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service
2 Corinthians	003	010	For most certainly that which has been made glorious has
2 Corinthians	003	011	For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that
2 Corinthians	003	012	Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
2 Corinthians	003	013	and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children
2 Corinthians	003	014	But their minds were hardened, for until this very day
2 Corinthians	003	015	But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.
2 Corinthians	003	016	But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
2 Corinthians	003	017	Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
2 Corinthians	003	018	But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory
2 Corinthians	004	001	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy,
2 Corinthians	004	002	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking
2 Corinthians	004	003	Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;
2 Corinthians	004	004	in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of
2 Corinthians	004	005	For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord,
2 Corinthians	004	006	seeing it is God who said, "Light will shine out of
2 Corinthians	004	007	But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding
2 Corinthians	004	008	We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet
2 Corinthians	004	009	pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;
2 Corinthians	004	010	always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus,
2 Corinthians	004	011	For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus'
2 Corinthians	004	012	So then death works in us, but life in you.
2 Corinthians	004	013	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which
2 Corinthians	004	014	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us
2 Corinthians	004	015	For all things are for your sakes, that the grace,
2 Corinthians	004	016	Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying,
2 Corinthians	004	017	For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us
2 Corinthians	004	018	while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things
2 Corinthians	005	001	For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved,
2 Corinthians	005	002	For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed
2 Corinthians	005	003	if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.
2 Corinthians	005	004	For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened;
2 Corinthians	005	005	Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave
2 Corinthians	005	006	Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we
2 Corinthians	005	007	for we walk by faith, not by sight.
2 Corinthians	005	008	We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be
2 Corinthians	005	009	Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent,
2 Corinthians	005	010	For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ;
2 Corinthians	005	011	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men,
2 Corinthians	005	012	For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak
2 Corinthians	005	013	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God.  Or if we are
2 Corinthians	005	014	For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus,
2 Corinthians	005	015	He died for all, that those who live should no longer
2 Corinthians	005	016	Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on.
2 Corinthians	005	017	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
2 Corinthians	005	018	But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through
2 Corinthians	005	019	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,
2 Corinthians	005	020	We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though
2 Corinthians	005	021	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf;
2 Corinthians	006	001	Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace
2 Corinthians	006	002	for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you,
2 Corinthians	006	003	We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service
2 Corinthians	006	004	but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God,
2 Corinthians	006	005	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors,
2 Corinthians	006	006	in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness,
2 Corinthians	006	007	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor
2 Corinthians	006	008	by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report;
2 Corinthians	006	009	as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live;
2 Corinthians	006	010	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
2 Corinthians	006	011	Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians.  Our heart is enlarged.
2 Corinthians	006	012	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by
2 Corinthians	006	013	Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.
2 Corinthians	006	014	Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship
2 Corinthians	006	015	What agreement has Christ with Belial?  Or what portion has
2 Corinthians	006	016	What agreement has a temple of God with idols?
2 Corinthians	006	017	Therefore, "'Come out from among them, and be separate,'
2 Corinthians	006	018	I will be to you a Father.  You will be to me sons and daughters,'
2 Corinthians	007	001	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
2 Corinthians	007	002	Open your hearts to us.  We wronged no one.  We corrupted no one.
2 Corinthians	007	003	I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before,
2 Corinthians	007	004	Great is my boldness of speech toward you.  Great is my
2 Corinthians	007	005	For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief,
2 Corinthians	007	006	Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us
2 Corinthians	007	007	and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which
2 Corinthians	007	008	For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it,
2 Corinthians	007	009	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made
2 Corinthians	007	010	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings
2 Corinthians	007	011	For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry
2 Corinthians	007	012	So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that
2 Corinthians	007	013	Therefore we have been comforted.  In our comfort we rejoiced
2 Corinthians	007	014	For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf,
2 Corinthians	007	015	His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers
2 Corinthians	007	016	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
2 Corinthians	008	001	Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God
2 Corinthians	008	002	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy
2 Corinthians	008	003	For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power,
2 Corinthians	008	004	begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and
2 Corinthians	008	005	This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own
2 Corinthians	008	006	So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before,
2 Corinthians	008	007	But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge,
2 Corinthians	008	008	I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through
2 Corinthians	008	009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,
2 Corinthians	008	010	I give a judgment in this:  for this is expedient for you,
2 Corinthians	008	011	But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness
2 Corinthians	008	012	For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according
2 Corinthians	008	013	For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
2 Corinthians	008	014	but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies
2 Corinthians	008	015	As it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over,
2 Corinthians	008	016	But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you
2 Corinthians	008	017	For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself
2 Corinthians	008	018	We have sent together with him the brother whose praise
2 Corinthians	008	019	Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies
2 Corinthians	008	020	We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning
2 Corinthians	008	021	Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight
2 Corinthians	008	022	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times
2 Corinthians	008	023	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you.
2 Corinthians	008	024	Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front
2 Corinthians	009	001	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning
2 Corinthians	009	002	for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them
2 Corinthians	009	003	But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf
2 Corinthians	009	004	so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of
2 Corinthians	009	005	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they
2 Corinthians	009	006	Remember this:  he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly.
2 Corinthians	009	007	Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart;
2 Corinthians	009	008	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you,
2 Corinthians	009	009	As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor.
2 Corinthians	009	010	Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food,
2 Corinthians	009	011	you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works
2 Corinthians	009	012	For this service of giving that you perform not only makes
2 Corinthians	009	013	seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify
2 Corinthians	009	014	while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf,
2 Corinthians	009	015	Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!
2 Corinthians	010	001	Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness
2 Corinthians	010	002	Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with
2 Corinthians	010	003	For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according
2 Corinthians	010	004	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty
2 Corinthians	010	005	throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted
2 Corinthians	010	006	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your
2 Corinthians	010	007	Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face?
2 Corinthians	010	008	For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning
2 Corinthians	010	009	that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.
2 Corinthians	010	010	For, "His letters," they say, "are weighty and strong,
2 Corinthians	010	011	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word
2 Corinthians	010	012	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some
2 Corinthians	010	013	But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within
2 Corinthians	010	014	For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't
2 Corinthians	010	015	not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors,
2 Corinthians	010	016	so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you,
2 Corinthians	010	017	But "he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."{Jeremiah 9:24}
2 Corinthians	010	018	For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved,
2 Corinthians	011	001	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness,
2 Corinthians	011	002	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy.
2 Corinthians	011	003	But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve
2 Corinthians	011	004	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach,
2 Corinthians	011	005	For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.
2 Corinthians	011	006	But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled
2 Corinthians	011	007	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted,
2 Corinthians	011	008	I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I
2 Corinthians	011	009	When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden
2 Corinthians	011	010	As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this
2 Corinthians	011	011	Why?  Because I don't love you?  God knows.
2 Corinthians	011	012	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
2 Corinthians	011	013	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers,
2 Corinthians	011	014	And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
2 Corinthians	011	015	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade
2 Corinthians	011	016	I say again, let no one think me foolish.  But if so,
2 Corinthians	011	017	That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord,
2 Corinthians	011	018	Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.
2 Corinthians	011	019	For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.
2 Corinthians	011	020	For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage,
2 Corinthians	011	021	I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak.
2 Corinthians	011	022	Are they Hebrews?  So am I. Are they Israelites?  So am I. Are
2 Corinthians	011	023	Are they servants of Christ?  (I speak as one beside himself)
2 Corinthians	011	024	Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.
2 Corinthians	011	025	Three times I was beaten with rods.  Once I was stoned.
2 Corinthians	011	026	I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers,
2 Corinthians	011	027	in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,
2 Corinthians	011	028	Besides those things that are outside, there is that which
2 Corinthians	011	029	Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is caused to stumble,
2 Corinthians	011	030	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.
2 Corinthians	011	031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is
2 Corinthians	011	032	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city
2 Corinthians	011	033	Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall,
2 Corinthians	012	001	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast.
2 Corinthians	012	002	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body,
2 Corinthians	012	003	I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body,
2 Corinthians	012	004	how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words,
2 Corinthians	012	005	On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I
2 Corinthians	012	006	For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish;
2 Corinthians	012	007	By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations,
2 Corinthians	012	008	Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it
2 Corinthians	012	009	He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my
2 Corinthians	012	010	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries,
2 Corinthians	012	011	I have become foolish in boasting.  You compelled me, for I
2 Corinthians	012	012	Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience,
2 Corinthians	012	013	For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of
2 Corinthians	012	014	Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I
2 Corinthians	012	015	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls.
2 Corinthians	012	016	But be it so, I did not myself burden you.  But, being crafty,
2 Corinthians	012	017	Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have
2 Corinthians	012	018	I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.  Did Titus
2 Corinthians	012	019	Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you?
2 Corinthians	012	020	For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find
2 Corinthians	012	021	that again when I come my God would humble me before you,
2 Corinthians	013	001	This is the third time I am coming to you.  "At the mouth of two
2 Corinthians	013	002	I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I
2 Corinthians	013	003	seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me;
2 Corinthians	013	004	For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through
2 Corinthians	013	005	Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith.
2 Corinthians	013	006	But I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.
2 Corinthians	013	007	Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may
2 Corinthians	013	008	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2 Corinthians	013	009	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong.
2 Corinthians	013	010	For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not
2 Corinthians	013	011	Finally, brothers, rejoice.  Be perfected, be comforted,
2 Corinthians	013	012	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians	013	013	All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians	013	014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God,
Galatians	001	001	Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man,
Galatians	001	002	and all the brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where context
Galatians	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our
Galatians	001	004	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us
Galatians	001	005	to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.
Galatians	001	006	I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you
Galatians	001	007	and there isn't another "good news."  Only there are some who
Galatians	001	008	But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
Galatians	001	009	As we have said before, so I now say again:  if any man preaches
Galatians	001	010	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God?  Or am I
Galatians	001	011	But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News
Galatians	001	012	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it,
Galatians	001	013	For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews'
Galatians	001	014	I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among
Galatians	001	015	But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me
Galatians	001	016	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among
Galatians	001	017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me,
Galatians	001	018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter,
Galatians	001	019	But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James,
Galatians	001	020	Now about the things which I write to you, behold,
Galatians	001	021	Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians	001	022	I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which
Galatians	001	023	but they only heard:  "He who once persecuted us now preaches
Galatians	001	024	And they glorified God in me.
Galatians	002	001	Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem
Galatians	002	002	I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News
Galatians	002	003	But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
Galatians	002	004	This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in,
Galatians	002	005	to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour,
Galatians	002	006	But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were,
Galatians	002	007	but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted
Galatians	002	008	(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision
Galatians	002	009	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me,
Galatians	002	010	They only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I
Galatians	002	011	But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face,
Galatians	002	012	For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles.
Galatians	002	013	And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy;
Galatians	002	014	But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth
Galatians	002	015	"We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,
Galatians	002	016	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law
Galatians	002	017	But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
Galatians	002	018	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed,
Galatians	002	019	For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.
Galatians	002	020	I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I
Galatians	002	021	I don't make void the grace of God.  For if righteousness
Galatians	003	001	Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth,
Galatians	003	002	I just want to learn this from you.  Did you receive the Spirit
Galatians	003	003	Are you so foolish?  Having begun in the Spirit, are you now
Galatians	003	004	Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
Galatians	003	005	He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works
Galatians	003	006	Even as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to
Galatians	003	007	Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are
Galatians	003	008	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles
Galatians	003	009	So then, those who are of faith are blessed with
Galatians	003	010	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse.
Galatians	003	011	Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident,
Galatians	003	012	The law is not of faith, but, "The man who does them will live
Galatians	003	013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become
Galatians	003	014	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
Galatians	003	015	Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant,
Galatians	003	016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.
Galatians	003	017	Now I say this.  A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ,
Galatians	003	018	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise;
Galatians	003	019	What then is the law?  It was added because of transgressions,
Galatians	003	020	Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.
Galatians	003	021	Is the law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not!
Galatians	003	022	But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin,
Galatians	003	023	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law,
Galatians	003	024	So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ,
Galatians	003	025	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Galatians	003	026	For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians	003	027	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians	003	028	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
Galatians	003	029	If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs
Galatians	004	001	But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different
Galatians	004	002	but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed
Galatians	004	003	So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under
Galatians	004	004	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son,
Galatians	004	005	that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we
Galatians	004	006	And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit
Galatians	004	007	So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son,
Galatians	004	008	However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage
Galatians	004	009	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known
Galatians	004	010	You observe days, months, seasons, and years.
Galatians	004	011	I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.
Galatians	004	012	I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become
Galatians	004	013	but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached
Galatians	004	014	That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't
Galatians	004	015	What was the blessing you enjoyed?  For I testify to you that,
Galatians	004	016	So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians	004	017	They zealously seek you in no good way.  No, they desire
Galatians	004	018	But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not
Galatians	004	019	My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ
Galatians	004	020	but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change
Galatians	004	021	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen
Galatians	004	022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid,
Galatians	004	023	However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh,
Galatians	004	024	These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants.
Galatians	004	025	For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers
Galatians	004	026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother
Galatians	004	027	For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear.
Galatians	004	028	Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
Galatians	004	029	But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted
Galatians	004	030	However what does the Scripture say?  "Throw out the handmaid
Galatians	004	031	So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid,
Galatians	005	001	Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made
Galatians	005	002	Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision,
Galatians	005	003	Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision,
Galatians	005	004	You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified
Galatians	005	005	For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the
Galatians	005	006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything,
Galatians	005	007	You were running well!  Who interfered with you that you
Galatians	005	008	This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
Galatians	005	009	A little yeast grows through the whole lump.
Galatians	005	010	I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think
Galatians	005	011	But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I
Galatians	005	012	I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
Galatians	005	013	For you, brothers, were called for freedom.  Only don't use
Galatians	005	014	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this:
Galatians	005	015	But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you
Galatians	005	016	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust
Galatians	005	017	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit
Galatians	005	018	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
Galatians	005	019	Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are:
Galatians	005	020	idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger,
Galatians	005	021	envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these;
Galatians	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
Galatians	005	023	gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there
Galatians	005	024	Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its
Galatians	005	025	If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.
Galatians	005	026	Let's not become conceited, provoking one another,
Galatians	006	001	Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are
Galatians	006	002	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians	006	003	For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing,
Galatians	006	004	But let each man test his own work, and then he will take
Galatians	006	005	For each man will bear his own burden.
Galatians	006	006	But let him who is taught in the word share all good things
Galatians	006	007	Don't be deceived.  God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows,
Galatians	006	008	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption.
Galatians	006	009	Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season,
Galatians	006	010	So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward
Galatians	006	011	See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
Galatians	006	012	As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you
Galatians	006	013	For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves,
Galatians	006	014	But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our
Galatians	006	015	For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything,
Galatians	006	016	As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them,
Galatians	006	017	From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear
Galatians	006	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
Ephesians	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
Ephesians	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Ephesians	001	004	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
Ephesians	001	005	having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ
Ephesians	001	006	to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely
Ephesians	001	007	in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
Ephesians	001	008	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
Ephesians	001	009	making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his
Ephesians	001	010	to an administration of the fullness of the times,
Ephesians	001	011	in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been
Ephesians	001	012	to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory,
Ephesians	001	013	in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth,
Ephesians	001	014	who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's
Ephesians	001	015	For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus
Ephesians	001	016	don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you
Ephesians	001	017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
Ephesians	001	018	having the eyes of your hearts{TR reads "understanding"
Ephesians	001	019	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us
Ephesians	001	020	which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
Ephesians	001	021	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion,
Ephesians	001	022	He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him
Ephesians	001	023	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
Ephesians	002	001	You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,
Ephesians	002	002	in which you once walked according to the course of this world,
Ephesians	002	003	among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh,
Ephesians	002	004	But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which
Ephesians	002	005	even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive
Ephesians	002	006	and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him
Ephesians	002	007	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches
Ephesians	002	008	for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not
Ephesians	002	009	not of works, that no one would boast.
Ephesians	002	010	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
Ephesians	002	011	Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are
Ephesians	002	012	that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from
Ephesians	002	013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made
Ephesians	002	014	For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle
Ephesians	002	015	having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of
Ephesians	002	016	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross,
Ephesians	002	017	He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to
Ephesians	002	018	For through him we both have our access in one Spirit
Ephesians	002	019	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are
Ephesians	002	020	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Ephesians	002	021	in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy
Ephesians	002	022	in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God
Ephesians	003	001	For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on
Ephesians	003	002	if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that
Ephesians	003	003	how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me,
Ephesians	003	004	by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding
Ephesians	003	005	which in other generations was not made known to the children
Ephesians	003	006	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body,
Ephesians	003	007	of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that

Ephesians	003	014	For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our
Ephesians	003	015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians	003	016	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
Ephesians	003	017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end
Ephesians	003	018	may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is
Ephesians	003	019	and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you
Ephesians	003	020	Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all
Ephesians	003	021	to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all
Ephesians	004	001	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily
Ephesians	004	002	with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with
Ephesians	004	003	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians	004	004	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called
Ephesians	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians	004	006	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all,
Ephesians	004	007	But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure
Ephesians	004	008	Therefore he says, "When he ascended on high, he led
Ephesians	004	009	Now this, "He ascended," what is it but that he also first
Ephesians	004	010	He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all

Ephesians	004	013	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of
Ephesians	004	014	that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried
Ephesians	004	015	but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him,
Ephesians	004	016	from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through
Ephesians	004	017	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you
Ephesians	004	018	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from
Ephesians	004	019	who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work
Ephesians	004	020	But you did not learn Christ that way;
Ephesians	004	021	if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth
Ephesians	004	022	that you put away, as concerning your former way of life,
Ephesians	004	023	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
Ephesians	004	024	and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been

Ephesians	005	006	Let no one deceive you with empty words.  For because of these things,
Ephesians	005	007	Therefore don't be partakers with them.
Ephesians	005	008	For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord.
Ephesians	005	009	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and

Ephesians	005	011	Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
Ephesians	005	012	For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame
Ephesians	005	013	But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light,

Ephesians	005	022	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
Ephesians	005	023	For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is
Ephesians	005	024	But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives
Ephesians	005	025	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly,
Ephesians	005	026	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing
Ephesians	005	027	that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously,
Ephesians	005	028	Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their
Ephesians	005	029	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it,

Philippians	002	007	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made
Philippians	002	008	And being found in human form, he humbled himself,
Philippians	002	009	Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name
Philippians	002	010	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven,
Philippians	002	011	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
Philippians	002	012	So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed,
Philippians	002	013	For it is God who works in you both to will and to work,
Philippians	002	014	Do all things without murmurings and disputes,
Philippians	002	015	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without
Philippians	002	016	holding up the word of life; that I may have something
Philippians	002	017	Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service
Philippians	002	018	In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
Philippians	002	019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon,
Philippians	002	020	For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
Philippians	002	021	For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
Philippians	002	022	But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father,
Philippians	002	023	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it
Philippians	002	024	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
Philippians	002	025	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,
Philippians	002	026	since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you
Philippians	002	027	For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him;
Philippians	002	028	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see
Philippians	002	029	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold
Philippians	002	030	because for the work of Christ he came near to death,
Philippians	003	001	Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the same
Philippians	003	002	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of
Philippians	003	003	For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit,
Philippians	003	004	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh.
Philippians	003	005	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe
Philippians	003	006	concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the
Philippians	003	007	However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted
Philippians	003	008	Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for
Philippians	003	009	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own,
Philippians	003	010	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,
Philippians	003	011	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians	003	012	Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect;
Philippians	003	013	Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold,
Philippians	003	014	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling
Philippians	003	015	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way.
Philippians	003	016	Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained,
Philippians	003	017	Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk
Philippians	003	018	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you
Philippians	003	019	whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose
Philippians	003	020	For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait
Philippians	003	021	who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed
Philippians	004	001	Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,
Philippians	004	002	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way
Philippians	004	003	Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women,
Philippians	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again I will say, Rejoice!
Philippians	004	005	Let your gentleness be known to all men.  The Lord is at hand.
Philippians	004	006	In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition
Philippians	004	007	And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
Philippians	004	008	Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things
Philippians	004	009	The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me:
Philippians	004	010	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you
Philippians	004	011	Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned
Philippians	004	012	I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound.
Philippians	004	013	I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
Philippians	004	014	However you did well that you shared in my affliction.
Philippians	004	015	You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning
Philippians	004	016	For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
Philippians	004	017	Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that
Philippians	004	018	But I have all things, and abound.  I am filled, having
Philippians	004	019	My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches
Philippians	004	020	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!  Amen.
Philippians	004	021	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.  The brothers who are
Philippians	004	022	All the saints greet you, especially those who are
Philippians	004	023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.

Colossians	001	006	which has come to you; even as it is in all the world
Colossians	001	007	even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant,

1 Thessalonians	001	001	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
1 Thessalonians	001	002	We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you
1 Thessalonians	001	003	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor
1 Thessalonians	001	004	We know, brothers{The word for "brothers" here and where context
1 Thessalonians	001	005	and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also
1 Thessalonians	001	006	You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received
1 Thessalonians	001	007	so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia
1 Thessalonians	001	008	For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only
1 Thessalonians	001	009	For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception
1 Thessalonians	001	010	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from
1 Thessalonians	002	001	For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,
1 Thessalonians	002	002	but having suffered before and been shamefully treated,
1 Thessalonians	002	003	For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness,
1 Thessalonians	002	004	But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
1 Thessalonians	002	005	For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery,
1 Thessalonians	002	006	nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others),
1 Thessalonians	002	007	But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes
1 Thessalonians	002	008	Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased
1 Thessalonians	002	009	For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail;
1 Thessalonians	002	010	You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly
1 Thessalonians	002	011	As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you,
1 Thessalonians	002	012	to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls
1 Thessalonians	002	013	For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that,
1 Thessalonians	002	014	For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God
1 Thessalonians	002	015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,
1 Thessalonians	002	016	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved;
1 Thessalonians	002	017	But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season,
1 Thessalonians	002	018	because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again--
1 Thessalonians	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
1 Thessalonians	002	020	For you are our glory and our joy.
1 Thessalonians	003	001	Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought
1 Thessalonians	003	002	and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the
1 Thessalonians	003	003	that no one be moved by these afflictions.  For you know
1 Thessalonians	003	004	For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand
1 Thessalonians	003	005	For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer,
1 Thessalonians	003	006	But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought
1 Thessalonians	003	007	for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all
1 Thessalonians	003	008	For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians	003	009	For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you,
1 Thessalonians	003	010	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face,
1 Thessalonians	003	011	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians	003	012	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
1 Thessalonians	003	013	to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness
1 Thessalonians	004	001	Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus,
1 Thessalonians	004	002	For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians	004	003	For this is the will of God:  your sanctification, that you
1 Thessalonians	004	004	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own
1 Thessalonians	004	005	not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;
1 Thessalonians	004	006	that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother
1 Thessalonians	004	007	For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
1 Thessalonians	004	008	Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God,
1 Thessalonians	004	009	But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write
1 Thessalonians	004	010	for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in
1 Thessalonians	004	011	and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life,
1 Thessalonians	004	012	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside,
1 Thessalonians	004	013	But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those
1 Thessalonians	004	014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God
1 Thessalonians	004	015	For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive,
1 Thessalonians	004	016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
1 Thessalonians	004	017	then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together
1 Thessalonians	004	018	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians	005	001	But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have
1 Thessalonians	005	002	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes
1 Thessalonians	005	003	For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction
1 Thessalonians	005	004	But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should
1 Thessalonians	005	005	You are all children of light, and children of the day.
1 Thessalonians	005	006	so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch
1 Thessalonians	005	007	For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk
1 Thessalonians	005	008	But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on
1 Thessalonians	005	009	For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining
1 Thessalonians	005	010	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
1 Thessalonians	005	011	Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up,
1 Thessalonians	005	012	But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you,
1 Thessalonians	005	013	and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.
1 Thessalonians	005	014	We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage
1 Thessalonians	005	015	See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always
1 Thessalonians	005	016	Rejoice always.
1 Thessalonians	005	017	Pray without ceasing.
1 Thessalonians	005	018	In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God
1 Thessalonians	005	019	Don't quench the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians	005	020	Don't despise prophesies.
1 Thessalonians	005	021	Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
1 Thessalonians	005	022	Abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians	005	023	May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.
1 Thessalonians	005	024	He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
1 Thessalonians	005	025	Brothers, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians	005	026	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians	005	027	I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read
1 Thessalonians	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.
2 Thessalonians	001	001	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
2 Thessalonians	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians	001	003	We are bound to always give thanks to God for you,
2 Thessalonians	001	004	so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God
2 Thessalonians	001	005	This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God,
2 Thessalonians	001	006	Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction
2 Thessalonians	001	007	and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us,
2 Thessalonians	001	008	giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those
2 Thessalonians	001	009	who will pay the penalty:  eternal destruction from the face
2 Thessalonians	001	010	when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired
2 Thessalonians	001	011	To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may
2 Thessalonians	001	012	that the name of our Lord Jesus{TR adds "Christ"} may be
2 Thessalonians	002	001	Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 Thessalonians	002	002	not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled,
2 Thessalonians	002	003	Let no one deceive you in any way.  For it will not be,
2 Thessalonians	002	004	he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called
2 Thessalonians	002	005	Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told
2 Thessalonians	002	006	Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may
2 Thessalonians	002	007	For the mystery of lawlessness already works.  Only there
2 Thessalonians	002	008	Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill
2 Thessalonians	002	009	even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan
2 Thessalonians	002	010	and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost,
2 Thessalonians	002	011	Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they
2 Thessalonians	002	012	that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth,
2 Thessalonians	002	013	But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you,
2 Thessalonians	002	014	to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining
2 Thessalonians	002	015	So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you
2 Thessalonians	002	016	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved
2 Thessalonians	002	017	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians	003	001	Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord
2 Thessalonians	003	002	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men;
2 Thessalonians	003	003	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard
2 Thessalonians	003	004	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both
2 Thessalonians	003	005	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God,
2 Thessalonians	003	006	Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
2 Thessalonians	003	007	For you know how you ought to imitate us.  For we didn't behave
2 Thessalonians	003	008	neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying
2 Thessalonians	003	009	not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves
2 Thessalonians	003	010	For even when we were with you, we commanded you this:
2 Thessalonians	003	011	For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't
2 Thessalonians	003	012	Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the
2 Thessalonians	003	013	But you, brothers, don't be weary in doing well.
2 Thessalonians	003	014	If any man doesn't obey our word in this letter, note that man,
2 Thessalonians	003	015	Don't count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians	003	016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times
2 Thessalonians	003	017	The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign
2 Thessalonians	003	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.
1 Timothy	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment
1 Timothy	001	002	to Timothy, my true child in faith:  Grace, mercy, and peace,
1 Timothy	001	003	As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at
1 Timothy	001	004	neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies,
1 Timothy	001	005	but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure heart and a
1 Timothy	001	006	from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned
1 Timothy	001	007	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand
1 Timothy	001	008	But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,
1 Timothy	001	009	as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man,
1 Timothy	001	010	for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders,
1 Timothy	001	011	according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God,
1 Timothy	001	012	And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord,
1 Timothy	001	013	although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent.
1 Timothy	001	014	The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love
1 Timothy	001	015	The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance,
1 Timothy	001	016	However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first,
1 Timothy	001	017	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone
1 Timothy	001	018	This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to
1 Timothy	001	019	holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust
1 Timothy	001	020	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan,
1 Timothy	002	001	I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
1 Timothy	002	002	for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead
1 Timothy	002	003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
1 Timothy	002	004	who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge
1 Timothy	002	005	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
1 Timothy	002	006	who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in
1 Timothy	002	007	to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling
1 Timothy	002	008	I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up
1 Timothy	002	009	In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing,
1 Timothy	002	010	but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.
1 Timothy	002	011	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
1 Timothy	002	012	But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority
1 Timothy	002	013	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
1 Timothy	002	014	Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived,
1 Timothy	002	015	but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue
1 Timothy	003	001	This is a faithful saying:  if a man seeks the office
1 Timothy	003	002	The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband
1 Timothy	003	003	not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle,
1 Timothy	003	004	one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection
1 Timothy	003	005	(but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house,
1 Timothy	003	006	not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same
1 Timothy	003	007	Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside,
1 Timothy	003	008	Servants{or, Deacons.}, in the same way, must be reverent,
1 Timothy	003	009	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy	003	010	Let them also first be tested; then let them serve{or,
1 Timothy	003	011	Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers,
1 Timothy	003	012	Let servants{or, deacons} be husbands of one wife, ruling their
1 Timothy	003	013	For those who have served well{or, served well as deacons}
1 Timothy	003	014	These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
1 Timothy	003	015	but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave
1 Timothy	003	016	Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:
1 Timothy	004	001	But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall
1 Timothy	004	002	through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their
1 Timothy	004	003	forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God
1 Timothy	004	004	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected,
1 Timothy	004	005	For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy	004	006	If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good
1 Timothy	004	007	But refuse profane and old wives' fables.  Exercise yourself
1 Timothy	004	008	For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value
1 Timothy	004	009	This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
1 Timothy	004	010	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have
1 Timothy	004	011	Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy	004	012	Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those
1 Timothy	004	013	Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation,
1 Timothy	004	014	Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you
1 Timothy	004	015	Be diligent in these things.  Give yourself wholly to them,
1 Timothy	004	016	Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching.
1 Timothy	005	001	Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father;
1 Timothy	005	002	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters,
1 Timothy	005	003	Honor widows who are widows indeed.
1 Timothy	005	004	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn
1 Timothy	005	005	Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set
1 Timothy	005	006	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
1 Timothy	005	007	Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.
1 Timothy	005	008	But if anyone doesn't provide for his own, and especially
1 Timothy	005	009	Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old,
1 Timothy	005	010	being approved by good works, if she has brought up children,
1 Timothy	005	011	But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton
1 Timothy	005	012	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
1 Timothy	005	013	Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house.
1 Timothy	005	014	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry,
1 Timothy	005	015	For already some have turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy	005	016	If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them,
1 Timothy	005	017	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
1 Timothy	005	018	For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox when it
1 Timothy	005	019	Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word
1 Timothy	005	020	Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest
1 Timothy	005	021	I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the
1 Timothy	005	022	Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other
1 Timothy	005	023	Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine
1 Timothy	005	024	Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment,
1 Timothy	005	025	In the same way also there are good works that are obvious,
1 Timothy	006	001	Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their
1 Timothy	006	002	Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them,
1 Timothy	006	003	If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent
1 Timothy	006	004	he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments,
1 Timothy	006	005	constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute
1 Timothy	006	006	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy	006	007	For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can't
1 Timothy	006	008	But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.
1 Timothy	006	009	But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation
1 Timothy	006	010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
1 Timothy	006	011	But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after
1 Timothy	006	012	Fight the good fight of faith.  Lay hold of the eternal life
1 Timothy	006	013	I charge you before God, who gives life to all things,
1 Timothy	006	014	that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the
1 Timothy	006	015	which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed
1 Timothy	006	016	who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light;
1 Timothy	006	017	Charge those who are rich in this present world that they
1 Timothy	006	018	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they
1 Timothy	006	019	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
1 Timothy	006	020	Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away
1 Timothy	006	021	which some professing have erred concerning the faith.
2 Timothy	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,
2 Timothy	001	002	to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace,
2 Timothy	001	003	I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a
2 Timothy	001	004	longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be
2 Timothy	001	005	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you;
2 Timothy	001	006	For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift
2 Timothy	001	007	For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power,
2 Timothy	001	008	Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
2 Timothy	001	009	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according
2 Timothy	001	010	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our
2 Timothy	001	011	For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle,
2 Timothy	001	012	For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed,
2 Timothy	001	013	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,
2 Timothy	001	014	That good thing which was committed to you, guard through
2 Timothy	001	015	This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me;
2 Timothy	001	016	May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus,
2 Timothy	001	017	but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
2 Timothy	001	018	(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day);
2 Timothy	002	001	You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is
2 Timothy	002	002	The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses,
2 Timothy	002	003	You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier
2 Timothy	002	004	No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life,
2 Timothy	002	005	Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless
2 Timothy	002	006	The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share
2 Timothy	002	007	Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding
2 Timothy	002	008	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David,
2 Timothy	002	009	in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal.
2 Timothy	002	010	Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they
2 Timothy	002	011	This saying is faithful:  "For if we died with him, we will
2 Timothy	002	012	If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him,
2 Timothy	002	013	If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself."
2 Timothy	002	014	Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight
2 Timothy	002	015	Give diligence to present yourself approved by God,
2 Timothy	002	016	But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
2 Timothy	002	017	and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is
2 Timothy	002	018	men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection
2 Timothy	002	019	However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal,
2 Timothy	002	020	Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and
2 Timothy	002	021	If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel
2 Timothy	002	022	Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love,
2 Timothy	002	023	But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that
2 Timothy	002	024	The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all,
2 Timothy	002	025	in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may
2 Timothy	002	026	and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare,
2 Timothy	003	001	But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.
2 Timothy	003	002	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
2 Timothy	003	003	without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers,
2 Timothy	003	004	traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
2 Timothy	003	005	holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof.
2 Timothy	003	006	For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive
2 Timothy	003	007	always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge
2 Timothy	003	008	Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose
2 Timothy	003	009	But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be
2 Timothy	003	010	But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith,
2 Timothy	003	011	persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me
2 Timothy	003	012	Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus
2 Timothy	003	013	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse,
2 Timothy	003	014	But you remain in the things which you have learned and have
2 Timothy	003	015	From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are
2 Timothy	003	016	Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is
2 Timothy	003	017	that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
2 Timothy	004	001	I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
2 Timothy	004	002	preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season;
2 Timothy	004	003	For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound
2 Timothy	004	004	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn
2 Timothy	004	005	But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work
2 Timothy	004	006	For I am already being offered, and the time of my
2 Timothy	004	007	I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course.
2 Timothy	004	008	From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness,
2 Timothy	004	009	Be diligent to come to me soon,
2 Timothy	004	010	for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went
2 Timothy	004	011	Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you,
2 Timothy	004	012	But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy	004	013	Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come,
2 Timothy	004	014	Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me.
2 Timothy	004	015	of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
2 Timothy	004	016	At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me.
2 Timothy	004	017	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me
2 Timothy	004	018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will
2 Timothy	004	019	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy	004	020	Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
2 Timothy	004	021	Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you,
2 Timothy	004	022	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be
Titus	001	001	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
Titus	001	002	in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie,
Titus	001	003	but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I
Titus	001	004	to Titus, my true child according to a common faith:
Titus	001	005	I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order
Titus	001	006	if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children
Titus	001	007	For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward;
Titus	001	008	but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded,
Titus	001	009	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching,
Titus	001	010	For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers,
Titus	001	011	whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses,
Titus	001	012	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars,
Titus	001	013	This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply,
Titus	001	014	not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men
Titus	001	015	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled
Titus	001	016	They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him,
Titus	002	001	But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
Titus	002	002	that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded,
Titus	002	003	and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior,
Titus	002	004	that they may train the young women to love their husbands,
Titus	002	005	to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in
Titus	002	006	Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
Titus	002	007	in all things showing yourself an example of good works;
Titus	002	008	and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes
Titus	002	009	Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters,
Titus	002	010	not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
Titus	002	011	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus	002	012	instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and
Titus	002	013	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our
Titus	002	014	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
Titus	002	015	Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority.
Titus	003	001	Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities,
Titus	003	002	to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle,
Titus	003	003	For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived,
Titus	003	004	But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love
Titus	003	005	not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves,
Titus	003	006	whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
Titus	003	007	that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs
Titus	003	008	This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I
Titus	003	009	but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes
Titus	003	010	Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
Titus	003	011	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
Titus	003	012	When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
Titus	003	013	Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily,
Titus	003	014	Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,
Titus	003	015	All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith.
Philemon	001	001	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
Philemon	001	002	to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier,
Philemon	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon	001	004	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
Philemon	001	005	hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward
Philemon	001	006	that the fellowship of your faith may become effective,
Philemon	001	007	For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts
Philemon	001	008	Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command
Philemon	001	009	yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul,
Philemon	001	010	I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in
Philemon	001	011	who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
Philemon	001	012	I am sending him back.  Therefore receive him, that is,
Philemon	001	013	whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might
Philemon	001	014	But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your
Philemon	001	015	For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while,
Philemon	001	016	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother,
Philemon	001	017	If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
Philemon	001	018	But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything,
Philemon	001	019	I, Paul, write this with my own hand:  I will repay it
Philemon	001	020	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord.
Philemon	001	021	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you,
Philemon	001	022	Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through
Philemon	001	023	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
Philemon	001	024	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon	001	025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.
Hebrews	001	001	God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets
Hebrews	001	002	has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son,
Hebrews	001	003	His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of
Hebrews	001	004	having become so much better than the angels, as he has
Hebrews	001	005	For to which of the angels did he say at any time, "You are my Son.
Hebrews	001	006	Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says,
Hebrews	001	007	Of the angels he says, "Who makes his angels winds, and his
Hebrews	001	008	But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
Hebrews	001	009	You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,
Hebrews	001	010	And, "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
Hebrews	001	011	They will perish, but you continue.  They all will grow old
Hebrews	001	012	As a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed;
Hebrews	001	013	But which of the angels has he told at any time, "Sit at
Hebrews	001	014	Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service
Hebrews	002	001	Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things
Hebrews	002	002	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every
Hebrews	002	003	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--
Hebrews	002	004	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders,
Hebrews	002	005	For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak,
Hebrews	002	006	But one has somewhere testified, saying, "What is man, that you
Hebrews	002	007	You made him a little lower than the angels.  You crowned him
Hebrews	002	008	You have put all things in subjection under his feet."{Psalm
Hebrews	002	009	But we see him who has been made a little lower than
Hebrews	002	010	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom
Hebrews	002	011	For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified
Hebrews	002	012	saying, "I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst
Hebrews	002	013	Again, "I will put my trust in him."{Isaiah 8:17} Again, "Behold,
Hebrews	002	014	Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood,
Hebrews	002	015	and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were
Hebrews	002	016	For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives
Hebrews	002	017	Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like
Hebrews	002	018	For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able
Hebrews	003	001	Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling,
Hebrews	003	002	who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses
Hebrews	003	003	For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
Hebrews	003	004	For every house is built by someone; but he who built all
Hebrews	003	005	Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant,
Hebrews	003	006	but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are,
Hebrews	003	007	Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you will
Hebrews	003	008	don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation, like as in
Hebrews	003	009	where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works
Hebrews	003	010	Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said,
Hebrews	003	011	as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into
Hebrews	003	012	Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you
Hebrews	003	013	but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;"
Hebrews	003	014	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast
Hebrews	003	015	while it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice,
Hebrews	003	016	For who, when they heard, rebelled?  No, didn't all those who
Hebrews	003	017	With whom was he displeased forty years?  Wasn't it with those
Hebrews	003	018	To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest,
Hebrews	003	019	We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews	004	001	Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem
Hebrews	004	002	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they
Hebrews	004	003	For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as
Hebrews	004	004	For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, "God rested
Hebrews	004	005	and in this place again, "They will not enter into
Hebrews	004	006	Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein,
Hebrews	004	007	he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David
Hebrews	004	008	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken
Hebrews	004	009	There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews	004	010	For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested
Hebrews	004	011	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest,
Hebrews	004	012	For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any
Hebrews	004	013	There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all
Hebrews	004	014	Having then a great high priest, who has passed through
Hebrews	004	015	For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with
Hebrews	004	016	Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace,
Hebrews	005	001	For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed
Hebrews	005	002	The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and
Hebrews	005	003	Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people,
Hebrews	005	004	Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God,
Hebrews	005	005	So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest,
Hebrews	005	006	As he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever,
Hebrews	005	007	He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and
Hebrews	005	008	though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things
Hebrews	005	009	Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey
Hebrews	005	010	named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews	005	011	About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret,
Hebrews	005	012	For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers,
Hebrews	005	013	For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word
Hebrews	005	014	But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason
Hebrews	006	001	Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ,
Hebrews	006	002	of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands,
Hebrews	006	003	This will we do, if God permits.
Hebrews	006	004	For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of
Hebrews	006	005	and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews	006	006	and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again
Hebrews	006	007	For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it,
Hebrews	006	008	but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near
Hebrews	006	009	But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you,
Hebrews	006	010	For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work
Hebrews	006	011	We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence
Hebrews	006	012	that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through
Hebrews	006	013	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear
Hebrews	006	014	saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I
Hebrews	006	015	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews	006	016	For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute
Hebrews	006	017	In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly
Hebrews	006	018	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God
Hebrews	006	019	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure
Hebrews	006	020	where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become
Hebrews	007	001	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High,
Hebrews	007	002	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first,
Hebrews	007	003	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither
Hebrews	007	004	Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham,
Hebrews	007	005	They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office
Hebrews	007	006	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted
Hebrews	007	007	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews	007	008	Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives
Hebrews	007	009	We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes,
Hebrews	007	010	for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews	007	011	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood
Hebrews	007	012	For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change
Hebrews	007	013	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe,
Hebrews	007	014	For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah,
Hebrews	007	015	This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness
Hebrews	007	016	who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment,
Hebrews	007	017	for it is testified, "You are a priest forever, according to
Hebrews	007	018	For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because
Hebrews	007	019	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a
Hebrews	007	020	Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
Hebrews	007	021	(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath),
Hebrews	007	022	By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.
Hebrews	007	023	Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered
Hebrews	007	024	But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
Hebrews	007	025	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw
Hebrews	007	026	For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless,
Hebrews	007	027	who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices
Hebrews	007	028	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness,
Hebrews	008	001	Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this.
Hebrews	008	002	a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle,
Hebrews	008	003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts
Hebrews	008	004	For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all,
Hebrews	008	005	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses
Hebrews	008	006	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry,
Hebrews	008	007	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place
Hebrews	008	008	For finding fault with them, he said, "Behold, the days come,"
Hebrews	008	009	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,
Hebrews	008	010	"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.
Hebrews	008	011	They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,{TR
Hebrews	008	012	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.  I will remember
Hebrews	008	013	In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old.
Hebrews	009	001	Now indeed even the first{TR adds "tabernacle"} covenant had
Hebrews	009	002	For a tabernacle was prepared.  In the first part were the lampstand,
Hebrews	009	003	After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called
Hebrews	009	004	having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant
Hebrews	009	005	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat,
Hebrews	009	006	Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in
Hebrews	009	007	but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year,
Hebrews	009	008	The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into
Hebrews	009	009	which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices
Hebrews	009	010	being only (with meats and drinks and various washings)
Hebrews	009	011	But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things,
Hebrews	009	012	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through
Hebrews	009	013	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer
Hebrews	009	014	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Hebrews	009	015	For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a
Hebrews	009	016	For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity
Hebrews	009	017	For a will is in force where there has been death, for it
Hebrews	009	018	Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated
Hebrews	009	019	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all
Hebrews	009	020	saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has
Hebrews	009	021	Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels
Hebrews	009	022	According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood,
Hebrews	009	023	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things
Hebrews	009	024	For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands,
Hebrews	009	025	nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
Hebrews	009	026	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation
Hebrews	009	027	Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once,
Hebrews	009	028	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many,
Hebrews	010	001	For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very
Hebrews	010	002	Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered,
Hebrews	010	003	But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.
Hebrews	010	004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should
Hebrews	010	005	Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, "Sacrifice and
Hebrews	010	006	You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
Hebrews	010	007	Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book
Hebrews	010	008	Previously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole
Hebrews	010	009	then he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will."
Hebrews	010	010	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering
Hebrews	010	011	Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering
Hebrews	010	012	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,
Hebrews	010	013	from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool
Hebrews	010	014	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who
Hebrews	010	015	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
Hebrews	010	016	"This is the covenant that I will make with them:
Hebrews	010	017	"I will remember their sins and their iniquities
Hebrews	010	018	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
Hebrews	010	019	Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy
Hebrews	010	020	by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way,
Hebrews	010	021	and having a great priest over the house of God,
Hebrews	010	022	let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith,
Hebrews	010	023	let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering;
Hebrews	010	024	Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,
Hebrews	010	025	not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom
Hebrews	010	026	For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge
Hebrews	010	027	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness
Hebrews	010	028	A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on
Hebrews	010	029	How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged
Hebrews	010	030	For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me,"
Hebrews	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews	010	032	But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened,
Hebrews	010	033	partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions;
Hebrews	010	034	For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully
Hebrews	010	035	Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.
Hebrews	010	036	For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God,
Hebrews	010	037	"In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.
Hebrews	010	038	But the righteous will live by faith.  If he shrinks back,
Hebrews	010	039	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction,
Hebrews	011	001	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of
Hebrews	011	002	For by this, the elders obtained testimony.
Hebrews	011	003	By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed
Hebrews	011	004	By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
Hebrews	011	005	By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death,
Hebrews	011	006	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him,
Hebrews	011	007	By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen,
Hebrews	011	008	By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out
Hebrews	011	009	By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in
Hebrews	011	010	For he looked for the city which has the foundations,
Hebrews	011	011	By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive,
Hebrews	011	012	Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude,
Hebrews	011	013	These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
Hebrews	011	014	For those who say such things make it clear that they are
Hebrews	011	015	If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they
Hebrews	011	016	But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
Hebrews	011	017	By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac.
Hebrews	011	018	even he to whom it was said, "In Isaac will your seed
Hebrews	011	019	concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead.
Hebrews	011	020	By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning
Hebrews	011	021	By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons
Hebrews	011	022	By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of
Hebrews	011	023	By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months
Hebrews	011	024	By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called
Hebrews	011	025	choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people,
Hebrews	011	026	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
Hebrews	011	027	By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king;
Hebrews	011	028	By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood,
Hebrews	011	029	By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land.
Hebrews	011	030	By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been
Hebrews	011	031	By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who
Hebrews	011	032	What more shall I say?  For the time would fail me if I told
Hebrews	011	033	who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness,
Hebrews	011	034	quenched the power of fire,{Daniel 3:1-30} escaped the edge
Hebrews	011	035	Women received their dead by resurrection.{1 Kings 19:1-3;
Hebrews	011	036	Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by
Hebrews	011	037	They were stoned.{2 Chronicles 24:20-21} They were sawn apart.
Hebrews	011	038	(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts,
Hebrews	011	039	These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith,
Hebrews	011	040	God having provided some better thing concerning us,
Hebrews	012	001	Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great
Hebrews	012	002	looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
Hebrews	012	003	For consider him who has endured such contradiction
Hebrews	012	004	You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
Hebrews	012	005	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you
Hebrews	012	006	For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son
Hebrews	012	007	It is for discipline that you endure.  God deals with
Hebrews	012	008	But if you are without discipline, of which all have been
Hebrews	012	009	Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us,
Hebrews	012	010	For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them;
Hebrews	012	011	All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous;
Hebrews	012	012	Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the
Hebrews	012	013	and make straight paths for your feet,{Proverbs 4:26} so that
Hebrews	012	014	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without
Hebrews	012	015	looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace
Hebrews	012	016	lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person,

Hebrews	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews	013	002	Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so,
Hebrews	013	003	Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them;
Hebrews	013	004	Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let
Hebrews	013	005	Be free from the love of money, content with such things
Hebrews	013	006	So that with good courage we say, "The Lord is my helper.
Hebrews	013	007	Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God,
Hebrews	013	008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
Hebrews	013	009	Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it

Hebrews	013	015	Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise
Hebrews	013	016	But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such
Hebrews	013	017	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch
Hebrews	013	018	Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience,
Hebrews	013	019	I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored
Hebrews	013	020	Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great
Hebrews	013	021	make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you
Hebrews	013	022	But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation,
Hebrews	013	023	Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom,
Hebrews	013	024	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints.
Hebrews	013	025	Grace be with you all.  Amen.

James	003	003	Indeed, we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may
James	003	004	Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven
James	003	005	So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things.
James	003	006	And the tongue is a fire.  The world of iniquity among
James	003	007	For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing
James	003	008	But nobody can tame the tongue.  It is a restless evil,
James	003	009	With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men,
James	003	010	Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing.
James	003	011	Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
James	003	012	Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs?
James	003	013	Who is wise and understanding among you?  Let him show by his
James	003	014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart,
James	003	015	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above,
James	003	016	For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion
James	003	017	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful,
James	003	018	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those
James	004	001	Where do wars and fightings among you come from?
James	004	002	You lust, and don't have.  You kill, covet, and can't obtain.
James	004	003	You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives,
James	004	004	You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship

James	004	010	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
James	004	011	Don't speak against one another, brothers.  He who speaks
James	004	012	Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.
James	004	013	Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let's go into this city,
James	004	014	Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow.
James	004	015	For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live,
James	004	016	But now you glory in your boasting.  All such boasting is evil.
James	004	017	To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn't do it,
James	005	001	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are
James	005	002	Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.

James	005	005	You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure.
James	005	006	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one.
James	005	007	Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord.
James	005	008	You also be patient.  Establish your hearts, for the coming
James	005	009	Don't grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you
James	005	010	Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience,

James	005	014	Is any among you sick?  Let him call for the elders of the assembly,

1 Peter	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Peter	001	004	to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't
1 Peter	001	005	who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation
1 Peter	001	006	Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while,
1 Peter	001	007	that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold
1 Peter	001	008	whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you
1 Peter	001	009	receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter	001	010	Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched
1 Peter	001	011	searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ,
1 Peter	001	012	To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you,
1 Peter	001	013	Therefore, prepare your minds for action,{literally, "gird up
1 Peter	001	014	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according
1 Peter	001	015	but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be
1 Peter	001	016	because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I
1 Peter	001	017	If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons
1 Peter	001	018	knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things,
1 Peter	001	019	but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb,
1 Peter	001	020	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world,
1 Peter	001	021	who through him are believers in God, who raised him from
1 Peter	001	022	Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to
1 Peter	001	023	having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
1 Peter	001	024	For, "All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the
1 Peter	001	025	but the Lord's word endures forever."{Isaiah 40:6-8} This
1 Peter	002	001	Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies,
1 Peter	002	002	as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word,
1 Peter	002	003	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
1 Peter	002	004	coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men,
1 Peter	002	005	You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house,
1 Peter	002	006	Because it is contained in Scripture, "Behold, I lay

1 Peter	002	009	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
1 Peter	002	010	who in time past were no people, but now are God's people,
1 Peter	002	011	Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain
1 Peter	002	012	having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they
1 Peter	002	013	Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for
1 Peter	002	014	or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers
1 Peter	002	015	For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put
1 Peter	002	016	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness,
1 Peter	002	017	Honor all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God.
1 Peter	002	018	Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear;
1 Peter	002	019	For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly,
1 Peter	002	020	For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating?
1 Peter	002	021	For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us,
1 Peter	002	022	who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."{Isaiah 53:9}
1 Peter	002	023	Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back.  When he suffered,
1 Peter	002	024	who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree,

1 Peter	003	001	In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
1 Peter	003	002	seeing your pure behavior in fear.
1 Peter	003	003	Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding
1 Peter	003	004	but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible
1 Peter	003	005	For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also
1 Peter	003	006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you
1 Peter	003	007	You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according
1 Peter	003	008	Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as
1 Peter	003	009	not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling;
1 Peter	003	010	For, "He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep
1 Peter	003	011	Let him turn away from evil, and do good.  Let him seek peace,
1 Peter	003	012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears
1 Peter	003	013	Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators
1 Peter	003	014	But even if you should suffer for righteousness'
1 Peter	003	015	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready
1 Peter	003	016	having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against
1 Peter	003	017	For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing
1 Peter	003	018	Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous
1 Peter	003	019	in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,
1 Peter	003	020	who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently
1 Peter	003	021	This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you--
1 Peter	003	022	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
1 Peter	004	001	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh,
1 Peter	004	002	that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh
1 Peter	004	003	For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire
1 Peter	004	004	They think it is strange that you don't run with them into
1 Peter	004	005	who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living
1 Peter	004	006	For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead,
1 Peter	004	007	But the end of all things is near.  Therefore be of sound mind,
1 Peter	004	008	And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves,
1 Peter	004	009	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter	004	010	As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another,
1 Peter	004	011	If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God.
1 Peter	004	012	Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has
1 Peter	004	013	But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice;
1 Peter	004	014	If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed;
1 Peter	004	015	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief,
1 Peter	004	016	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not
1 Peter	004	017	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household
1 Peter	004	018	"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen
1 Peter	004	019	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will
1 Peter	005	001	I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness
1 Peter	005	002	Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising
1 Peter	005	003	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you,
1 Peter	005	004	When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown
1 Peter	005	005	Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder.
1 Peter	005	006	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
1 Peter	005	007	casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
1 Peter	005	008	Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful.  Your adversary
1 Peter	005	009	Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers

2 Peter	001	014	knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly,
2 Peter	001	015	Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able

2 Peter	001	019	We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you
2 Peter	001	020	knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is
2 Peter	001	021	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man:  but holy men
2 Peter	002	001	But false prophets also arose among the people, as false
2 Peter	002	002	Many will follow their immoral{TR reads "destructive"
2 Peter	002	003	In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words:
2 Peter	002	004	For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned, but cast
2 Peter	002	005	and didn't spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with
2 Peter	002	006	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes,
2 Peter	002	007	and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful
2 Peter	002	008	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented
2 Peter	002	009	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to
2 Peter	002	010	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement,
2 Peter	002	011	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring
2 Peter	002	012	But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be
2 Peter	002	013	receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count
2 Peter	002	014	having eyes full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin;
2 Peter	002	015	forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way
2 Peter	002	016	but he was rebuked for his own disobedience.  A mute donkey spoke
2 Peter	002	017	These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm;
2 Peter	002	018	For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice
2 Peter	002	019	promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants
2 Peter	002	020	For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world
2 Peter	002	021	For it would be better for them not to have known the way
2 Peter	002	022	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb,
2 Peter	003	001	This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you;
2 Peter	003	002	that you should remember the words which were spoken before
2 Peter	003	003	knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come,
2 Peter	003	004	and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming?  For, from the day
2 Peter	003	005	For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from
2 Peter	003	006	by which means the world that then was, being overflowed
2 Peter	003	007	But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word
2 Peter	003	008	But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day
2 Peter	003	009	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness;
2 Peter	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
2 Peter	003	011	Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this,
2 Peter	003	012	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God,
2 Peter	003	013	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a
2 Peter	003	014	Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things,
2 Peter	003	015	Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved
2 Peter	003	016	as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things.
2 Peter	003	017	You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand,

1 John	001	005	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce
1 John	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness,
1 John	001	007	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
1 John	001	008	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
1 John	001	009	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive
1 John	001	010	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar,
1 John	002	001	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may
1 John	002	002	And he is the atoning sacrifice{"atoning sacrifice"
1 John	002	003	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.
1 John	002	004	One who says, "I know him," and doesn't keep his commandments,
1 John	002	005	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been

1 John	002	007	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old
1 John	002	008	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true
1 John	002	009	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother,
1 John	002	010	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there
1 John	002	011	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks
1 John	002	012	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
1 John	002	013	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from
1 John	002	014	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is
1 John	002	015	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world.
1 John	002	016	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust
1 John	002	017	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does
1 John	002	018	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that
1 John	002	019	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they
1 John	002	020	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.
1 John	002	021	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth,
1 John	002	022	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is
1 John	002	023	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father.
1 John	002	024	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you
1 John	002	025	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.
1 John	002	026	These things I have written to you concerning those who would
1 John	002	027	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains
1 John	002	028	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears,
1 John	002	029	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone
1 John	003	001	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us,
1 John	003	002	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed
1 John	003	003	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself,
1 John	003	004	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.
1 John	003	005	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him
1 John	003	006	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him,
1 John	003	007	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does
1 John	003	008	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning
1 John	003	009	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed
1 John	003	010	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children
1 John	003	011	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning,
1 John	003	012	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother.
1 John	003	013	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
1 John	003	014	We know that we have passed out of death into life,
1 John	003	015	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
1 John	003	016	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us.
1 John	003	017	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need,
1 John	003	018	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with
1 John	003	019	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade
1 John	003	020	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart,
1 John	003	021	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;
1 John	003	022	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his
1 John	003	023	This is his commandment, that we should believe in
1 John	003	024	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him.
1 John	004	001	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits,
1 John	004	002	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses
1 John	004	003	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has
1 John	004	004	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them;
1 John	004	005	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world,
1 John	004	006	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us.
1 John	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God;
1 John	004	008	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.
1 John	004	009	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one
1 John	004	010	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
1 John	004	011	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to
1 John	004	012	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another,
1 John	004	013	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us,
