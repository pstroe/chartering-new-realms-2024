Colossians	1	1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, also a follower of the Lord.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	2	To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	3	Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	4	now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	6	bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	7	It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	8	and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	9	And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	10	Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;	1	OEB
Colossians	1	11	you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;	1	OEB
Colossians	1	12	and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	13	For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his love,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	14	and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	15	For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – firstborn and head of all creation;	1	OEB
Colossians	1	16	for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	17	All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;	1	OEB
Colossians	1	18	and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The firstborn from the dead, he is to the church the source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	21	And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –	1	OEB
Colossians	1	22	but now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	23	if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	24	Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;	1	OEB
Colossians	1	25	of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –	1	OEB
Colossians	1	26	that truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,	1	OEB
Colossians	1	27	to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – ‘Christ among you! Your hope of glory!’	1	OEB
Colossians	1	28	This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.	1	OEB
Colossians	1	29	It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	1	I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;	1	OEB
Colossians	2	2	in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,	1	OEB
Colossians	2	3	even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	4	I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	5	It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	6	Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –	1	OEB
Colossians	2	7	rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	8	Take care that there is not someone who will carry you away by his ‘philosophy’ – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	9	For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;	1	OEB
Colossians	2	10	and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	11	By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	12	For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	13	And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!	1	OEB
Colossians	2	14	He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!	1	OEB
Colossians	2	15	He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!	1	OEB
Colossians	2	16	Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	17	These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	18	Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called ‘humility’ and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	19	They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	20	Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,	1	OEB
Colossians	2	21	to such ordinances as ‘Do not handle, or taste, or touch’?	1	OEB
Colossians	2	22	For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.	1	OEB
Colossians	2	23	Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	1	Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	2	Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	3	For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	4	When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	5	Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	6	These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,	1	OEB
Colossians	3	7	and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	8	You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	9	Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,	1	OEB
Colossians	3	10	and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	11	In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all!	1	OEB
Colossians	3	12	Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;	1	OEB
Colossians	3	13	bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	14	Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	15	Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	16	Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	17	And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	18	Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	20	Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	21	Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	22	Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,	1	OEB
Colossians	3	24	since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.	1	OEB
Colossians	3	25	Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	1	Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	2	Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;	1	OEB
Colossians	4	3	and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains!	1	OEB
Colossians	4	4	Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	5	Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	6	Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	7	Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	8	I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	9	With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	10	My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)	1	OEB
Colossians	4	11	Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	13	I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	14	Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	15	Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	16	And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.	1	OEB
Colossians	4	17	Give this message to Archippus – ‘Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master’s cause.’	1	OEB
Colossians	4	18	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God’s blessing be with you.	1	OEB
Ephesians	1	1	To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	4	For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	5	From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	6	and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	7	for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	8	All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	9	when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	10	in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, center in him.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	11	In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	12	that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	13	And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	14	And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	15	And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	16	have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	17	My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	18	that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	19	and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	20	The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	21	and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	22	And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;	2	OEB
Ephesians	1	23	for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	1	You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	2	For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	3	And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	4	Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	5	even though we were dead because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	6	And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	7	in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	8	For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	9	It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	10	For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	11	Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘the Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘the Circumcised’ – circumcised only by human hands!	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	12	Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the covenants founded on God’s promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	13	But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	14	He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	15	and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	16	And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	17	He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	18	for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	19	It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s household.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	20	You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	21	United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.	2	OEB
Ephesians	2	22	And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	2	For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	3	and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	4	And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	5	In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	6	That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	7	Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	8	Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	9	and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	10	so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	11	in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	12	And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	14	For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	15	from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	16	and pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	17	so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; and I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	18	have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	19	and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled with all the fullness of God.	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	20	To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –	2	OEB
Ephesians	3	21	to him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	1	I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	2	always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	3	and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	4	There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	5	There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	6	There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	7	Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	8	That is why it is said –	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	9	Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	10	He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	11	And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	12	to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	13	And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	14	Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	15	but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	16	For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	17	This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	18	with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	19	Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	20	But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	21	and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	22	For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	23	that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	24	and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	25	Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	26	Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	27	and give no opportunity to the devil.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	28	Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	29	Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.	2	OEB
Ephesians	4	32	Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	1	Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	2	and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	3	As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	4	nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	5	For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	6	Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	7	Therefore have nothing to do with such people.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	8	For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	9	for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	10	always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	11	Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	12	It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	13	All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	14	For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said –	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	15	Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	16	making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	18	Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	19	Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	20	Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	21	Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	22	Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	23	For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Savior of his body.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	24	But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	26	to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	27	so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	28	That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	29	for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	30	for we are members of his body.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	31	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	32	In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.	2	OEB
Ephesians	5	33	However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	2	‘Honor your father and mother’ – this is the first Commandment with a promise –	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	3	‘so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.’	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	4	And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	6	not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	7	Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	8	for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	9	And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	10	For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	12	For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	13	Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	14	Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breastplate,	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	15	and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	16	At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	17	And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	18	Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	19	and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	20	on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	21	To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the Master’s cause, will tell you everything.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	22	I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	23	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower peace, and love linked with faith.	2	OEB
Ephesians	6	24	May God’s blessing be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.	2	OEB
Esther	1	1	These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia	3	OEB
Esther	1	2	from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.	3	OEB
Esther	1	3	In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present	3	OEB
Esther	1	4	while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.	3	OEB
Esther	1	5	When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.	3	OEB
Esther	1	6	There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.	3	OEB
Esther	1	7	Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.	3	OEB
Esther	1	8	The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.	3	OEB
Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.	3	OEB
Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants	3	OEB
Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.	3	OEB
Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.	3	OEB
Esther	1	13	The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.	3	OEB
Esther	1	14	Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.	3	OEB
Esther	1	15	“Queen Vashti”, the king said, “has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?”	3	OEB
Esther	1	16	Memucan replied before the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.	3	OEB
Esther	1	17	The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!’	3	OEB
Esther	1	18	This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife!	3	OEB
Esther	1	19	If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.	3	OEB
Esther	1	20	When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honor to their husbands.”	3	OEB
Esther	1	21	The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.	3	OEB
Esther	1	22	He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!	3	OEB
Esther	2	1	Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.	3	OEB
Esther	2	2	Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,	3	OEB
Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,	3	OEB
Esther	2	4	and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.	3	OEB
Esther	2	5	In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.	3	OEB
Esther	2	6	(Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)	3	OEB
Esther	2	7	Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.	3	OEB
Esther	2	8	When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.	3	OEB
Esther	2	9	The girl pleased him and gained his favor, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.	3	OEB
Esther	2	10	Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.	3	OEB
Esther	2	11	Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.	3	OEB
Esther	2	12	The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,	3	OEB
Esther	2	13	each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,	3	OEB
Esther	2	14	and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.	3	OEB
Esther	2	15	When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.	3	OEB
Esther	2	16	Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	3	OEB
Esther	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favorite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.	3	OEB
Esther	2	18	Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honor of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.	3	OEB
Esther	2	19	All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.	3	OEB
Esther	2	20	Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.	3	OEB
Esther	2	21	In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.	3	OEB
Esther	2	22	But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.	3	OEB
Esther	2	23	When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.	3	OEB
Esther	3	1	After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.	3	OEB
Esther	3	2	All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.	3	OEB
Esther	3	3	Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”	3	OEB
Esther	3	4	When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.	3	OEB
Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.	3	OEB
Esther	3	6	But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.	3	OEB
Esther	3	7	In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had ‘pur’ (which means ‘lot’) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.	3	OEB
Esther	3	8	So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.	3	OEB
Esther	3	9	If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.”	3	OEB
Esther	3	10	So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.	3	OEB
Esther	3	11	“The money is yours,” the king said to Haman, “and the people also to do with them as you wish.”	3	OEB
Esther	3	12	And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.	3	OEB
Esther	3	13	Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.	3	OEB
Esther	3	14	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.	3	OEB
Esther	3	15	By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.	3	OEB
Esther	4	1	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.	3	OEB
Esther	4	2	He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.	3	OEB
Esther	4	3	In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.	3	OEB
Esther	4	4	When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behavior, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.	3	OEB
Esther	4	5	So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.	3	OEB
Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.	3	OEB
Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.	3	OEB
Esther	4	8	Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.	3	OEB
Esther	4	9	When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,	3	OEB
Esther	4	10	she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,	3	OEB
Esther	4	11	“All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.”	3	OEB
Esther	4	12	When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,	3	OEB
Esther	4	13	he sent back this reply to Esther, “Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.	3	OEB
Esther	4	14	If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!”	3	OEB
Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:	3	OEB
Esther	4	16	“Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.”	3	OEB
Esther	4	17	Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.	3	OEB
Esther	5	1	On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.	3	OEB
Esther	5	2	When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favor, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.	3	OEB
Esther	5	3	Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	4	“If it seems best to the king,” Esther said, “let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	5	Then the king ordered, “Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	6	While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	7	Esther answered,	3	OEB
Esther	5	8	“If I have won the king’s favor and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	9	Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.	3	OEB
Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife	3	OEB
Esther	5	11	and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.	3	OEB
Esther	5	12	“What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.	3	OEB
Esther	5	13	Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”	3	OEB
Esther	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.	3	OEB
Esther	6	1	On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king.	3	OEB
Esther	6	2	It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.	3	OEB
Esther	6	3	“What honor and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?” the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied “Nothing has been done for him,”	3	OEB
Esther	6	4	the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.	3	OEB
Esther	6	5	So the king’s pages said to him, “Haman is standing there, in the court.” The king said, “Let him enter.”	3	OEB
Esther	6	6	So Haman entered, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom besides me could the king wish to honor?”	3	OEB
Esther	6	7	So he said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor	3	OEB
Esther	6	8	let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.	3	OEB
Esther	6	9	Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’”	3	OEB
Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.”	3	OEB
Esther	6	11	So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.”	3	OEB
Esther	6	12	Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.	3	OEB
Esther	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.”	3	OEB
Esther	6	14	While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	3	OEB
Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther.	3	OEB
Esther	7	2	As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.”	3	OEB
Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if I have won your favor, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request,	3	OEB
Esther	7	4	for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.”	3	OEB
Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?”	3	OEB
Esther	7	6	“A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.” Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen.	3	OEB
Esther	7	7	In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him.	3	OEB
Esther	7	8	As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, “Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?”	3	OEB
Esther	7	9	and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, “There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!” The king said “Hang him on them.”	3	OEB
Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified.	3	OEB
Esther	8	1	At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her.	3	OEB
Esther	8	2	The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.	3	OEB
Esther	8	3	Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.	3	OEB
Esther	8	4	The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.	3	OEB
Esther	8	5	“If it seems best to the king,” she said, “and if I have won his favor and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.	3	OEB
Esther	8	6	For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?”	3	OEB
Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.	3	OEB
Esther	8	8	Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”	3	OEB
Esther	8	9	On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.	3	OEB
Esther	8	10	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.	3	OEB
Esther	8	11	In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder	3	OEB
Esther	8	12	throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).	3	OEB
Esther	8	13	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.	3	OEB
Esther	8	14	So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands!	3	OEB
Esther	8	15	and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.	3	OEB
Esther	8	16	To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honor.	3	OEB
Esther	8	17	And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	2	The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.	3	OEB
Esther	9	3	All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.	3	OEB
Esther	9	5	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	6	In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.	3	OEB
Esther	9	7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,	3	OEB
Esther	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,	3	OEB
Esther	9	9	Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,	3	OEB
Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.	3	OEB
Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,	3	OEB
Esther	9	12	and the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.”	3	OEB
Esther	9	13	“If it please the king,” Esther said, “let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”	3	OEB
Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.	3	OEB
Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.	3	OEB
Esther	9	16	And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.	3	OEB
Esther	9	17	This was on the thirteenth day of Adar.	3	OEB
Esther	9	18	(But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)	3	OEB
Esther	9	19	This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.	3	OEB
Esther	9	20	Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.	3	OEB
Esther	9	21	He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,	3	OEB
Esther	9	22	as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.	3	OEB
Esther	9	23	So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast ‘Pur’, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.	3	OEB
Esther	9	25	But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.	3	OEB
Esther	9	26	This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,	3	OEB
Esther	9	27	the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,	3	OEB
Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.	3	OEB
Esther	9	29	Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.	3	OEB
Esther	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,	3	OEB
Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.	3	OEB
Esther	9	32	And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.	3	OEB
Esther	10	1	King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.	3	OEB
Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?	3	OEB
Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.	3	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	1	To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	2	from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	3	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	4	I always thank God for you. I thank him for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	5	For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	6	and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	7	There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	8	And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	9	God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	10	But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	12	I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	13	You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	14	I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	15	so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	16	I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	17	My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	18	The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are on the path to ruin, but to us who are on the path of salvation it is the power of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	19	For scripture says –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	21	For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	22	While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	23	we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	24	but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	25	For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	26	Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	27	but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	28	and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	29	so that in his presence no one should boast.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	30	But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	1	31	so that – in the words of scripture –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	1	For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	2	for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything except Jesus Christ – and him crucified!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	3	Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	4	My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	6	Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	7	No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	8	This philosophy is clearly not known to any of the leaders of today, since, had they known it, they would never have crucified our glorious Lord!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	9	It is what scripture speaks of as –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	10	Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	11	For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	12	And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	13	And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	14	The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	15	But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	2	16	For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	1	But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	3	While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	4	When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	5	What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	7	Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	8	In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	10	In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	11	for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	12	Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	13	the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	14	If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	15	If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	16	Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	17	If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	19	For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	20	And it says again –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	3	23	But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	1	Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	2	Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	3	But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	4	for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	6	All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	7	For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	8	Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	9	For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	10	We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	11	To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	12	we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	13	we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	14	It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	15	Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	17	This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	18	Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	19	But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	20	for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	1	There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	2	Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	3	For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	4	I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	5	to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little yeast leavens all the dough?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	7	Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	8	therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	9	I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	10	not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	11	But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	12	What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	5	13	while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	1	Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	2	Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	3	Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	4	Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	5	Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	6	Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	7	To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	8	Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	9	Don’t you know that wrongdoers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	10	or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	11	Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	12	Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	13	Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	14	and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise us up also by the exercise of his power.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	15	Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	16	Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	17	while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	18	Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	19	Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	6	20	Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	1	With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	2	But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	3	A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	4	It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	6	I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	7	I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	8	My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	9	But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	10	To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	11	(If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	12	To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	13	and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	14	For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	15	However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	16	How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	17	In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	18	Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	20	Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	22	For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	24	Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	25	With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	26	I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	28	Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	29	What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	30	those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	33	while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	34	and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	35	I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter around your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	36	If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	37	On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	38	In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	7	40	Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	1	With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	2	If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	3	On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	4	With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	5	Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	6	Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	7	Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	8	What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	9	But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	10	For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	11	And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	12	In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	3	The defense that I make to my critics is this:	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	4	Haven’t we a right to food and drink?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	5	Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	7	Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	8	Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	9	For in the Law of Moses it is said –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	10	Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the plowman ought not to plow, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	11	Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	12	If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	13	Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	14	So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	15	I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	16	If I proclaim the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not share it!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	17	If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	19	Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	21	To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	23	And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	24	Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	25	Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	26	I, therefore, do not run aimlessly. I do not box like a man hitting the air.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	9	27	No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	1	I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	2	that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	3	and that they all ate the same supernatural food,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	5	Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	7	Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	8	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	9	Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by snakes.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	10	And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	11	These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	16	In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	17	The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	18	Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	19	What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	20	No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	21	You cannot drink both the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	22	Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	23	Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	24	A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	25	Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	26	for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	27	If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	28	But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	29	I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	30	If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	32	Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	10	33	for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	1	Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	2	I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	3	But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	4	Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonors him who is his head;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	5	while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonors him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	6	Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	7	A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	8	For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	9	Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	10	And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	11	Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	12	for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	14	Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	15	a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	16	If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	17	In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	18	To begin with, I am told that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you. In part I believe this,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	19	indeed, there must be parties among you, so that the people of real worth become known.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	20	When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	21	for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	22	Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	23	For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	24	and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said  “This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.”	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	25	And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying  “This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.”	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	26	For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offense against the Lord’s body and blood.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	28	Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	29	For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	30	That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	31	But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	32	Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	33	Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	1	In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	4	Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	5	ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	6	results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	7	To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	8	To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	10	to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	11	All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	12	For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	13	for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	14	The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	16	Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	17	If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	18	But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	19	If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	20	But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	21	The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	22	No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	23	and those parts which we deem less honorable we surround with special honor; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	24	Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honor to the part that lacks it –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	25	As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	26	If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honor done to it, all the others share its joy.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	27	Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	28	In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	29	Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	30	Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	12	31	Strive for the greater gifts.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	1	Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	2	Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	3	Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	5	love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	6	love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	7	love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will end; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will vanish.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	9	For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	10	but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will end.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	12	As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	13	13	Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	1	Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	2	The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	3	But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	4	Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	6	This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	7	Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	8	If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	9	And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	11	If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	12	And so with you; since you are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ should pray for ability to interpret them.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	14	If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	15	What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	16	If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	17	Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	18	Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	19	But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	20	My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	21	It is said in the Law –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	22	Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	23	So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	24	While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	25	the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	26	What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	27	If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	28	If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	29	Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	30	But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	31	For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	32	(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	34	At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	35	If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	36	What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	38	Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	14	40	Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	1	Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	2	and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	3	For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	6	After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	7	After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	8	Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, a miscarried baby – born untimely.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	10	But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	12	Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	13	But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	14	and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	15	Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	16	For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	17	and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	18	Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	19	If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	20	But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	21	For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	22	For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	24	Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be overthrown is death;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	27	for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	28	And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	29	Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	30	Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	31	Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	32	If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	34	Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	35	Someone, however, may ask ‘How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	36	You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies!	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	37	And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	38	God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	39	All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	40	There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	41	There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	42	It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	43	sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	44	As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	45	That is what is meant by the words – ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	46	That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterward comes the spiritual;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	47	the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	48	Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	50	This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	51	Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	52	at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	54	And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	55	‘death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?’	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	56	It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	1	With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	3	On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	4	and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	5	I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	6	And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	7	I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	8	I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	9	for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	10	If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	11	No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	12	As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	13	Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	14	Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	15	I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	16	I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	17	I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	18	they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	19	The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	20	All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	21	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	22	Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	23	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.	4	OEB
1 Corinthians	16	24	My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.	4	OEB
1 John	1	1	We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.	5	OEB
1 John	1	2	That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.	5	OEB
1 John	1	3	It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.	5	OEB
1 John	1	4	We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete.	5	OEB
1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.	5	OEB
1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.	5	OEB
1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.	5	OEB
1 John	1	8	If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	5	OEB
1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing.	5	OEB
1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us.	5	OEB
1 John	2	1	My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous.	5	OEB
1 John	2	2	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.	5	OEB
1 John	2	3	It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him.	5	OEB
1 John	2	4	Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.	5	OEB
1 John	2	5	But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:	5	OEB
1 John	2	6	whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.	5	OEB
1 John	2	7	Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard.	5	OEB
1 John	2	8	Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.	5	OEB
1 John	2	9	The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.	5	OEB
1 John	2	10	The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.	5	OEB
1 John	2	11	The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.	5	OEB
1 John	2	12	Little children, I am writing to you	5	OEB
1 John	2	13	Parents, I am writing to you	5	OEB
1 John	2	14	Parents, I write to you	5	OEB
1 John	2	15	Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.	5	OEB
1 John	2	16	For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.	5	OEB
1 John	2	17	And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever.	5	OEB
1 John	2	18	My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour.	5	OEB
1 John	2	19	These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us.	5	OEB
1 John	2	20	You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth.	5	OEB
1 John	2	21	I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.	5	OEB
1 John	2	22	Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son.	5	OEB
1 John	2	23	No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also.	5	OEB
1 John	2	24	As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.	5	OEB
1 John	2	25	And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life!	5	OEB
1 John	2	26	In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.	5	OEB
1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him.	5	OEB
1 John	2	28	Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming.	5	OEB
1 John	2	29	Since you know he is righteous, you realize that everyone who does what is right is his child.	5	OEB
1 John	3	1	See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.	5	OEB
1 John	3	2	Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.	5	OEB
1 John	3	3	And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.	5	OEB
1 John	3	4	Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.	5	OEB
1 John	3	5	You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.	5	OEB
1 John	3	6	No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.	5	OEB
1 John	3	7	My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.	5	OEB
1 John	3	8	The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.	5	OEB
1 John	3	9	No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.	5	OEB
1 John	3	10	By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.	5	OEB
1 John	3	11	For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another.	5	OEB
1 John	3	12	We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.	5	OEB
1 John	3	13	Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you.	5	OEB
1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death.	5	OEB
1 John	3	15	The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.	5	OEB
1 John	3	16	This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other.	5	OEB
1 John	3	17	If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?	5	OEB
1 John	3	18	My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions.	5	OEB
1 John	3	19	This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence:	5	OEB
1 John	3	20	though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.	5	OEB
1 John	3	21	Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,	5	OEB
1 John	3	22	and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him.	5	OEB
1 John	3	23	His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us.	5	OEB
1 John	3	24	The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us.	5	OEB
1 John	4	1	Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.	5	OEB
1 John	4	2	This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,	5	OEB
1 John	4	3	while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world!	5	OEB
1 John	4	4	You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.	5	OEB
1 John	4	5	Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.	5	OEB
1 John	4	6	We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.	5	OEB
1 John	4	7	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.	5	OEB
1 John	4	8	Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.	5	OEB
1 John	4	9	This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.	5	OEB
1 John	4	10	This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.	5	OEB
1 John	4	11	Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.	5	OEB
1 John	4	12	No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.	5	OEB
1 John	4	13	We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.	5	OEB
1 John	4	14	Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.	5	OEB
1 John	4	15	Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.	5	OEB
1 John	4	16	And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us.	5	OEB
1 John	4	17	This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.	5	OEB
1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.	5	OEB
1 John	4	19	We love, because God first loved us.	5	OEB
1 John	4	20	If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.	5	OEB
1 John	4	21	Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.	5	OEB
1 John	5	1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.	5	OEB
1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.	5	OEB
1 John	5	3	For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,	5	OEB
1 John	5	4	for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith!	5	OEB
1 John	5	5	Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	5	OEB
1 John	5	6	Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.	5	OEB
1 John	5	7	Indeed three testify:	5	OEB
1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree.	5	OEB
1 John	5	9	We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.	5	OEB
1 John	5	10	The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.	5	OEB
1 John	5	11	And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	5	OEB
1 John	5	12	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life.	5	OEB
1 John	5	13	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.	5	OEB
1 John	5	14	We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.	5	OEB
1 John	5	15	And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours.	5	OEB
1 John	5	16	If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.	5	OEB
1 John	5	17	All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.	5	OEB
1 John	5	18	We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them.	5	OEB
1 John	5	19	We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.	5	OEB
1 John	5	20	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.	5	OEB
1 John	5	21	My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.	5	OEB
1 Peter	1	1	To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	2	and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	4	given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	5	for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	6	At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	7	that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	8	Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	9	as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	10	It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	11	as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	12	And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	13	Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	14	Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	15	but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	16	For scripture says –	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	17	And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	18	For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	19	but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	20	Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	21	who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	22	Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	23	since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	24	For –	6	OEB
1 Peter	1	25	but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	1	Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	2	like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	3	since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	4	Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	5	and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	6	For there is a passage of scripture that runs –	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	7	It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	8	and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	9	But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	10	Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	11	Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	12	Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evildoers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	13	Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	14	and to governors as sent by him to punish evildoers and to commend those who do right.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	15	For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	16	Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	17	Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	18	Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	19	For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	20	What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	21	For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	22	He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	23	He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	24	And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	2	25	Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	1	Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	2	as they see your pure, reverent conduct.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	3	Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	4	but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	5	It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	6	as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	7	Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	8	Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	9	never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing!	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	10	‘The person who wants to enjoy life	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	11	they should turn from evil and do good,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	13	Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	14	Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	15	Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	16	and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	17	It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	18	For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	19	And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	20	who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	21	And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,	6	OEB
1 Peter	3	22	who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	1	Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	2	and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	3	Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	4	And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	5	But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	6	For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	8	Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	9	Never grudge hospitality to one another.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	10	Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	11	When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	12	Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	13	No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	14	If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	15	I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	16	But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name.	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	18	If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’	6	OEB
1 Peter	4	19	Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	1	As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	2	I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	3	not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	4	Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	5	Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	7	laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	8	Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	9	Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	10	God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	11	To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	12	I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	13	Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.	6	OEB
1 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with the kiss of love.	6	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	1	To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	2	We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	3	recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	4	Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	5	because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	6	And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	7	and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	8	For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	9	Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	1	10	and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	1	Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	2	For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	3	Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	4	But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	5	Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	6	Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	8	In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	9	You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	10	You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	11	Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	12	so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	13	This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	16	for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	17	As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	18	That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	19	For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	2	20	You are our pride and our delight!	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	1	And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	3	so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	4	For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	5	Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	6	But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	7	on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	8	For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	9	How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	11	May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	12	And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	3	13	and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	1	Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	4	each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	5	and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	6	none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God does not call us to an impure life, but demands holiness.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	9	As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	10	and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	11	Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	12	so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	13	We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	14	For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	15	This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	16	For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	17	Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterward we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	1	But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	2	You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	3	When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	4	You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	5	For you all are children of light and children of the day.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	7	It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	10	that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	12	We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord’s service, and give you counsel.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	13	Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	14	We entreat you also, friends – warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	15	Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	16	Always be joyful;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	17	never cease to pray;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	18	under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	19	Do not quench the Spirit;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	20	do not make light of preaching.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	21	Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	22	shun every form of evil.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	23	May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	24	He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	25	Friends, pray for us.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the Lord’s followers with a sacred kiss.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	27	I order you in the Lord’s name to have this letter read to all the brethren.	7	OEB
1 Thessalonians	5	28	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	7	OEB
1 Timothy	1	1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	3	I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	4	nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	5	The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	6	And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	8	We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	9	by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	10	for the immoral, for perverts, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	11	as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	12	I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	13	though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	14	and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	15	How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’! And there is no greater sinner than I!	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	16	Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterward to believe on him and attain eternal life.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	17	To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	18	This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	19	with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	1	20	Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	1	First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	2	especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	3	This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	4	whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	5	There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	7	and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	8	My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	9	I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	10	but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	11	They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	12	I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	13	Adam was formed first, not Eve.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	14	And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	2	15	But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	1	How true is this saying:‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	2	The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	3	not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	4	they should provide for their own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	5	If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	6	The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	7	They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	8	So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	9	but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	10	They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	11	It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	12	Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	13	Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	14	I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	15	but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	3	16	Yes, and undeniably wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for –	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	2	who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	3	and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	4	Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	5	for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	6	Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	7	As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	8	for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	9	How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	10	With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	11	Remember these things in your teaching.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	12	Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	15	Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	4	16	Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	1	Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	2	the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	3	Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	4	But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	5	As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	6	But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	7	Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	8	Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	9	A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	10	and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	11	But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	12	and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	13	And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	14	Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	15	There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	16	Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	17	Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	18	The words of scripture are –	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	19	Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	20	but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	21	I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	22	Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrongdoing of others. Keep your life pure.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	23	Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	24	There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	5	25	In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	1	All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	3	Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	4	is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarreling, recriminations, base suspicions,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	5	and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	6	Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment!	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	8	So, with food and shelter, we will be content.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	9	Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	10	Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	11	But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	12	Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	13	I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	14	I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	15	This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	16	who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honor and power for ever. Amen.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	17	Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	18	Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	19	storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	20	Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall ‘theology,’	8	OEB
1 Timothy	6	21	for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray.	8	OEB
Galatians	1	1	To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;	9	OEB
Galatians	1	2	and from all the followers of the Lord here.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	3	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,	9	OEB
Galatians	1	4	gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of our God and Father,	9	OEB
Galatians	1	5	to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	6	I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’	9	OEB
Galatians	1	7	which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	8	Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!	9	OEB
Galatians	1	9	We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!	9	OEB
Galatians	1	10	Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	11	I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	12	I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	13	You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and tried to destroy it,	9	OEB
Galatians	1	14	and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	15	But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,	9	OEB
Galatians	1	16	saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,	9	OEB
Galatians	1	17	or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	18	Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	19	I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	20	(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).	9	OEB
Galatians	1	21	Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.	9	OEB
Galatians	1	22	But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;	9	OEB
Galatians	1	23	all that they had heard was – ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once tried to destroy.’	9	OEB
Galatians	1	24	And they praised God for my sake.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	1	Fourteen years afterward I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	2	It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	3	Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	4	But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –	9	OEB
Galatians	2	5	Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!	9	OEB
Galatians	2	6	Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	7	On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	8	For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	9	Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	10	Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	11	But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	12	Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	14	But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”	9	OEB
Galatians	2	15	We, though we are Jews by birth and not sinners of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	16	So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	17	If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be sinners, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!	9	OEB
Galatians	2	18	For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	19	I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.	9	OEB
Galatians	2	21	I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die!	9	OEB
Galatians	3	1	Foolish Galatians! Who has been enchanting you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?	9	OEB
Galatians	3	2	Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?	9	OEB
Galatians	3	3	Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?	9	OEB
Galatians	3	4	Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose!	9	OEB
Galatians	3	5	He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?	9	OEB
Galatians	3	6	It is just as it was with Abraham –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	7	You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	8	And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	9	And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	10	All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	11	Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	12	But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	13	Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says –	9	OEB
Galatians	3	14	And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	15	To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	16	Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	17	My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	18	If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	19	What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrongdoings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	20	Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	21	Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	22	But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	23	Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	24	Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	26	For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	28	All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.	9	OEB
Galatians	3	29	And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	1	My point is this – as long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	2	He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	3	And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;	9	OEB
Galatians	4	4	but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –	9	OEB
Galatians	4	5	to ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	6	And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – ‘Abba, our Father.’	9	OEB
Galatians	4	7	You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	8	Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	9	But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?	9	OEB
Galatians	4	10	You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years!	9	OEB
Galatians	4	11	You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	12	I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	13	You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	14	And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself!	9	OEB
Galatians	4	15	What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!	9	OEB
Galatians	4	16	Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?	9	OEB
Galatians	4	17	Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	18	It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –	9	OEB
Galatians	4	19	you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	20	But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?	9	OEB
Galatians	4	22	Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	23	But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	24	This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	25	Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and represents the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	27	For scripture says –	9	OEB
Galatians	4	28	As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	29	Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.	9	OEB
Galatians	4	30	But what does the passage of scripture say?	9	OEB
Galatians	4	31	And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	1	It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	2	Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	3	I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	4	You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	5	For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	6	If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	7	You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?	9	OEB
Galatians	5	8	The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	9	A little yeast leavens all the dough.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	10	I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	11	If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle!	9	OEB
Galatians	5	12	I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	13	Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only, do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence but serve one another in a loving spirit.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	14	Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept –	9	OEB
Galatians	5	15	But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	16	This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	17	For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	18	But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	19	The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,	9	OEB
Galatians	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,	9	OEB
Galatians	5	21	feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	22	But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	23	Against such things there is no law!	9	OEB
Galatians	5	24	And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	25	Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.	9	OEB
Galatians	5	26	Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	1	My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	2	Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	3	If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	4	Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;	9	OEB
Galatians	6	5	for everyone must bear their own load.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	6	The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	8	For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	9	Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	10	Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the household of the faith.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	11	See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	12	The people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are the people who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances. They do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ	9	OEB
Galatians	6	13	Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	14	But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	16	May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	17	For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.	9	OEB
Galatians	6	18	May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.	9	OEB
Hebrews	1	1	God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	2	has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	3	For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he took his seat at the right hand of God’s Majesty on high,	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	4	having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	6	And again, when God brought the firstborn into the world, he said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	7	Speaking of the angels, he said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	8	while of the Son he said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	9	You love righteousness and hates iniquity;	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	10	Again –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	11	They will perish, but you remain;	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	12	As a mantle you will fold them up,	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	13	To which of the angels has God ever said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	1	14	Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	2	For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	3	how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	4	while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	5	God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	6	No; a writer has declared somewhere –	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	7	You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	8	you have placed all things beneath their feet.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	9	What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	10	It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	11	For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	12	He says –	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	13	And again –	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	14	Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	15	and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	16	It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	17	And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.	10	OEB
Hebrews	2	18	The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	2	See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	3	He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	4	For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	5	While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	6	the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says –	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	8	harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	9	Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	11	While in my wrath I swore –	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	12	Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	13	Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	14	For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	15	To use the words of scripture –	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	16	Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	18	And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?	10	OEB
Hebrews	3	19	We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	1	We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	2	For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	3	Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	4	for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words –	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	5	On the other hand, we read in that passage –	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	6	Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	7	again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted –	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	8	Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	9	There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	10	For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	11	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	12	God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	13	There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	14	We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	15	Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.	10	OEB
Hebrews	4	16	Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	1	Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	2	And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	3	and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	4	Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	5	In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him –	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	6	and on another occasion also –	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	7	Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	8	Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	9	and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	10	while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	11	Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	12	For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.	10	OEB
Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	1	Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	2	teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	3	Yes and, with God’s help, we will.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	4	For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	5	and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	6	if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	7	Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	8	but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	9	But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	11	But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	12	Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	13	When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	14	His words were –	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	15	And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	16	People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	17	And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	18	For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	19	This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,	10	OEB
Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	1	It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	2	and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	3	There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	4	Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	5	Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	6	But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	7	Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	8	In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	9	Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	10	for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	11	If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	12	With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	13	And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	14	For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	15	All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	16	and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	17	for that is the meaning of the declaration –	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	18	On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	19	(for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	20	Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	21	but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him –	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	22	And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	23	Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	24	but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	25	And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	26	This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	27	one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.	10	OEB
Hebrews	7	28	The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	1	To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	2	where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	4	If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	5	(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	6	But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	7	If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	8	But, finding fault with the people, God says –	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	9	Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	10	“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	11	There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their wrongdoings,	10	OEB
Hebrews	8	13	By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	1	It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	2	For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	3	The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	4	In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	5	while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	6	Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	7	but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	8	By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	9	For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	10	the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	11	But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	12	Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	13	For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	15	And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	16	Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	17	For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	18	This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	19	For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	20	saying, as he did so – “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	22	Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	23	While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	24	For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	26	for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	27	And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),	10	OEB
Hebrews	9	28	so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	1	The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	3	But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	4	For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	5	That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared –	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	6	You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	7	So I said, “See, I have come” (as is written of me in the pages of the book),	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	8	First come the words – ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the Law),	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	9	and then there is added – ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	10	And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	11	Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	12	But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	13	and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	14	By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	15	We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying –	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	16	‘“This is the covenant that I will make with them	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	17	then we have –	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	18	And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	19	Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he inaugurated for us – a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	21	and, since we have in him ‘a great priest set over the house of God,’	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	23	Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	24	Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	25	And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	26	Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	27	there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	28	When someone disregarded the Law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	29	How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	30	We know who it was that said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	32	Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	34	For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	35	Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	36	You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	37	‘For there is indeed but a very little while	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	38	and through faith the righteous will find life,	10	OEB
Hebrews	10	39	But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	1	Faith is the realization of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	2	And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	3	Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	4	Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	5	Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	6	but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	7	It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	8	It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterward to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	9	It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	11	Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for childbearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	12	And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous ‘as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	13	All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only foreigners and strangers on the earth.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	14	Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	16	But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	17	It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	18	of whom it had been said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	19	For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	20	It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	21	Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and ‘to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	22	Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	23	Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	24	It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of ‘son of a daughter of Pharaoh.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	25	He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	26	For he counted ‘the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ’ of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	27	Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	28	Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	29	Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	30	Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	31	Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	32	Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	33	By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	34	quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	36	Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	38	people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	39	Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfillment of God’s promise;	10	OEB
Hebrews	11	40	since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	1	Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	2	our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	3	Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children –	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	6	For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	7	It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	8	If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	9	Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	10	Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	11	No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	12	Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	13	make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	14	Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	15	Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	16	Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	18	It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	19	and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	20	for they could not bear to think of the command – ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – ‘I tremble with fear.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	22	No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	23	to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	25	Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	26	Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is –	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	27	And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.	10	OEB
Hebrews	12	29	For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	1	Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	2	Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	3	Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	5	Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said –	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	6	Therefore we may say with confidence –	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	7	Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever!	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	9	Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	10	We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	11	The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	12	And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	13	Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	14	for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	15	Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	16	Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	19	And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	20	May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord –	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	21	may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	22	I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	23	You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	24	Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.	10	OEB
Hebrews	13	25	May God bless you all.	10	OEB
James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad.	11	OEB
James	1	2	My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,	11	OEB
James	1	3	knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.	11	OEB
James	1	4	And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.	11	OEB
James	1	5	If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.	11	OEB
James	1	6	But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –	11	OEB
James	1	7	Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,	11	OEB
James	1	8	vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.	11	OEB
James	1	9	Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,	11	OEB
James	1	10	but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.	11	OEB
James	1	11	As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.	11	OEB
James	1	12	Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.	11	OEB
James	1	13	Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.	11	OEB
James	1	14	A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.	11	OEB
James	1	15	Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.	11	OEB
James	1	16	Do not be deceived, my dear friends.	11	OEB
James	1	17	Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.	11	OEB
James	1	18	Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation.	11	OEB
James	1	19	Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;	11	OEB
James	1	20	for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.	11	OEB
James	1	21	Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.	11	OEB
James	1	22	Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.	11	OEB
James	1	23	For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.	11	OEB
James	1	24	They look at themselves, then go on their way,	11	OEB
James	1	25	but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.	11	OEB
James	1	26	When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.	11	OEB
James	1	27	That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.	11	OEB
James	2	1	My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?	11	OEB
James	2	2	Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,	11	OEB
James	2	3	and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”	11	OEB
James	2	4	Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?	11	OEB
James	2	5	Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?	11	OEB
James	2	6	But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?	11	OEB
James	2	7	Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?	11	OEB
James	2	8	If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;	11	OEB
James	2	9	but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.	11	OEB
James	2	10	For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.	11	OEB
James	2	11	He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.	11	OEB
James	2	12	Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’	11	OEB
James	2	13	For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.	11	OEB
James	2	14	My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?	11	OEB
James	2	15	Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,	11	OEB
James	2	16	and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?	11	OEB
James	2	17	In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.	11	OEB
James	2	18	Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.”	11	OEB
James	2	19	It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.	11	OEB
James	2	20	Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?	11	OEB
James	2	21	Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?	11	OEB
James	2	22	You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;	11	OEB
James	2	23	and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”	11	OEB
James	2	24	You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.	11	OEB
James	2	25	Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?	11	OEB
James	2	26	Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.	11	OEB
James	3	1	Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.	11	OEB
James	3	2	We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.	11	OEB
James	3	3	When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.	11	OEB
James	3	4	Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.	11	OEB
James	3	5	So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!	11	OEB
James	3	6	And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.	11	OEB
James	3	7	For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,	11	OEB
James	3	8	no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!	11	OEB
James	3	9	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’	11	OEB
James	3	10	From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.	11	OEB
James	3	11	Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?	11	OEB
James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.	11	OEB
James	3	13	Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.	11	OEB
James	3	14	But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.	11	OEB
James	3	15	That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.	11	OEB
James	3	16	For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.	11	OEB
James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.	11	OEB
James	3	18	Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace.	11	OEB
James	4	1	What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?	11	OEB
James	4	2	You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.	11	OEB
James	4	3	You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.	11	OEB
James	4	4	Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.	11	OEB
James	4	5	Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’	11	OEB
James	4	6	But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, –	11	OEB
James	4	7	Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.	11	OEB
James	4	8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!	11	OEB
James	4	9	Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!	11	OEB
James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.	11	OEB
James	4	11	Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.	11	OEB
James	4	12	There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor?	11	OEB
James	4	13	Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’	11	OEB
James	4	14	yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.	11	OEB
James	4	15	Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’	11	OEB
James	4	16	But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.	11	OEB
James	4	17	The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them.	11	OEB
James	5	1	Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!	11	OEB
James	5	2	Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.	11	OEB
James	5	3	Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.	11	OEB
James	5	4	Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!	11	OEB
James	5	5	You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.	11	OEB
James	5	6	You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?	11	OEB
James	5	7	Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.	11	OEB
James	5	8	And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.	11	OEB
James	5	9	Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!	11	OEB
James	5	10	Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.	11	OEB
James	5	11	We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’	11	OEB
James	5	12	Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.	11	OEB
James	5	13	If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.	11	OEB
James	5	14	If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.	11	OEB
James	5	15	The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.	11	OEB
James	5	16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.	11	OEB
James	5	17	Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.	11	OEB
James	5	18	And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.	11	OEB
James	5	19	My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,	11	OEB
James	5	20	be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.	11	OEB
John	1	1	In the beginning the Word was;	12	OEB
John	1	2	He was in the beginning with God;	12	OEB
John	1	3	through him all things came into being,	12	OEB
John	1	4	That which came into being in him was life;	12	OEB
John	1	5	and the light shines in the darkness,	12	OEB
John	1	6	There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;	12	OEB
John	1	7	he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light	12	OEB
John	1	8	He was not the light,	12	OEB
John	1	9	That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.	12	OEB
John	1	10	He was in the world;	12	OEB
John	1	11	He came to his own –	12	OEB
John	1	12	But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God –	12	OEB
John	1	13	For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life,	12	OEB
John	1	14	And the Word became human, and lived among us,	12	OEB
John	1	15	(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke –	12	OEB
John	1	16	out of his fullness we have all received	12	OEB
John	1	17	for the Law was given through Moses,	12	OEB
John	1	18	No one has ever yet seen God;	12	OEB
John	1	19	When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”,	12	OEB
John	1	20	he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.”	12	OEB
John	1	21	“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”	12	OEB
John	1	22	“Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”	12	OEB
John	1	23	“I,” he answered, “am –	12	OEB
John	1	24	These men had been sent from the Pharisees;	12	OEB
John	1	25	and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”	12	OEB
John	1	26	John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;	12	OEB
John	1	27	he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”	12	OEB
John	1	28	This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.	12	OEB
John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!	12	OEB
John	1	30	I was talking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’	12	OEB
John	1	31	I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”	12	OEB
John	1	32	John also said:	12	OEB
John	1	33	I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’	12	OEB
John	1	34	This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”	12	OEB
John	1	35	The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,	12	OEB
John	1	36	he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!”	12	OEB
John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.	12	OEB
John	1	38	But Jesus turned around, and saw them following.  “What are you looking for?”  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?”	12	OEB
John	1	39	“Come, and you will see,”  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him.	12	OEB
John	1	40	One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.	12	OEB
John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)	12	OEB
John	1	42	Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said,  “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).	12	OEB
John	1	43	The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him,  “Follow me.”	12	OEB
John	1	44	Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.	12	OEB
John	1	45	He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”	12	OEB
John	1	46	“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.	12	OEB
John	1	47	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said,  “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”	12	OEB
John	1	48	“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael.  “Even before Philip called you,”  replied Jesus,  “when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”	12	OEB
John	1	49	“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”	12	OEB
John	1	50	“Do you believe in me,”  asked Jesus,  “because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!	12	OEB
John	1	51	In truth I tell you,”  he added,  “you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”	12	OEB
John	2	1	Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.	12	OEB
John	2	2	Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.	12	OEB
John	2	3	And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”	12	OEB
John	2	4	“What do you want with me?”  answered Jesus.  “My time has not come yet.”	12	OEB
John	2	5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”	12	OEB
John	2	6	There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.	12	OEB
John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants,  “Fill the water-jars with water.”	12	OEB
John	2	8	And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added,  “Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”  The servants did so.	12	OEB
John	2	9	And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –	12	OEB
John	2	10	He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”	12	OEB
John	2	11	This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.	12	OEB
John	2	12	After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.	12	OEB
John	2	13	Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	12	OEB
John	2	14	In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.	12	OEB
John	2	15	So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,	12	OEB
John	2	16	and said to the pigeon-dealers,  “Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.”	12	OEB
John	2	17	His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’	12	OEB
John	2	18	Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”	12	OEB
John	2	19	“Destroy this temple,”  was his answer,  “and I will raise it in three days.”	12	OEB
John	2	20	“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”	12	OEB
John	2	21	But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.	12	OEB
John	2	22	Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.	12	OEB
John	2	23	While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.	12	OEB
John	2	24	But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.	12	OEB
John	2	25	He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.	12	OEB
John	3	1	Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.	12	OEB
John	3	2	This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”	12	OEB
John	3	3	“In truth I tell you,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.”	12	OEB
John	3	4	“How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”	12	OEB
John	3	5	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.	12	OEB
John	3	6	All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual.	12	OEB
John	3	7	Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn.	12	OEB
John	3	8	The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.”	12	OEB
John	3	9	“How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.	12	OEB
John	3	10	“What! You a teacher of Israel,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “and yet do not understand this!	12	OEB
John	3	11	In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements.	12	OEB
John	3	12	If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things?	12	OEB
John	3	13	No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven – the Son of Man himself.	12	OEB
John	3	14	And, as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;	12	OEB
John	3	15	so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”	12	OEB
John	3	16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.	12	OEB
John	3	17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.	12	OEB
John	3	18	The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God.	12	OEB
John	3	19	The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked.	12	OEB
John	3	20	For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed;	12	OEB
John	3	21	but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do.	12	OEB
John	3	22	After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.	12	OEB
John	3	23	John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.	12	OEB
John	3	24	(For John had not yet been imprisoned).	12	OEB
John	3	25	Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification;	12	OEB
John	3	26	and the disciples came to John and said, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”	12	OEB
John	3	27	John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.	12	OEB
John	3	28	You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’	12	OEB
John	3	29	It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.	12	OEB
John	3	30	He must become greater, and I less.”	12	OEB
John	3	31	He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.	12	OEB
John	3	32	He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.	12	OEB
John	3	33	They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.	12	OEB
John	3	34	For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.	12	OEB
John	3	35	The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.	12	OEB
John	3	36	The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure.	12	OEB
John	4	1	Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John	12	OEB
John	4	2	(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),	12	OEB
John	4	3	he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.	12	OEB
John	4	4	He had to pass through Samaria,	12	OEB
John	4	5	and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.	12	OEB
John	4	6	Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.	12	OEB
John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her –  “Give me some to drink,”	12	OEB
John	4	8	For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.	12	OEB
John	4	9	“How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).	12	OEB
John	4	10	“If you knew of the gift of God,”  replied Jesus,  “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”	12	OEB
John	4	11	“You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said. “Where did you get that ‘living water?’	12	OEB
John	4	12	Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!”	12	OEB
John	4	13	“All who drink of this water,”  replied Jesus,  “will be thirsty again;	12	OEB
John	4	14	but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.”	12	OEB
John	4	15	“Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.”	12	OEB
John	4	16	“Go and call your husband,”  said Jesus,  “and then come back.”	12	OEB
John	4	17	“I have no husband,” answered the woman.  “You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’”  replied Jesus,	12	OEB
John	4	18	“For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.”	12	OEB
John	4	19	“I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.	12	OEB
John	4	20	“It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.”	12	OEB
John	4	21	“Believe me,”  replied Jesus,  “a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.	12	OEB
John	4	22	You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.	12	OEB
John	4	23	But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.	12	OEB
John	4	24	God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.”	12	OEB
John	4	25	“I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.”	12	OEB
John	4	26	“I am he,”  Jesus said to her,  “I who am speaking to you.”	12	OEB
John	4	27	At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’	12	OEB
John	4	28	So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,	12	OEB
John	4	29	“Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”	12	OEB
John	4	30	And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.	12	OEB
John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.”	12	OEB
John	4	32	“I have food to eat,”  he answered,  “of which you know nothing.”	12	OEB
John	4	33	“Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.	12	OEB
John	4	34	“My food,”  replied Jesus,  “is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.	12	OEB
John	4	35	Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!	12	OEB
John	4	36	Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.	12	OEB
John	4	37	For here the proverb holds good – ‘One sows, another reaps.’	12	OEB
John	4	38	I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.”	12	OEB
John	4	39	Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’	12	OEB
John	4	40	And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.	12	OEB
John	4	41	But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,	12	OEB
John	4	42	and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.”	12	OEB
John	4	43	After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;	12	OEB
John	4	44	for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’	12	OEB
John	4	45	When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.	12	OEB
John	4	46	So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.	12	OEB
John	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.	12	OEB
John	4	48	Jesus answered,  “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”	12	OEB
John	4	49	“Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.”	12	OEB
John	4	50	The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;	12	OEB
John	4	51	and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.	12	OEB
John	4	52	So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”	12	OEB
John	4	53	By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him  ‘Your son is living’ ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.	12	OEB
John	4	54	This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.	12	OEB
John	5	1	Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	12	OEB
John	5	2	There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades around it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’	12	OEB
John	5	3	In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled.	12	OEB
John	5	4	^[ 5:4 Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had.]	12	OEB
John	5	5	One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years.	12	OEB
John	5	6	Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him,  “Do you wish to be cured?”	12	OEB
John	5	7	“I have no one, Sir,” the sick man answered, “to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.”	12	OEB
John	5	8	“Stand up,”  said Jesus,  “take up your mat, and walk.”	12	OEB
John	5	9	The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking.	12	OEB
John	5	10	Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.”	12	OEB
John	5	11	“The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me  ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”	12	OEB
John	5	12	“Who was it,” they asked, “that said to you  ‘Take up your mat and walk’?”	12	OEB
John	5	13	But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.	12	OEB
John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him,  “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.”	12	OEB
John	5	15	The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.	12	OEB
John	5	16	And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.	12	OEB
John	5	17	But Jesus replied,  “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.”	12	OEB
John	5	18	This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God.	12	OEB
John	5	19	So Jesus made this further reply,  “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also.	12	OEB
John	5	20	For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder.	12	OEB
John	5	21	For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases.	12	OEB
John	5	22	The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son,	12	OEB
John	5	23	so that everyone may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him.	12	OEB
John	5	24	In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life.	12	OEB
John	5	25	In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live.	12	OEB
John	5	26	For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him;	12	OEB
John	5	27	and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge.	12	OEB
John	5	28	Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice,	12	OEB
John	5	29	and will come out – those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation.	12	OEB
John	5	30	I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.	12	OEB
John	5	31	“If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy;	12	OEB
John	5	32	it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy.	12	OEB
John	5	33	You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.	12	OEB
John	5	34	But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation.	12	OEB
John	5	35	He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light.	12	OEB
John	5	36	But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John’s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out – the work that I am doing – is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger.	12	OEB
John	5	37	The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form;	12	OEB
John	5	38	and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger.	12	OEB
John	5	39	You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life;  and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me,	12	OEB
John	5	40	you refuse to come to me to have life.	12	OEB
John	5	41	“I do not receive honor from people,	12	OEB
John	5	42	but I know this of you, that you have not the love of God in your hearts.	12	OEB
John	5	43	I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.	12	OEB
John	5	44	How can you believe in me, when you receive honor from one another and do not desire the honor which comes from the only God?	12	OEB
John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes.	12	OEB
John	5	46	For, had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote;	12	OEB
John	5	47	but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my teaching?”	12	OEB
John	6	1	After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.	12	OEB
John	6	2	A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.	12	OEB
John	6	3	Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.	12	OEB
John	6	4	It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.	12	OEB
John	6	5	Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,  “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?”	12	OEB
John	6	6	He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.	12	OEB
John	6	7	“Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,” answered Philip, “it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.”	12	OEB
John	6	8	“There is a boy here,” said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother,	12	OEB
John	6	9	“Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?”	12	OEB
John	6	10	“Make the people sit down,”  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,	12	OEB
John	6	11	and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.	12	OEB
John	6	12	When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,  “Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.”	12	OEB
John	6	13	The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.	12	OEB
John	6	14	When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, “This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.”	12	OEB
John	6	15	But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone.	12	OEB
John	6	16	When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,	12	OEB
John	6	17	and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;	12	OEB
John	6	18	the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.	12	OEB
John	6	19	When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.	12	OEB
John	6	20	But Jesus said to them,  “It is I; do not be afraid!”	12	OEB
John	6	21	And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.	12	OEB
John	6	22	The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.	12	OEB
John	6	23	Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.	12	OEB
John	6	24	So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.	12	OEB
John	6	25	And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?”	12	OEB
John	6	26	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied.	12	OEB
John	6	27	Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.”	12	OEB
John	6	28	“How,” they asked, “are we to do the work that God wants us to do?”	12	OEB
John	6	29	“The work that God wants you to do,”  answered Jesus,  “is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.”	12	OEB
John	6	30	“What sign, then,” they asked, “are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?	12	OEB
John	6	31	Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”	12	OEB
John	6	32	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven;	12	OEB
John	6	33	for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.”	12	OEB
John	6	34	“Master,” they exclaimed, “give us that bread always!”	12	OEB
John	6	35	“I am the life-giving bread,”  Jesus said to them,  “whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst again.	12	OEB
John	6	36	But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me.	12	OEB
John	6	37	All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away.	12	OEB
John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me;	12	OEB
John	6	39	and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day.	12	OEB
John	6	40	For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.”	12	OEB
John	6	41	The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying –  ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven.’	12	OEB
John	6	42	“Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,” they asked, “whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?”	12	OEB
John	6	43	“Do not murmur among yourselves,”  said Jesus in reply.	12	OEB
John	6	44	“No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day.	12	OEB
John	6	45	It is said in the prophets – ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me.	12	OEB
John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father.	12	OEB
John	6	47	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life.	12	OEB
John	6	48	I am the life-giving bread.	12	OEB
John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died.	12	OEB
John	6	50	The bread that comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die.	12	OEB
John	6	51	I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”	12	OEB
John	6	52	They began disputing with one another, “How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?”	12	OEB
John	6	53	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you.	12	OEB
John	6	54	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day.	12	OEB
John	6	55	For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink.	12	OEB
John	6	56	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them.	12	OEB
John	6	57	As the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live because I live.	12	OEB
John	6	58	That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.”	12	OEB
John	6	59	All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.	12	OEB
John	6	60	On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?”	12	OEB
John	6	61	But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them,	12	OEB
John	6	62	“Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?	12	OEB
John	6	63	It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life.	12	OEB
John	6	64	Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.”  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;	12	OEB
John	6	65	and he added,  “This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.”	12	OEB
John	6	66	After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.	12	OEB
John	6	67	So Jesus said to the Twelve,  “Do you also wish to leave me?”	12	OEB
John	6	68	But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;	12	OEB
John	6	69	and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”	12	OEB
John	6	70	“Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?”  replied Jesus,  “and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.”	12	OEB
John	6	71	He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.	12	OEB
John	7	1	After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.	12	OEB
John	7	2	When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,	12	OEB
John	7	3	his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.	12	OEB
John	7	4	For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”	12	OEB
John	7	5	For even his brothers did not believe in him.	12	OEB
John	7	6	“My time,”  answered Jesus,  “is not come yet, but your time is always here.	12	OEB
John	7	7	The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.	12	OEB
John	7	8	Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.”	12	OEB
John	7	9	After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.	12	OEB
John	7	10	But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.	12	OEB
John	7	11	The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;	12	OEB
John	7	12	and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’	12	OEB
John	7	13	No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities.	12	OEB
John	7	14	About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.	12	OEB
John	7	15	The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”	12	OEB
John	7	16	So, in reply, Jesus said,  “My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.	12	OEB
John	7	17	If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.	12	OEB
John	7	18	The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.	12	OEB
John	7	19	Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?”	12	OEB
John	7	20	“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”	12	OEB
John	7	21	“There was one thing I did,”  replied Jesus,  “at which you are all still wondering.	12	OEB
John	7	22	But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.	12	OEB
John	7	23	When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?	12	OEB
John	7	24	Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.”	12	OEB
John	7	25	At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?	12	OEB
John	7	26	Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?	12	OEB
John	7	27	Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”	12	OEB
John	7	28	Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said,  “Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.	12	OEB
John	7	29	I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.”	12	OEB
John	7	30	So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.	12	OEB
John	7	31	Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”	12	OEB
John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;	12	OEB
John	7	33	at which Jesus said,  “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.	12	OEB
John	7	34	You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.”	12	OEB
John	7	35	“Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?	12	OEB
John	7	36	What does he mean by saying  ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”	12	OEB
John	7	37	On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed,  “If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me and drink.	12	OEB
John	7	38	From the heart of those who believe in me will flow, as is said in scripture, rivers of living water.”	12	OEB
John	7	39	(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)	12	OEB
John	7	40	Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;	12	OEB
John	7	41	others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?	12	OEB
John	7	42	Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”	12	OEB
John	7	43	So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.	12	OEB
John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.	12	OEB
John	7	45	When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?”	12	OEB
John	7	46	“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.	12	OEB
John	7	47	“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.	12	OEB
John	7	48	“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?	12	OEB
John	7	49	As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”	12	OEB
John	7	50	But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,	12	OEB
John	7	51	“Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?”	12	OEB
John	7	52	“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”	12	OEB
John	7	53	And everyone went home	12	OEB
John	8	1	except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives^[ 8:1 This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.].	12	OEB
John	8	2	But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.	12	OEB
John	8	3	Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,	12	OEB
John	8	4	and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.	12	OEB
John	8	5	Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?”	12	OEB
John	8	6	They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.	12	OEB
John	8	7	However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.”	12	OEB
John	8	8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.	12	OEB
John	8	9	When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.	12	OEB
John	8	10	Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”	12	OEB
John	8	11	“No one, Sir,” she answered.	12	OEB
John	8	12	Jesus again addressed the people.  “I am the light of the world,”  he said.  “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”	12	OEB
John	8	13	“You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.”	12	OEB
John	8	14	“Even if I bear testimony to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.	12	OEB
John	8	15	You judge by appearances; I judge no one.	12	OEB
John	8	16	Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.	12	OEB
John	8	17	Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.	12	OEB
John	8	18	I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.”	12	OEB
John	8	19	“Where is your father, then?”  they asked.  “You know neither me nor my Father,”  replied Jesus.  “If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.”	12	OEB
John	8	20	These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.	12	OEB
John	8	21	Jesus again spoke to the people.  “I am going away,”  he said,  “and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.”	12	OEB
John	8	22	“Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says –  ‘You cannot go where I am going’?”	12	OEB
John	8	23	“You,”  added Jesus,  “are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;	12	OEB
John	8	24	and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.”	12	OEB
John	8	25	“Who are you?” they asked.  “Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”  said Jesus.	12	OEB
John	8	26	“I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.”	12	OEB
John	8	27	They did not understand that he meant the Father.	12	OEB
John	8	28	So Jesus added,  “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.	12	OEB
John	8	29	Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.”	12	OEB
John	8	30	While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.	12	OEB
John	8	31	So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him,  “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;	12	OEB
John	8	32	and you will find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.”	12	OEB
John	8	33	“We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying  ‘you will be set free’?”	12	OEB
John	8	34	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “everyone who sins is a slave to sin.	12	OEB
John	8	35	And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.	12	OEB
John	8	36	If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!	12	OEB
John	8	37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts.	12	OEB
John	8	38	I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”	12	OEB
John	8	39	“Our father is Abraham,” was their answer.  “If you are Abraham’s children,”  replied Jesus,  “do what Abraham did.	12	OEB
John	8	40	But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.	12	OEB
John	8	41	You are doing what your own father does.”	12	OEB
John	8	42	“If God were your Father,”  Jesus replied,  “you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger.	12	OEB
John	8	43	How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.	12	OEB
John	8	44	As for you, you are children of your father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.	12	OEB
John	8	45	But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.	12	OEB
John	8	46	Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth?	12	OEB
John	8	47	The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.”	12	OEB
John	8	48	“Aren’t we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?”	12	OEB
John	8	49	“I am not possessed by a demon,”  Jesus answered,  “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me.	12	OEB
John	8	50	Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides.	12	OEB
John	8	51	In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.”	12	OEB
John	8	52	“Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say  ‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’	12	OEB
John	8	53	Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?”	12	OEB
John	8	54	“If I do honor to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor – and you say that he is your God;	12	OEB
John	8	55	and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart.	12	OEB
John	8	56	Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.”	12	OEB
John	8	57	“You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?”	12	OEB
John	8	58	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “before Abraham existed I was.”	12	OEB
John	8	59	At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.	12	OEB
John	9	1	As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.	12	OEB
John	9	2	“Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”	12	OEB
John	9	3	“Neither the man nor the parents,”  replied Jesus,  “but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him.	12	OEB
John	9	4	We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.	12	OEB
John	9	5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”	12	OEB
John	9	6	Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.	12	OEB
John	9	7	“Go,”  he said,  “and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam”  (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.	12	OEB
John	9	8	His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?”	12	OEB
John	9	9	“Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.”	12	OEB
John	9	10	“How did you get your sight, then?” they asked.	12	OEB
John	9	11	“The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said to me  ‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.”	12	OEB
John	9	12	“Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.	12	OEB
John	9	13	They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.	12	OEB
John	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight.	12	OEB
John	9	15	So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put a paste on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.”	12	OEB
John	9	16	“The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.”	12	OEB
John	9	17	So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?”	12	OEB
John	9	18	The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.	12	OEB
John	9	19	“Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?”	12	OEB
John	9	20	“We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind;	12	OEB
John	9	21	but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.”	12	OEB
John	9	22	His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.	12	OEB
John	9	23	This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’	12	OEB
John	9	24	So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.”	12	OEB
John	9	25	“I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.”	12	OEB
John	9	26	“What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?”	12	OEB
John	9	27	“I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?”	12	OEB
John	9	28	“You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses.	12	OEB
John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”	12	OEB
John	9	30	“Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight!	12	OEB
John	9	31	We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.	12	OEB
John	9	32	Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.	12	OEB
John	9	33	If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.”	12	OEB
John	9	34	“You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him.	12	OEB
John	9	35	Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked,  “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”	12	OEB
John	9	36	“Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.”	12	OEB
John	9	37	“Not only have you seen him,”  said Jesus,  “but it is he who is now speaking to you.”	12	OEB
John	9	38	“Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him;	12	OEB
John	9	39	and Jesus added,  “It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.”	12	OEB
John	9	40	Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?”	12	OEB
John	9	41	“If you had been blind,”  replied Jesus,  “you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains.	12	OEB
John	10	1	In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;	12	OEB
John	10	2	but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep.	12	OEB
John	10	3	For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.	12	OEB
John	10	4	When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.	12	OEB
John	10	5	They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.”	12	OEB
John	10	6	This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.	12	OEB
John	10	7	So he continued,  “In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep.	12	OEB
John	10	8	All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them.	12	OEB
John	10	9	I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.	12	OEB
John	10	10	The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.	12	OEB
John	10	11	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.	12	OEB
John	10	12	The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.	12	OEB
John	10	13	He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep.	12	OEB
John	10	14	I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me –	12	OEB
John	10	15	Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep.	12	OEB
John	10	16	I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd.	12	OEB
John	10	17	This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again.	12	OEB
John	10	18	No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.”	12	OEB
John	10	19	In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.	12	OEB
John	10	20	Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?”	12	OEB
John	10	21	Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?”	12	OEB
John	10	22	Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.	12	OEB
John	10	23	It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,	12	OEB
John	10	24	when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.”	12	OEB
John	10	25	“I have told you so,”  replied Jesus,  “and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me.	12	OEB
John	10	26	But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock.	12	OEB
John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me;	12	OEB
John	10	28	and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.	12	OEB
John	10	29	What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands.	12	OEB
John	10	30	The Father and I are one.”	12	OEB
John	10	31	Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;	12	OEB
John	10	32	and seeing this, Jesus said,  “I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?”	12	OEB
John	10	33	“It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.”	12	OEB
John	10	34	“Are there not,”  replied Jesus,  “these words in your Law – ‘I said, You are gods’?	12	OEB
John	10	35	If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ – and scripture cannot be set aside –	12	OEB
John	10	36	do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’?	12	OEB
John	10	37	If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me;	12	OEB
John	10	38	if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.”	12	OEB
John	10	39	The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.	12	OEB
John	10	40	Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.	12	OEB
John	10	41	“John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.”	12	OEB
John	10	42	And many learned to believe in Jesus there.	12	OEB
John	11	1	Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.	12	OEB
John	11	2	This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.	12	OEB
John	11	3	The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’;	12	OEB
John	11	4	and, when Jesus heard it, he said,  “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.”	12	OEB
John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.	12	OEB
John	11	6	Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.	12	OEB
John	11	7	Then, after that, he said to his disciples,  “Let us go to Judea again.”	12	OEB
John	11	8	“Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?”	12	OEB
John	11	9	“Are not there twelve hours in the day?”  answered Jesus.  “If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun;	12	OEB
John	11	10	but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.”	12	OEB
John	11	11	And, when he had said this, he added,  “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.”	12	OEB
John	11	12	“If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples.	12	OEB
John	11	13	But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.	12	OEB
John	11	14	Then he said to them plainly,  “Lazarus is dead;	12	OEB
John	11	15	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.”	12	OEB
John	11	16	At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”	12	OEB
John	11	17	When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.	12	OEB
John	11	18	Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,	12	OEB
John	11	19	a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother’s death.	12	OEB
John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.	12	OEB
John	11	21	“Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.	12	OEB
John	11	22	Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.”	12	OEB
John	11	23	“Your brother will rise to life,”  said Jesus.	12	OEB
John	11	24	“I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.”	12	OEB
John	11	25	“I am the resurrection and the life,”  said Jesus.  “He who believes in me will live, though he die;	12	OEB
John	11	26	and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”	12	OEB
John	11	27	“Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”	12	OEB
John	11	28	After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.”	12	OEB
John	11	29	As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.	12	OEB
John	11	30	Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.	12	OEB
John	11	31	So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.	12	OEB
John	11	32	When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!”	12	OEB
John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.	12	OEB
John	11	34	“Where have you buried him?”  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered.	12	OEB
John	11	35	Jesus burst into tears.	12	OEB
John	11	36	“How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed;	12	OEB
John	11	37	but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?”	12	OEB
John	11	38	Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.	12	OEB
John	11	39	“Move the stone away,”  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.”	12	OEB
John	11	40	“Didn’t I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?”	12	OEB
John	11	41	So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said,  “Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer;	12	OEB
John	11	42	I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.”	12	OEB
John	11	43	Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice,  “Lazarus! Come out!”	12	OEB
John	11	44	The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth.  “Set him free,”  said Jesus,  “and let him go.”	12	OEB
John	11	45	In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.	12	OEB
John	11	46	Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.	12	OEB
John	11	47	The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?	12	OEB
John	11	48	If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and our nation.”	12	OEB
John	11	49	One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,	12	OEB
John	11	50	“You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”	12	OEB
John	11	51	Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –	12	OEB
John	11	52	And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.	12	OEB
John	11	53	So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.	12	OEB
John	11	54	In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.	12	OEB
John	11	55	But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.	12	OEB
John	11	56	So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”	12	OEB
John	11	57	The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.	12	OEB
John	12	1	Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.	12	OEB
John	12	2	There a supper was given in his honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.	12	OEB
John	12	3	So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.	12	OEB
John	12	4	One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,	12	OEB
John	12	5	“Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?”	12	OEB
John	12	6	He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.	12	OEB
John	12	7	“Leave her alone,”  said Jesus,  “so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial.	12	OEB
John	12	8	The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.”	12	OEB
John	12	9	Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.	12	OEB
John	12	10	The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,	12	OEB
John	12	11	because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.	12	OEB
John	12	12	On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,	12	OEB
John	12	13	and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord – the king of Israel!”	12	OEB
John	12	14	Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –	12	OEB
John	12	15	‘Fear not, people of Zion. Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey.’	12	OEB
John	12	16	His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.	12	OEB
John	12	17	Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.	12	OEB
John	12	18	This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.	12	OEB
John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!”	12	OEB
John	12	20	Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,	12	OEB
John	12	21	who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”	12	OEB
John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.	12	OEB
John	12	23	This was his reply –  “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.	12	OEB
John	12	24	In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful.	12	OEB
John	12	25	A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life.	12	OEB
John	12	26	If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them.	12	OEB
John	12	27	Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour –	12	OEB
John	12	28	Father, honor your own name.”  At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.”	12	OEB
John	12	29	The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.”	12	OEB
John	12	30	“It was not for my sake that the voice came,”  said Jesus,  “but for yours.	12	OEB
John	12	31	Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out;	12	OEB
John	12	32	and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”	12	OEB
John	12	33	By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.	12	OEB
John	12	34	“We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be  ‘lifted up’  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”	12	OEB
John	12	35	“Only a little while longer,”  answered Jesus,  “will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going.	12	OEB
John	12	36	While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.”  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.	12	OEB
John	12	37	But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,	12	OEB
John	12	38	in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’	12	OEB
John	12	39	The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words –	12	OEB
John	12	40	‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.’	12	OEB
John	12	41	Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.	12	OEB
John	12	42	Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues;	12	OEB
John	12	43	for they valued honor from people more than honor from God.	12	OEB
John	12	44	But Jesus had proclaimed,  “He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me;	12	OEB
John	12	45	and he who sees me sees him who sent me.	12	OEB
John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness.	12	OEB
John	12	47	When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.	12	OEB
John	12	48	He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day.	12	OEB
John	12	49	For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver.	12	OEB
John	12	50	And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.”	12	OEB
John	13	1	Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.	12	OEB
John	13	2	The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;	12	OEB
John	13	3	and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God –	12	OEB
John	13	4	rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist.	12	OEB
John	13	5	He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him.	12	OEB
John	13	6	When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?”	12	OEB
John	13	7	“You do not understand now what I am doing,”  replied Jesus,  “but you will learn by and by.”	12	OEB
John	13	8	“You will never wash my feet!” exclaimed Peter.  “Unless I wash you,”  answered Jesus,  “you have nothing in common with me.”	12	OEB
John	13	9	“Then, Master, not my feet only,” exclaimed Simon Peter, “but also my hands and my head.”	12	OEB
John	13	10	“He who has bathed,”  replied Jesus,  “has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,”  he said to the disciples,  “are clean, yet not all of you.”	12	OEB
John	13	11	For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said  ‘You are not all clean.’	12	OEB
John	13	12	When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again.  “Do you understand what I have been doing to you?”  he asked.	12	OEB
John	13	13	“You yourselves call me ‘the teacher’ and ‘the Master’, and you are right, for I am both.	12	OEB
John	13	14	If I, then – ‘the Master’ and ‘the teacher’ – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet;	12	OEB
John	13	15	for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you.	12	OEB
John	13	16	In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them.	12	OEB
John	13	17	Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them.	12	OEB
John	13	18	I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’	12	OEB
John	13	19	For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am.	12	OEB
John	13	20	In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.”	12	OEB
John	13	21	After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,  “In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.”	12	OEB
John	13	22	The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.	12	OEB
John	13	23	Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.	12	OEB
John	13	24	So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, “Tell me who it is that he means.”	12	OEB
John	13	25	Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, “Who is it, Master?”	12	OEB
John	13	26	“It is the one,”  answered Jesus,  “to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.”  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;	12	OEB
John	13	27	and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him,  “Do at once what you are going to do.”	12	OEB
John	13	28	But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.	12	OEB
John	13	29	Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.	12	OEB
John	13	30	After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.	12	OEB
John	13	31	When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,  “Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him;	12	OEB
John	13	32	and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith.	12	OEB
John	13	33	My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – ‘You cannot come where I am going’ – I now say to you.	12	OEB
John	13	34	I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you.	12	OEB
John	13	35	It is by this that everyone will recognize you as my disciples – by your loving one another.”	12	OEB
John	13	36	“Where are you going, Master?” asked Peter.  “I am going where you cannot now follow me,”  answered Jesus,  “but you will follow me later.”	12	OEB
John	13	37	“Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.”	12	OEB
John	13	38	“Will you lay down your life for me?”  replied Jesus.  “In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times.	12	OEB
John	14	1	Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.	12	OEB
John	14	2	In my Father’s home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.	12	OEB
John	14	3	And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am;	12	OEB
John	14	4	and you know the way to the place where I am going.”	12	OEB
John	14	5	“We do not know where you are going, Master,” said Thomas. “So how can we know the way?”	12	OEB
John	14	6	Jesus answered,  “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me.	12	OEB
John	14	7	If you had recognized me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognize him, indeed you have already seen him.”	12	OEB
John	14	8	“Master, show us the Father,” said Philip, “and we will be satisfied.”	12	OEB
John	14	9	“Have I been all this time among you,”  said Jesus,  “and yet you, Philip, have not recognized me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, ‘Show us the Father’?	12	OEB
John	14	10	Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work.	12	OEB
John	14	11	Believe me,” he said to them all, “when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself.	12	OEB
John	14	12	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father.	12	OEB
John	14	13	Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honored in the Son.	12	OEB
John	14	14	If you ask anything, in my name, I will do it.	12	OEB
John	14	15	If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart,	12	OEB
John	14	16	and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you always – the Spirit of truth.	12	OEB
John	14	17	The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognize him, but you recognize him, because he is always with you, and is within you.	12	OEB
John	14	18	I will not leave you bereaved; I will come to you.	12	OEB
John	14	19	In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living also.	12	OEB
John	14	20	At that time you will recognize that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you.	12	OEB
John	14	21	It is they who have my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.”	12	OEB
John	14	22	“What has happened, Master,” said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), “that you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”	12	OEB
John	14	23	“Whoever loves me,”  Jesus answered,  “will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.	12	OEB
John	14	24	The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me.	12	OEB
John	14	25	I have told you all this while still with you,	12	OEB
John	14	26	but the helper – the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name – will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you.	12	OEB
John	14	27	Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed.	12	OEB
John	14	28	You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.	12	OEB
John	14	29	And this I have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you may still believe in me.	12	OEB
John	14	30	I will not talk with you much more, for the Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with me;	12	OEB
John	14	31	but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going.	12	OEB
John	15	1	“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower.	12	OEB
John	15	2	Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, so that it may bear more fruit.	12	OEB
John	15	3	You are already clean because of the message that I have given you.	12	OEB
John	15	4	Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me.	12	OEB
John	15	5	I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remains united to me, while I remain united to you – you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me.	12	OEB
John	15	6	If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt.	12	OEB
John	15	7	If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours.	12	OEB
John	15	8	It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honored.	12	OEB
John	15	9	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.	12	OEB
John	15	10	If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father’s commands to heart and remain in his love.	12	OEB
John	15	11	I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete.	12	OEB
John	15	12	This is my command – love one another, as I have loved you.	12	OEB
John	15	13	No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends.	12	OEB
John	15	14	And you are my friends, if you do what I command you.	12	OEB
John	15	15	I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father.	12	OEB
John	15	16	It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name.	12	OEB
John	15	17	I am giving you these commands that you may love one another.	12	OEB
John	15	18	If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me.	12	OEB
John	15	19	If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you.	12	OEB
John	15	20	Remember what I said to you – ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.	12	OEB
John	15	21	But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me.	12	OEB
John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.	12	OEB
John	15	23	The person who hates me hates my Father also.	12	OEB
John	15	24	If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.	12	OEB
John	15	25	And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – ‘They hated me without cause.’	12	OEB
John	15	26	But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me;	12	OEB
John	15	27	yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first.	12	OEB
John	16	1	“I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.	12	OEB
John	16	2	They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.	12	OEB
John	16	3	They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me.	12	OEB
John	16	4	But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.	12	OEB
John	16	5	I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – ‘Where are you going?’	12	OEB
John	16	6	Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.	12	OEB
John	16	7	Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.	12	OEB
John	16	8	And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment;	12	OEB
John	16	9	as to sin, for people do not believe in me;	12	OEB
John	16	10	as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;	12	OEB
John	16	11	as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.	12	OEB
John	16	12	I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.	12	OEB
John	16	13	Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.	12	OEB
John	16	14	He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.	12	OEB
John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.	12	OEB
John	16	16	In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.”	12	OEB
John	16	17	At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us  ‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’;  and by saying  ‘Because I am going to the Father’?	12	OEB
John	16	18	What does he mean by  ‘In a little while’?”  they said. “We do not know what he is speaking about.”	12	OEB
John	16	19	Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said,  “Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’?	12	OEB
John	16	20	In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy.	12	OEB
John	16	21	A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world.	12	OEB
John	16	22	You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.	12	OEB
John	16	23	And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name.	12	OEB
John	16	24	So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.	12	OEB
John	16	25	I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly.	12	OEB
John	16	26	You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;	12	OEB
John	16	27	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.	12	OEB
John	16	28	I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.”	12	OEB
John	16	29	“At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.	12	OEB
John	16	30	Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.”	12	OEB
John	16	31	“Do you believe that already?”  Jesus answered.	12	OEB
John	16	32	“Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.	12	OEB
John	16	33	I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.”	12	OEB
John	17	1	After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heavenwards, and said:	12	OEB
John	17	2	even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to everyone you have given him.	12	OEB
John	17	3	And the eternal life is this – to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent as your messenger.	12	OEB
John	17	4	I have honored you on earth by completing the work which you have given me to do;	12	OEB
John	17	5	and now do you honor me, Father, at your own side, with the honor which I had at your side before the world began.	12	OEB
John	17	6	I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart.	12	OEB
John	17	7	They recognize now that everything that you gave me was from you;	12	OEB
John	17	8	for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you have sent me as your messenger.	12	OEB
John	17	9	I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are your own –	12	OEB
John	17	10	All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine – and I am honored in them.	12	OEB
John	17	11	Now I am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world, and I am to come to you. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of your name which you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are.	12	OEB
John	17	12	While I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul – in fulfillment of scripture.	12	OEB
John	17	13	But now I am to come to you; and I am speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts.	12	OEB
John	17	14	I have given them your message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.	12	OEB
John	17	15	I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil.	12	OEB
John	17	16	They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.	12	OEB
John	17	17	Consecrate them by the truth; your message is truth.	12	OEB
John	17	18	Just as you have sent me as your messenger to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world.	12	OEB
John	17	19	And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated.	12	OEB
John	17	20	But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message,	12	OEB
John	17	21	that they all may be one – that as you, Father, are in union with us – and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.	12	OEB
John	17	22	I have given them the honor which you have given me, so that they may be one as we are one –	12	OEB
John	17	23	I in union with them and you with me – so that they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me.	12	OEB
John	17	24	Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for you did love me before the beginning of the world.	12	OEB
John	17	25	Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger.	12	OEB
John	17	26	I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.”	12	OEB
John	18	1	When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.	12	OEB
John	18	2	The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.	12	OEB
John	18	3	So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.	12	OEB
John	18	4	Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them,  “For whom are you looking?”	12	OEB
John	18	5	“Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer.  “I am he,”  said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)	12	OEB
John	18	6	When Jesus said  ‘I am he,’  they drew back and fell to the ground.	12	OEB
John	18	7	So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”	12	OEB
John	18	8	“I have already told you that I am he,”  replied Jesus,  “so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.”	12	OEB
John	18	9	This was in fulfillment of his words –  ‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’	12	OEB
John	18	10	At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.	12	OEB
John	18	11	But Jesus said to Peter,  “Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?”	12	OEB
John	18	12	So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him,	12	OEB
John	18	13	and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.	12	OEB
John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.	12	OEB
John	18	15	Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,	12	OEB
John	18	16	while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.	12	OEB
John	18	17	So the maidservant said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?”	12	OEB
John	18	18	The servants and guards were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.	12	OEB
John	18	19	The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.	12	OEB
John	18	20	“For my part,”  answered Jesus,  “I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret.	12	OEB
John	18	21	Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.”	12	OEB
John	18	22	When Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.	12	OEB
John	18	23	“If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,”  replied Jesus,  “but if not, why do you strike me?”	12	OEB
John	18	24	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.	12	OEB
John	18	25	Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.	12	OEB
John	18	26	One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?”	12	OEB
John	18	27	Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.	12	OEB
John	18	28	From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.	12	OEB
John	18	29	Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.	12	OEB
John	18	30	“If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.	12	OEB
John	18	31	“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.”	12	OEB
John	18	32	in fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.	12	OEB
John	18	33	After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”	12	OEB
John	18	34	“Do you ask me that yourself?”  replied Jesus,  “or did others say it to you about me?”	12	OEB
John	18	35	“Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?”	12	OEB
John	18	36	“My kingly power,”  replied Jesus,  “is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.”	12	OEB
John	18	37	“So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate.  “Yes, it is true I am a king,”  answered Jesus.  “I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.”	12	OEB
John	18	38	“What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.	12	OEB
John	18	39	It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”	12	OEB
John	18	40	“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.	12	OEB
John	19	1	After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.	12	OEB
John	19	2	The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.	12	OEB
John	19	3	They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.	12	OEB
John	19	4	Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”	12	OEB
John	19	5	Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”	12	OEB
John	19	6	When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”	12	OEB
John	19	7	“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”	12	OEB
John	19	8	When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;	12	OEB
John	19	9	and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”	12	OEB
John	19	10	But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”	12	OEB
John	19	11	“You would have no power over me at all,”  answered Jesus,  “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”	12	OEB
John	19	12	This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”	12	OEB
John	19	13	On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’	12	OEB
John	19	14	It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”	12	OEB
John	19	15	At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”	12	OEB
John	19	16	so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.	12	OEB
John	19	17	and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.	12	OEB
John	19	18	There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.	12	OEB
John	19	19	Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’	12	OEB
John	19	20	These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.	12	OEB
John	19	21	The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”	12	OEB
John	19	22	But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”	12	OEB
John	19	23	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.	12	OEB
John	19	24	So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture –	12	OEB
John	19	25	Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.	12	OEB
John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother,  “There is your son.”	12	OEB
John	19	27	Then he said to that disciple,  “There is your mother.”  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.	12	OEB
John	19	28	Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture,  “I am thirsty.”	12	OEB
John	19	29	There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.	12	OEB
John	19	30	When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed,  “All is finished!”  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.	12	OEB
John	19	31	It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.	12	OEB
John	19	32	Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;	12	OEB
John	19	33	but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.	12	OEB
John	19	34	One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.	12	OEB
John	19	35	This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.	12	OEB
John	19	36	For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’	12	OEB
John	19	37	And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’	12	OEB
John	19	38	After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.	12	OEB
John	19	39	Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.	12	OEB
John	19	40	They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.	12	OEB
John	19	41	At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.	12	OEB
John	19	42	And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.	12	OEB
John	20	1	On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.	12	OEB
John	20	2	So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”	12	OEB
John	20	3	So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.	12	OEB
John	20	4	The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.	12	OEB
John	20	5	Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.	12	OEB
John	20	6	Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,	12	OEB
John	20	7	and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.	12	OEB
John	20	8	Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.	12	OEB
John	20	9	For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.	12	OEB
John	20	10	The disciples then returned to their companions.	12	OEB
John	20	11	Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,	12	OEB
John	20	12	and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.	12	OEB
John	20	13	“Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”	12	OEB
John	20	14	After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.	12	OEB
John	20	15	“Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.”	12	OEB
John	20	16	“Mary!”  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).	12	OEB
John	20	17	“Do not hold me,”  Jesus said,  “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.”	12	OEB
John	20	18	Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.	12	OEB
John	20	19	In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  “Peace be with you”;	12	OEB
John	20	20	after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.	12	OEB
John	20	21	Again Jesus said to them,  “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.”	12	OEB
John	20	22	After saying this, he breathed on them, and said,  “Receive the Holy Spirit;	12	OEB
John	20	23	if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.”	12	OEB
John	20	24	But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came;	12	OEB
John	20	25	so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!”	12	OEB
John	20	26	A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said,  “Peace be with you.”	12	OEB
John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas,  “Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.”	12	OEB
John	20	28	And Thomas exclaimed, “My Master, and my God!”	12	OEB
John	20	29	“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?”  said Jesus.  “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!”	12	OEB
John	20	30	There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;	12	OEB
John	20	31	but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.	12	OEB
John	21	1	Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.	12	OEB
John	21	2	It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,	12	OEB
John	21	3	“I am going fishing.”	12	OEB
John	21	4	Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.	12	OEB
John	21	5	“My children,”  he said,  “have you anything to eat?”	12	OEB
John	21	6	“Cast your net to the right of the boat,”  he said,  “and you will find fish.”  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.	12	OEB
John	21	7	The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.	12	OEB
John	21	8	But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.	12	OEB
John	21	9	When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.	12	OEB
John	21	10	“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”  said Jesus.	12	OEB
John	21	11	So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.	12	OEB
John	21	12	“Come and have breakfast.” , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.	12	OEB
John	21	13	Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.	12	OEB
John	21	14	This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.	12	OEB
John	21	15	When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?”	12	OEB
John	21	16	Then, a second time, Jesus asked,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”	12	OEB
John	21	17	The third time, Jesus said to him,  “Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.”	12	OEB
John	21	18	“In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.”	12	OEB
John	21	19	Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added,  “Follow me.”	12	OEB
John	21	20	Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.	12	OEB
John	21	21	Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?”	12	OEB
John	21	22	“If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”  answered Jesus,  “what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.”	12	OEB
John	21	23	So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said  “If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?”	12	OEB
John	21	24	It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.	12	OEB
John	21	25	There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.	12	OEB
Philemon	1	1	From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	2	To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;	13	OEB
Philemon	1	3	may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	4	I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,	13	OEB
Philemon	1	5	because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;	13	OEB
Philemon	1	6	and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	7	I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s people have been cheered, friend, by you.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	8	And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,	13	OEB
Philemon	1	9	yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	10	I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	11	Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;	13	OEB
Philemon	1	12	and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	13	For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	14	But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	15	It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,	13	OEB
Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!	13	OEB
Philemon	1	17	If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	18	If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	20	Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	21	Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	22	Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;	13	OEB
Philemon	1	24	and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.	13	OEB
Philemon	1	25	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.	13	OEB
Philippians	1	1	To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	3	Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thanksgiving to God,	14	OEB
Philippians	1	4	always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –	14	OEB
Philippians	1	5	because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	6	For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	7	And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	8	God will bear me witness how I yearn for you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	9	And what I pray for is this – that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,	14	OEB
Philippians	1	10	until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,	14	OEB
Philippians	1	11	bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	12	Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	13	It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	14	And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	15	It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of jealousy and opposition, but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	16	The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	17	The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	18	But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	19	Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	20	And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as before, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,	14	OEB
Philippians	1	21	for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	22	But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!	14	OEB
Philippians	1	23	My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	24	But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	25	Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;	14	OEB
Philippians	1	26	so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	27	Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,	14	OEB
Philippians	1	28	without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	29	For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.	14	OEB
Philippians	1	30	You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	1	If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	2	I entreat you to make my happiness complete – live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	3	Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	4	considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	5	Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	6	Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	7	but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;	14	OEB
Philippians	2	8	he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross!	14	OEB
Philippians	2	9	And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	10	so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	12	Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	13	Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	14	In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	15	so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,	14	OEB
Philippians	2	16	offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	17	And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;	14	OEB
Philippians	2	18	and you must also rejoice and share my joy.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	19	I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	20	For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	21	They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	22	But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	23	It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	24	And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	25	Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	26	For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	27	And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	28	I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	29	Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.	14	OEB
Philippians	2	30	For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	1	In conclusion, my friends, may all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	2	Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!	14	OEB
Philippians	3	3	For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;	14	OEB
Philippians	3	4	though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!	14	OEB
Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;	14	OEB
Philippians	3	6	as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	7	But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	8	More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as rubbish, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;	14	OEB
Philippians	3	9	any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	10	Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,	14	OEB
Philippians	3	11	in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	13	For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,	14	OEB
Philippians	3	14	I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	15	Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	16	Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	17	My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	18	For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	19	The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.	14	OEB
Philippians	3	21	By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	1	So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	2	I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;	14	OEB
Philippians	4	3	yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	4	All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	5	Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	6	Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	7	Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	8	In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honor have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	9	All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	10	It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	11	Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	12	I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	13	I can do everything through the strength of the one who makes me strong!	14	OEB
Philippians	4	14	Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	15	And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	16	Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	17	It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	18	My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	19	And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	20	To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	21	Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	22	All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.	14	OEB
Philippians	4	23	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.	14	OEB
Psalms	1	1	Happy are those who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, not halting in ways frequented by sinners, nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.	15	OEB
Psalms	1	2	But the law of the LORD  is their joy, they study it day and night.	15	OEB
Psalms	1	3	They are like trees planted by runlets of water, yielding fruit in due season, leaves never fading. In all that they do, they prosper.	15	OEB
Psalms	1	4	Not so fare the wicked, not so; like chaff are they, blown by the wind.	15	OEB
Psalms	1	5	So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.	15	OEB
Psalms	1	6	For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD, but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	1	Why this turmoil of nations, this futile plotting of peoples,	15	OEB
Psalms	2	2	with kings of the earth conspiring, and rulers consulting together, against the LORD  and against his anointed,	15	OEB
Psalms	2	3	to snap their bonds and fling their cords away?	15	OEB
Psalms	2	4	He whose throne is in heaven laughs, the LORD  mocks them.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	5	Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his hot anger confounds them.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	6	“This my king is installed by me, on Zion my holy mountain.”	15	OEB
Psalms	2	7	I will tell of the LORD ’s decree. He said to me: “You are my son, this day I became your father.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	8	Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	9	You will break them with sceptre of iron, shatter them like pottery.”	15	OEB
Psalms	2	10	So now, you kings, be wise: be warned, you rulers of earth.	15	OEB
Psalms	2	11	Serve the LORD  in awe, kiss his feet with trembling,	15	OEB
Psalms	2	12	lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; for soon will his fury blaze. Happy all who take refuge in him.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	1	How many, LORD, are my foes! Those who rise up against me are many.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	2	Many are those who say of me, “There is no help for him in his God.” *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	3	3	But you, LORD, are shield about me, my glory, who lifts up my head.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	4	When loudly I call to the LORD, from his holy hill he gives answer. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	3	5	I laid down and slept: now I wake, for the LORD  sustains me.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	6	I fear not the myriads of people who beset me on every side.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	7	Arise, LORD : save me, my God, who strikes all my foes on the cheek, and shatters the teeth of the wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	3	8	Victory belongs to the LORD : let your blessing descend on your people. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	4	1	Answer my cry, God, my defender. Often from straits you have brought me to spacious places. So now show me your favor and hear my prayer.	15	OEB
Psalms	4	2	How long, you proud people, will my honor be stained by the slanders you love, and the lies that you follow? *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	4	3	See! The LORD  has shown me his wonderful kindness: the LORD  hears, when I call to him.	15	OEB
Psalms	4	4	Sin not in your anger: but speak in your heart on your bed, and be still. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	4	5	Offer true sacrifice, trust in the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	4	6	Many are longing for fortune to smile. Lift upon us the light of your face.	15	OEB
Psalms	4	7	You have put in my heart, LORD, a deeper joy than was theirs who had corn and wine in abundance.	15	OEB
Psalms	4	8	So in peace I will lie down and sleep; for you, LORD, keep me safe.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	1	Hear my words, LORD : give heed to my whisper.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	2	Attend to my loud cry for help, my king and my God.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	3	When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning, hear my voice. I make ready for you in the morning, and look for a sign.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	4	For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: no one of evil can be your guest.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	5	No braggarts can stand in your presence, you hate all workers of wrong.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	6	You destroy all speakers of lies, people of blood and deceit you abhor.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	7	But I, through your kindness abundant, may enter your house, and towards the shrine of your temple may reverently bow.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	8	Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way level before me.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	9	For their mouth is a stranger to truth, their heart is a pit of destruction. Their throat is a wide open grave, their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	10	Condemn them, God; let their schemes bring them down to the ground. For their numberless crimes thrust them down for playing the rebel against you.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	11	But let all who take refuge in you ring out their gladness forever. Protect those who love your name, so they may exult in you.	15	OEB
Psalms	5	12	For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly, and the shield of your favor protects them.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	1	Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger, punish me not in your wrath.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	2	LORD, be gracious to me in my weakness. Heal me LORD, for racked is my body;	15	OEB
Psalms	6	3	all of me utterly racked. Why do you wait so long, LORD ?	15	OEB
Psalms	6	4	Turn, LORD, rescue me; save me, because of your love.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	5	For in death none can call you to mind; in Sheol who can praise you?	15	OEB
Psalms	6	6	I am so weary of sighing. All the night I make my bed swim, and wet my couch with my tears.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	7	My eyes swollen with grief; from weeping caused by my foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	8	Begone, workers of wrong, for the LORD  has heard my loud weeping,	15	OEB
Psalms	6	9	the LORD  has heard my entreaty, the LORD  accepts my prayer.	15	OEB
Psalms	6	10	My foes will be stricken with terror, brought to shame and dismay in a moment.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	1	LORD  my God, I take refuge in you. Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;	15	OEB
Psalms	7	2	or like lions they will tear me to pieces, and rend me, past hope of rescue.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	3	LORD, my God, if my life has been such if my hands have been stained with guilt,	15	OEB
Psalms	7	4	if friends I paid back with evil, if I plundered my foes without cause,	15	OEB
Psalms	7	5	may the enemy chase and find me, trample my life to the ground, my honor leave in the dirt! *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	7	6	Arise, LORD, in anger, against my foes rise in fury. Awake for my help: let justice be done.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	7	Gather the nations about you, and sit on your lofty throne,	15	OEB
Psalms	7	8	as the LORD, the judge of the peoples. Judge me, LORD, in my innocence and according to my integrity.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	9	Put an end to the wrong of the wicked, protect the righteous. Searcher of hearts and minds, righteous God.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	10	God is my shield: he saves the upright in heart.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	11	God is a just judge, constant in righteous anger.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	12	He will sharpen his sword without fail, his bow is bent and ready,	15	OEB
Psalms	7	13	his deadly weapons are ready, his arrows he makes of flame.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	14	The enemy who conceives evil; pregnant with mischief, giving birth to lies,	15	OEB
Psalms	7	15	a pit they have made and dug; but into the hole that they made they will fall.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	16	On their own heads their mischief comes back; on their own skulls their violence comes down.	15	OEB
Psalms	7	17	I will give thanks to the LORD  for his justice, and sing to the name of the LORD  Most High.	15	OEB
Psalms	8	1	LORD  our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name! Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,	15	OEB
Psalms	8	2	from the mouths of children and infants.  You have built a fortress against your enemies, to silence the foe and the rebel.	15	OEB
Psalms	8	3	When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set there,	15	OEB
Psalms	8	4	what are mortals, that you think of them, humans, that you visit them?	15	OEB
Psalms	8	5	Yet you made them little less than divine, crowned them with glory and majesty,	15	OEB
Psalms	8	6	made them lord of the works of your hands, put all things under their feet –	15	OEB
Psalms	8	7	sheep and oxen, all of them; and the wild beasts also:	15	OEB
Psalms	8	8	birds of the air, and fish of the sea, and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.	15	OEB
Psalms	8	9	LORD  our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name!	15	OEB
Psalms	9	1	With all my heart I will praise the LORD, all your wonders I will rehearse.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	2	I will rejoice and exult in you, singing praise to your name, Most High;	15	OEB
Psalms	9	3	because backward my foes were turned, they stumbled and perished before you.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	4	My right and my claim you have upheld, you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,	15	OEB
Psalms	9	5	rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked, and blotting their name out forever and ever.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	6	The foe is vanished, ruined forever, their cities destroyed, their memory perished.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	7	See! The LORD  is seated forever on the throne he established for judgment,	15	OEB
Psalms	9	8	ruling the world with justice, and judging the nations with equity.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	9	So the LORD  proves a haven to the oppressed, a haven in times of trouble.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	10	Well may they trust you who know your name, for those who seek you, you never abandon.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	11	Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion, declare his deeds among the nations.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	12	As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind, he does not forget the cry of the wretched.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	13	Show me favor, LORD, see how my foes afflict me, lift me up from the gates of death;	15	OEB
Psalms	9	14	so I may, in your help exulting, tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	15	The nations are sunk in the pit which they made, in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	16	The LORD  is revealed in the judgment he wrought, the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	9	17	Let the wicked depart to Sheol, all the nations that live forgetful of God.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	18	For the needy will not be always forgotten, nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	19	Arise, LORD ; don’t let them triumph: before your face let the nations be judged.	15	OEB
Psalms	9	20	Strike them with fear, LORD : show the nations how frail they are. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	10	1	Why do you stand, LORD, so far away, hiding yourself in times of trouble?	15	OEB
Psalms	10	2	The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless: let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	3	For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed; the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,	15	OEB
Psalms	10	4	in wicked pride, thinks: God doesn’t care, God doesn’t call to account.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	5	Never a season that they do not prosper; your judgments are far above out of their sight: they scoff at their foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	6	Each says in their heart, “I will never be shaken; I will live for all time untouched by misfortune.”	15	OEB
Psalms	10	7	Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression: under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	8	Lying in secret in some village ambush, and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	9	Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair they lurk intending to catch the defenceless; to seize them, to drag them away in their net.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	10	Their victims are crushed, sink down to the ground. Under their claws the hapless fall.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	11	The wicked say in their hearts that God has forgotten, has hidden his face, will see nothing.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	12	Arise, LORD, lift up your hand, do not forget the cry of the wretched.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	13	Why do the wicked treat God with contempt, and say in their hearts, “God doesn’t care”?	15	OEB
Psalms	10	14	You have seen the trouble and sorrow; you mark it all, and will take it in hand. The hapless can count on you, helper of orphans.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	15	Break the arm of the wicked and evil: search out their sin, till no more be found.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	16	The LORD  is king forever and ever: the nations will vanish from his land.	15	OEB
Psalms	10	17	LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble, inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,	15	OEB
Psalms	10	18	rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan, so no one on earth may strike terror again.	15	OEB
Psalms	11	1	In the LORD  I take refuge. How can you tell me to flee like a bird to the mountains?	15	OEB
Psalms	11	2	“See! The wicked are bending the bow, their arrow is set on the string, to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.	15	OEB
Psalms	11	3	In this tearing down of foundations what good can a good person do?”	15	OEB
Psalms	11	4	The LORD  in his holy temple, the LORD  in heaven, enthroned. His eyes watch the world, they see everyone.	15	OEB
Psalms	11	5	The LORD  examines the righteous and wicked, and the lover of violence he hates.	15	OEB
Psalms	11	6	On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone, and their drink will be scorching wind.	15	OEB
Psalms	11	7	For the LORD  is just, and justice he loves; so the upright will see his face.	15	OEB
Psalms	12	1	Help, LORD, for the good are all gone, faithful people have vanished.	15	OEB
Psalms	12	2	One lies to another, speaking empty lies, with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.	15	OEB
Psalms	12	3	May the LORD  cut off all the flattering lips, and the tongue that utters arrogance,	15	OEB
Psalms	12	4	they declare, “Our tongue is our strength, our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”	15	OEB
Psalms	12	5	“The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing; so now I will act,” the LORD  declares “And place them in the safety they long for.”	15	OEB
Psalms	12	6	The words of the LORD  are words that are pure, silver smelted, seven times refined.	15	OEB
Psalms	12	7	You will keep us, LORD, and guard us from this generation forever,	15	OEB
Psalms	12	8	in a world where the wicked prowl, and worthless people exalted.	15	OEB
Psalms	13	1	How long, LORD, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?	15	OEB
Psalms	13	2	How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?	15	OEB
Psalms	13	3	Look at me, answer me, LORD  my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death,	15	OEB
Psalms	13	4	lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.	15	OEB
Psalms	13	5	But I trust in your kindness: my heart will rejoice in your help.	15	OEB
Psalms	13	6	I will sing to the LORD  who was good to me.	15	OEB
Psalms	14	1	Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.	15	OEB
Psalms	14	2	From heaven the LORD  looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.	15	OEB
Psalms	14	3	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.	15	OEB
Psalms	14	4	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	14	5	Sore afraid will they be; for God is among those who are righteous,	15	OEB
Psalms	14	6	you may mock the plans of the poor, but the LORD  is their refuge.	15	OEB
Psalms	14	7	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When the LORD  brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!	15	OEB
Psalms	15	1	LORD, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?	15	OEB
Psalms	15	2	The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere;	15	OEB
Psalms	15	3	on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend,	15	OEB
Psalms	15	4	nor cruelly insult a neighbor, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honors those who obey the LORD, who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,	15	OEB
Psalms	15	5	whose money is lent without interest, and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.  The person who does these things will always stand firm.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	1	Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	2	I said to the LORD, “You are my LORD, my happiness rests in you alone.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	3	Those who are holy in the land, they, they alone, are the noble ones; all my delight is in them.”	15	OEB
Psalms	16	4	Those who choose other gods find endless sorrow. In their offerings of blood I will have no part nor take their name on my lips.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	5	The LORD  is my share and my portion, my fate is in your strong hands.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	6	The boundary lines of my life mark out delightful country, my heritage pleases me well.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	7	I praise the LORD  for his counsel, which so stirs my heart in the night.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	8	I keep the LORD  always in mind: with him at my hand, I can never be moved.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	9	So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me; and in safety of body I live.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	10	For you will not give me up to Sheol nor let any who love you see the pit.	15	OEB
Psalms	16	11	You will show me the path that leads to life, to that fulness of joy which is in your presence, and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	1	Listen, O LORD, to my innocence; attend to my piercing cry. Give heed to my prayer out of lips unfeigned.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	2	Let my vindication come from you, your eyes see the truth.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	3	When you test my heart when you visit at night, and assay me like silver – you can find no evil. I am determined that my mouth should not lie.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	4	I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	5	My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	6	So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	7	Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemies those who take refuge at your right hand.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	8	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shelter of your wings.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	9	From wicked people who do me violence, from deadly foes who crowd around me.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	10	They have closed their hearts to pity, the words of their mouths are haughty.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	11	Now they dog us at every step, keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,	15	OEB
Psalms	17	12	like a lion, longing to tear, like a young lion, lurking in secret.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	13	Arise, LORD, face them and fell them. By your sword set me free from the wicked,	15	OEB
Psalms	17	14	by your hand, O LORD, from those – whose portion of life is but of this world. But let your treasured ones have food in plenty may their children be full and their children satisfied.	15	OEB
Psalms	17	15	In my innocence I will see your face, awake I am filled with a vision of you.	15	OEB
Psalms	18	1	I love you, O LORD, my strength.	15	OEB
Psalms	18	2	The LORD  is my rock, my fortress, deliverer, my God, my rock, where I take refuge, my shield, my defender, my tower.	15	OEB

Psalms	32	3	When I held my peace, my bones wore away with my endless groaning;	15	OEB

Psalms	35	15	When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered, strangers gathered around me, and tore at me without ceasing,	15	OEB
Psalms	35	16	impiously mocking and mocking, bearing their teeth at me.	15	OEB

Psalms	35	19	Suffer not those to rejoice over me who are falsely my foes, suffer not those who without cause abhor me to wink with the eye.	15	OEB
Psalms	35	20	For it is not peace that they speak of those who are quiet in the land; but treacherous charges they plot.	15	OEB
Psalms	35	21	With wide open mouths they shout, “Hurrah! Hurrah! With our own eyes we saw it.”	15	OEB

Psalms	35	24	You are just, LORD : win for me justice, let them not rejoice over me,	15	OEB
Psalms	35	25	inwardly saying, “Hurrah! The desire of our hearts at last! Now we have swallowed him up.”	15	OEB
Psalms	35	26	Shame and confusion together on those who rejoice at my hurt! Clothed with shame and dishonor be those who are haughty to me!	15	OEB
Psalms	35	27	Let such as delight in my cause ring out their gladness, and say evermore, “Great is the LORD  whose delight is the well-being of his servant.”	15	OEB
Psalms	35	28	Then my tongue will tell of your justice, and all the day long of your praise.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	1	Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked, who have no dread of God before their eyes.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	2	It flatters them in their eyes that their sin will not be found out.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	3	First, their speech becomes wicked and false, they give up acting wisely and well.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	4	Then they plot deliberate wrong, take their stand on the wicked way, without the least shrinking from evil.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	5	Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens, your faithfulness reaches the clouds.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	6	Your justice is like the great mountains, your judgments are like the broad sea. LORD, you save people and animals.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	7	How precious your love, O God! All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	8	They feast on the fat of your house, they drink of your brook of delights.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	9	For with you is the fountain of life, in the light that is yours we see light.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	10	O continue your grace to the faithful, your love to the upright in heart.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	11	Let no arrogant foot tread upon me, no wicked hand drive me to exile.	15	OEB
Psalms	36	12	There the workers of wrong lie prostrate, thrust down to rise up no more.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	1	Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked, nor envious of those who work wrong;	15	OEB
Psalms	37	2	for, like grass, they will speedily wither, and fade like the green of young grass.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	3	Trust in the LORD, and do good; remain in the land, and deal faithfully:	15	OEB
Psalms	37	4	then the LORD  will be your delight, he will grant you your heart’s petitions.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	5	Commit your way to the LORD ; trust in him, and he will act,	15	OEB
Psalms	37	6	making clear as the light your right, and your just cause clear as the noon-day.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	7	In silence and patience wait on the LORD . Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper. At those who execute evil devices.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	8	Desist from anger, abandon wrath: be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:	15	OEB
Psalms	37	9	for evildoers will be cut off, but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	37	10	Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish: look at their place: they are there no more.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	11	But the humble will have the land, and the rapture of peace in abundance.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	12	The wicked plots against the righteous, snarls like a wild animal;	15	OEB
Psalms	37	13	the LORD  laughs, for he sees that his day is coming.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	14	The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow, to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;	15	OEB
Psalms	37	15	but their sword will pierce their own heart, and their bows will be broken in pieces.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	16	Better is the righteous person’s little than the wealth of many wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD  upholds the righteous.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	18	The LORD  watches over the days of the blameless, their heritage will continue forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	19	They will not be shamed in the evil time, in the days of famine they will be satisfied.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	20	Because the wicked will perish: but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven, will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	21	The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back, but the righteous is lavish and gives.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	22	For those blest by the LORD  inherit the land, while those whom he curses will be cut off.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	23	The LORD  supports the steps of those with whom he is pleased.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	24	Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong, for the LORD  holds their hands.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	25	Never, from youth to age, have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	26	They are ever lavishly lending, and their children are fountains of blessing.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	27	Turn away from evil and do good and you will live in the land forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	28	For the LORD  loves justice, he does not forsake his friends.  The unrighteous will be destroyed forever, and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	29	But the land will belong to the righteous, they will live upon it forever,	15	OEB
Psalms	37	30	The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom, and words of justice are on their tongues.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	31	The law of their God is in their heart, their steps are never unsteady.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	32	The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to put them to death.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	33	But the LORD  leaves them not in their hand: at their trial they will not be held guilty.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	34	Wait on the LORD, and observe his way: he will lift you to honor the land will be yours, you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	35	I have seen the wicked exultant, lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	36	But the moment I passed, they vanished! I sought for them, but they could not be found.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	37	Preserve your honor and practise uprightness, for such a person fares well in the end.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	38	But transgressors will perish together. Cut off are the wicked forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	37	39	The righteous are saved by the LORD, who in time of distress is their refuge:	15	OEB
Psalms	37	40	the LORD  helps and rescue them, from the wicked he rescues and saves them, because they take refuge in him.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	1	Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger, and chasten me not in your wrath;	15	OEB
Psalms	38	2	for your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand lies heavy upon me.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	3	In my flesh is no soundness because of your anger, no health in my bones, because of my sin.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	4	For that my guilt is gone over my head: it weighs like a burden too heavy for me.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	5	My wounds stink and fester, for my foolishness I am tormented.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	6	Bent and bowed am I utterly, all the day going in mourning.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	7	My loins are filled with burning, and in my flesh is no soundness.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	8	I am utterly crushed and numb; I cry louder than lion roars.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	9	LORD, you know all that I long for, my groans are not hidden from you.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	10	My heart is throbbing, my strength has failed me. The light of my eyes – even it is gone from me.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	11	My dear ones and friends keep aloof, and my neighbors stand afar off.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	12	They who aim at my life lay their snares, they who seek my hurt speak of ruin, nursing treachery all the day long.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	13	But I turn a deaf ear and hear not; like the dumb I open not my mouth.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	14	I am like one without hearing, with no arguments in my mouth.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	15	For my hope, O LORD, is in you. You will answer, O LORD  my God,	15	OEB
Psalms	38	16	when I utter the hope that those who made scorn of my tottering feet may not rejoice over me.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	17	For I am ready to fall, my pain forsakes me never.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	18	I acknowledge my guilt, I am anxious because of my sin:	15	OEB
Psalms	38	19	My wanton assailants are strong, those who wrongfully hate me are many,	15	OEB
Psalms	38	20	who render me evil for good, and oppose me, because I make good my goal.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	21	Do not forsake me, O LORD ; my God, be not far from me.	15	OEB
Psalms	38	22	Hasten to help me, O LORD  my savior.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	1	I vowed to watch my words, and sin not with my tongue, but to put on my mouth a muzzle, while the wicked were in my presence.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	2	I was silent and dumb, speechless: but my pain was stirred up.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	3	My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire was kindled, till at last the words came to my tongue.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	4	“Teach me, O LORD, my end, and the sum of my days what it is. Let me know how transient I am.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	5	See! My days you have made but a span, and my life is as nothing before you. It is but as a breath that everyone stands: *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	39	6	it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro, and all our noise is for nothing. We heap up, and know not who will gather.”	15	OEB
Psalms	39	7	And now, what wait I for, LORD ? My hope is in you.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	8	From all my transgressions deliver me; make me not the scorn of the fool.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	9	I am dumb, never opening my mouth, for this is your own doing.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	10	Remove your stroke from off me: by the might of your hand I am spent.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	11	When you rebuke someone to punish their sins, you consume, like a moth, what they treasures. Everyone is only a breath. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	39	12	Hear my prayer, O LORD ; attend to my cry for help. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am but a guest of yours, a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.	15	OEB
Psalms	39	13	Look away from me, let me smile again, before I die and am gone.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	1	For the LORD  I waited and waited, till, inclining to me, he heard my cry.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	2	From the horrible pit he drew me, up out of the miry clay; he set my feet on a rock, and my steps he made firm.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth, of praise to our God. Many see it, and, filled with awe, put their trust in the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	40	4	Happy the person who has put in the LORD  their trust, not looking to false gods or turning to idols.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	5	With us you have wrought in rich measure, O LORD  our God, your marvels and purposes for us – none may compare with you – were I to declare or to tell them, past counting are they.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	6	In offerings bloody or bloodless you have no delight, but with open ears you have made me. Burnt-offering and offering for sin are not what you ask.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	7	Then said I, “Here I am, as the roll of the book has enjoined.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	8	My delight, O God, is to do your will, and your law is within my heart.”	15	OEB
Psalms	40	9	Well, O LORD, you know that, with lips unrestrained, your righteousness I told in the great congregation,	15	OEB
Psalms	40	10	not hiding it in my heart. I have told of your steadfast help, from the great congregation I hid not your love and your faithfulness.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	11	So do not restrain, LORD, your pity from us. Your love and your faithfulness – ever may they be our shield.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	12	For evils that cannot be numbered have compassed me round. My transgressions have followed me up – I can bear it no more. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has forsaken me.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	13	O LORD, be pleased to deliver me, haste to my help, O LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	40	14	May those who are seeking my life be ashamed and confounded together; may those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonor.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	15	May those who hurrah over me be dumbfounded because of their shame.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	16	But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all those eager for your aid, say, “Great is the LORD ” evermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	40	17	I am weak and needy, yet the LORD  cares for me. You are my help and deliverer; don’t delay, my God.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	1	Happy are those who consider the weak; in the day of misfortune the LORD  will deliver them.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	2	He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land, and not give them up to the rage of their foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	3	The LORD  will sustain them on bed of languishing; tending their sickness, as long as they lie.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	4	For this cause I say, “LORD, show me your favor; heal me, because I have sinned against you.”	15	OEB
Psalms	41	5	My enemies speak of me nothing but evil, “When will he die, and his name pass away?”	15	OEB
Psalms	41	6	When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; and when they go out, they give it speech.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	7	In secret they whisper together against me, all those who hate me plot evil against me.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	8	“Some fatal disease has fastened upon him; and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.”	15	OEB
Psalms	41	9	My most trusted friend, on whom I relied, who ate of my bread, has turned against me.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	10	But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up, that I may pay them their due reward.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	11	By this will I know you delight in me: if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	12	For my innocence you uphold me, and set me forever before your face.	15	OEB
Psalms	41	13	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,* *from everlasting to everlasting,* *Amen and Amen.*	15	OEB
Psalms	42	1	Like the hart which longs for brooks of water, I long for you, God.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	2	I thirst for God, for my living God. When shall I enter in, and see the face of God?	15	OEB
Psalms	42	3	My tears have been my food by day and by night; for they say to me all the day long, “Where is your God?”	15	OEB
Psalms	42	4	My heart floods with sorrow, as I call to mind: how I used to pass on with the throng, at their head, to the house of God, with glad shouts and giving of thanks, in the throng who kept festival.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	5	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	6	I am sunk in my misery; I will therefore call you to mind from the land of Jordan and Hermon, the mountain Mizar.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	7	Flood is calling to flood at the noise of your cataracts; all your waves and your breakers have passed over me.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	8	In the day I cry to the LORD to summon his kindness; and the song that I sing in the night is a prayer to the living God.	15	OEB
Psalms	42	9	I say to God my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?”	15	OEB
Psalms	42	10	It pierces me to the heart to hear the enemy’s taunts, as all the day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”	15	OEB
Psalms	42	11	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.	15	OEB
Psalms	43	1	Right me, defend my cause against a pitiless people. From the crafty and crooked, O God, deliver me.	15	OEB
Psalms	43	2	For you are God my protector: why have you cast me off? Why must I walk so sadly, so hard pressed by the foe?	15	OEB
Psalms	43	3	Send forth your light and your truth, let them be my guides: to your holy hill let them bring me, to the place where you live.	15	OEB

Psalms	43	5	Why am I downcast? Why this moaning within me? Hope in God; for yet will I praise him, my help, my God.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	1	O God, we have heard with our ears, all our ancestors have told us of the work that you wrought in their day, your wonders in days of old,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	2	uprooting and crushing the nations, then planting and settling them. For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	3	it was not their own arm that brought them the victory. Yours was the hand and the arm, yours was the face that shone on them with favor.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	4	It was you, my king and my God, that ordained the victories of Jacob.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	5	Through you we can thrust back our foes, and by your name tread down our assailants:	15	OEB

Psalms	44	7	Our victory comes from you, and confusion to those who hate us.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	8	In God we boast all the day long, and your name will we praise forever. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	44	9	Yet you have spurned and disgraced us, in not going forth with our armies,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	10	and in making us flee from the foe, so that those who hated us plundered us.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	11	You have let us be eaten like sheep, you have scattered us over the world,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	12	sold your people for a pittance, and getting no gain from their price.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	13	You have made us the butt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of all round us.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	14	O’er the world you have made us a byword, the nations at us shake their heads.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	15	My disgrace is forever before me, my face is covered with shame,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	16	at the words of blasphemer and scoffer, at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	17	All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you nor falsely dealt with your covenant.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	18	Our heart has not turned back, nor our steps declined from your way,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	19	that you thus should have crushed us down, and covered us over with gloom, in the place where the jackals roam.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	20	Had we forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,	15	OEB
Psalms	44	21	would God not have searched this out? For he knows the heart and its secrets.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	22	But in your cause it is we are killed all the day, and counted as sheep for the slaughter.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	23	Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord? Awake, cast us not off forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	24	Why do you hide your face, forgetting our stress and our misery?	15	OEB
Psalms	44	25	For we have sunk down to the dust, our bodies cling to the ground.	15	OEB
Psalms	44	26	Arise, come to our help: for your love’s sake, ransom us.	15	OEB
Psalms	45	1	My heart is astir with beautiful words: I will sing a song, concerning the king, with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.	15	OEB
Psalms	45	2	Your beauty is more than mortal, grace is shed over your lips: therefore God has blessed you forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	45	3	Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh. What glory and splendor!	15	OEB
Psalms	45	4	Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice. May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.	15	OEB
Psalms	45	5	Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you: pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.	15	OEB
Psalms	45	6	Your throne shall endure for ever and ever your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.	15	OEB

Psalms	45	17	Your name will I celebrate world without end, so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.	15	OEB
Psalms	46	1	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.	15	OEB
Psalms	46	2	So we have no fear, though earth should change, and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.	15	OEB
Psalms	46	3	Let its waters roar and foam, let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. On our side is the LORD  of hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	46	4	A river there is, whose streams make glad God’s city, the home the Most High has hallowed.	15	OEB
Psalms	46	5	God is within her: she cannot be shaken. God helps her at the turn of the morning.	15	OEB

Psalms	47	4	he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	47	5	God is gone up with a shout, the LORD  with the sound of a trumpet.	15	OEB

Psalms	48	1	Great is the LORD  and worthy all praise in the city of our God. His holy mountain,[48:2] that rises so fair, is the joy of all the world. Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion, the city of the great king.	15	OEB
Psalms	48	3	Once God made himself known as the defence of her palaces.	15	OEB
Psalms	48	4	For see! A concert of kings passed over the frontier together.	15	OEB
Psalms	48	5	But one glance, and they were astounded; they hastened away in dismay.	15	OEB
Psalms	48	6	Trembling took hold of them there, like the pains of a woman in labor.	15	OEB
Psalms	48	7	They were shattered, as east wind shatters the giant ships in pieces.	15	OEB

Psalms	49	1	Hear this, you peoples all; attend, all you who live in the world	15	OEB
Psalms	49	2	people of low degree and high, the rich and the poor together.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	3	My mouth shall utter wisdom, the thoughts of a seeing heart.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	4	I incline my ear to a proverb, on the lyre I will open my riddle.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	5	Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune, when circled by wicked and cunning foes,	15	OEB
Psalms	49	6	who put their trust in their wealth, and boast of their boundless riches?	15	OEB
Psalms	49	7	For assuredly no one can ransom themselves, or give to God the price of their life,	15	OEB
Psalms	49	8	for the ransom of a life is costly, no payment is ever enough,	15	OEB
Psalms	49	9	to keep them alive for ever and ever, so as never to see the pit at all.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	10	But see it they will. Even wise people die, the fool and the brutish perish alike, and abandon their wealth to others.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	11	The grave is their everlasting home, the place they shall live in for ever and ever, though after their own names they called whole lands.	15	OEB

Psalms	49	14	Like sheep they descend to Sheol with Death for their shepherd; down they go straight to the grave, and their form wastes away in their home below.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	15	But God will assuredly ransom my life from the hand of Sheol; for he will receive me. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	49	16	So be not afraid when someone grows rich, when the wealth of their house increases.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	17	Not a shred of it all can they take when they die, wealth cannot follow them down.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	18	Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive, and win praise from many for faring so well,	15	OEB
Psalms	49	19	they must join their ancestors, who see the light nevermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	49	20	The wealthy are without understanding, they perish like dumb animals.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	1	The LORD  God has spoken: He summons the earth from sunrise to sunset.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	2	From Zion, perfection of beauty, God’s glory shines forth.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	3	Our God comes, he cannot keep silence, devouring fire is before him, and furious tempest around him.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	4	He summons the heavens above and the earth to judge his people.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	5	Gather to him his saints by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;	15	OEB

Psalms	50	9	Not a bullock will I take from your house, nor male goats out of your folds;	15	OEB
Psalms	50	10	for all beasts of the forest are mine, and the kine on a thousand hills.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	11	I know all the birds of the air, all that moves on the fields is mine.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	12	Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fulness are mine.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	13	Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh, or drink the blood of goats?	15	OEB
Psalms	50	14	Offer to God a thank-offering, pay the Most High your vows.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	15	Summon me in the day of distress, I will rescue you, so will you honor me.”	15	OEB
Psalms	50	16	But to the wicked God says: “What right have you to talk of my statutes, or take my covenant into your mouth	15	OEB
Psalms	50	17	while you yourself hate correction, and cast my words behind you?	15	OEB
Psalms	50	18	When you see a thief, you run with them; with adulterers you keep company.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	19	You let your mouth loose for evil, your tongue contrives deceit.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	20	You shamefully speak of your kin, and slander your own mother’s son.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	21	And because I kept silence at this, you did take me for one like yourself. But I will convict you and show you plainly.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	22	“Now you who forget God, mark this, lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.	15	OEB
Psalms	50	23	Those who bring a thank-offering honor me; but to those: who follows my way, I will show the salvation of God.”	15	OEB
Psalms	51	1	In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me, in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	2	Wash me clean of my guilt, make me pure of my sin.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	3	For well I know my transgressions, my sin is ever before me.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	4	Against you, only you, have I sinned, and done that which is wrong in your sight: you therefore are just when you speak, and clear when you utter judgment.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	5	See! In guilt was I brought to the birth, and in sin did my mother conceive me.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	6	It’s the innermost truth you desire, give me therefore true wisdom of heart.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	7	Purge me clean with hyssop, wash me whiter than snow.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	8	Fill me with joy and gladness, let the bones you have broken rejoice.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	9	Hide your face from my sins, and blot out my guilt altogether.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	10	Create me a clean heart, O God, put a new steadfast spirit within me.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	11	Cast me not forth from your presence, withdraw not your holy spirit.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	12	Give me back the joy of your help, with a willing spirit sustain me.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	13	I will teach your ways to transgressors, and sinners shall turn to you.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	14	Save me from blood, O God, and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	15	Open my lips, O LORD, and my mouth shall declare your praise.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	16	For in sacrifice you have no pleasure, in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	17	The sacrifice pleasing to God is a spirit that is broken; a heart that is crushed, O God, you will not despise.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	18	Do good in your pleasure to Zion, build the walls of Jerusalem.	15	OEB
Psalms	51	19	Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice, then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	1	Why glory in mischief, you hero? God’s kindness is all the day.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	2	Engulfing ruin you plot, your tongue like a razor sharpened, you practiser of deceit.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	3	Evil, not good, you love, and falsehood, not words of truth. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	52	4	But you love all words that devour, and a tongue that is given to deceit.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	5	But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever, grasp you and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	52	6	Smitten with awe at the sight, the righteous shall laugh at you.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	7	“Look” (they will say) “at the hero who did not make God his stronghold, but trusted in his great wealth and in the strength of his riches.”	15	OEB
Psalms	52	8	But I am like a fresh olive-tree in the house of God. I trust in the kindness of God for ever and evermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	52	9	I will render you thanks for ever for what you have done. I will tell how good you are in the presence of those who love you.	15	OEB
Psalms	53	1	Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good.	15	OEB
Psalms	53	2	From heaven God looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God.	15	OEB
Psalms	53	3	But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one.	15	OEB
Psalms	53	4	Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	53	5	Sore afraid will they be, where no fear was; when God scatters the bones of the godless people. They will be put to shame, when God rejects them.	15	OEB
Psalms	53	6	If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When God brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!	15	OEB

Psalms	54	2	Listen, O God, to my prayer, attend to the words of my mouth.	15	OEB

Psalms	54	4	But see! God is my helper, the LORD  is sustaining my life.	15	OEB
Psalms	54	5	Let their evil fall back on my foes: cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	54	6	Then will I bring you glad sacrifice, praising your gracious name;	15	OEB
Psalms	54	7	for from all distress you have saved me, and feasted my eyes on my foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	1	Listen, God, to my prayer. Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	2	Hear me, and answer; for bitter is my lament.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	3	I am wild with the noise of the foe, with the clamor of the ungodly; for they hurl disaster upon me, and attack me with fury.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	4	My heart shudders within me, terrors of deaths press on me,	15	OEB
Psalms	55	5	fear and trembling attack me, and horror wraps me round.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	6	O for the wings of a dove: I would fly away and rest.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	7	I would wander far away, find refuge in the wilderness. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	55	8	I would find myself a shelter from raging wind and tempest.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	9	Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans; for I see violence and strife in the city.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	10	By day and by night they make their rounds on the city walls, while within is crime and trouble,	15	OEB
Psalms	55	11	within is ruin. Her market-place is never free of deceit and tyranny.  ##### The Treacherous Friend #####	15	OEB
Psalms	55	12	The taunts were not those of a foe that I could have borne; the disdain was not that of an enemy I could have shunned them:	15	OEB
Psalms	55	13	but it was you, my equal, my dear and familiar friend.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	14	We used to be so close, together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	15	May death suddenly take them, may they go down to Sheol alive, for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	16	But I will call on God, the LORD  will save me.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	17	Evening and morning and noon I lament and moan. He will hear my voice;	15	OEB
Psalms	55	18	though I am attacked by many he will rescue me, unharmed from the war.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	19	God, who sits on his ancient throne will hear and will humble them, for they never change, they never fear God. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	55	20	My friend turned against me, betrayed his word.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	21	His mouth was smoother than butter, but war filled his heart. His words were softer than oil, but sharper than swords.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	22	Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never let the righteous be shaken.	15	OEB
Psalms	55	23	But you, God, will hurl them down to the deepest pit. Bloody and treacherous people will not live out half their days; but I will trust you.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	1	O God, be gracious to me, for people trample upon me, all the day righting and pressing me.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	2	All the day enemies trample me; many there be who contend with me bitterly.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	3	In the day of my terror I trust in you.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	4	In God I maintain my cause, in God I fearlessly trust. What can flesh do to me?	15	OEB
Psalms	56	5	They torture me all the day, they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,	15	OEB
Psalms	56	6	banded together in secret, watching my every step, as those who hope for my death.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	7	Pay them out for their sin, O God, hurl down the strong in your anger.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	8	You yourself count my wanderings. Put in your bottle my tears are they not in your book?	15	OEB
Psalms	56	9	Then shall my foes be turned back in the day that I call. Of this I am sure, because God is for me.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	10	In God I maintain my cause, in the LORD  I maintain my cause.	15	OEB
Psalms	56	11	In God I fearlessly trust, what can people do to me?	15	OEB
Psalms	56	12	Your vows are upon me, O God, I will render thank-offerings to you;	15	OEB
Psalms	56	13	because you have saved me from death, my feet from stumbling, to the end that I walk before God in the light of the living.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	1	Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me, for in you I take shelter. In your sheltering wings I take refuge, till ruin be over past.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	2	I cry to the Most High God, to the God who accomplishes for me.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	3	He will send me his succour from heaven, he will thrust away those who would trample me. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	57	4	In the midst of lions I lie, who devour human prey. Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharpened sword.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	5	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	6	They set a net for my feet, but in it was their own foot caught. Before me they dug a pit, but they fell into it themselves. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I would sing, I would make music;	15	OEB
Psalms	57	8	awake, my soul. Awake, harp and lyre; I would wake the dawn.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	9	I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD, and make music among the nations to you;	15	OEB
Psalms	57	10	for great to heaven is your love, and your faithfulness to the clouds.	15	OEB
Psalms	57	11	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens, and your glory o’er all the earth.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	1	Do you speak what is right, you gods? With equity judge you your people?	15	OEB
Psalms	58	2	In the land you practise iniquity – all of you; violence do you dispense with your hands.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	3	The wicked go astray from the womb liars take the wrong path from their birth.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	4	Venom have they like the venom of snakes, they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,	15	OEB
Psalms	58	5	and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer, or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	6	O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth, tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	58	7	May they melt away like running water! Like tender grass, cut down may they be!	15	OEB
Psalms	58	8	Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path, like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	9	Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots, he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	10	The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous; their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	58	11	People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded: yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”	15	OEB

Psalms	59	3	For see! They lay ambush for me, strong men are banded against me not for sin or transgression of mine, for no guilt of mine, O LORD,	15	OEB
Psalms	59	4	they run and make ready. Awake! Come forth to meet me, and see!	15	OEB
Psalms	59	5	You, O LORD  of hosts, God of Israel, awake! And punish the proud, every one; spare none of the traitors vile. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	59	6	At evening they come, and, howling like dogs, make their round in the city.	15	OEB

Psalms	73	4	For never a pang have they, their body is sound and sleek.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	5	They have no trouble like mortals, no share in human pain.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	6	So they wear their pride like a necklace, they put on the garment of wrong,	15	OEB
Psalms	73	7	their eyes stand out with fatness, their heart swells with riotous fancies.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	8	Their speech is mocking and evil, condescending and crooked their speech.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	9	They have set their mouth in the heavens, while their tongue struts about on the earth.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	10	Small wonder that people resort to them, and drink deep draughts of their lore.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	11	“How does God know?” they say, “And has the Most High any knowledge?”	15	OEB
Psalms	73	12	See! These are the godless, with wealth and ease ever increasing.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	13	Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence;	15	OEB
Psalms	73	14	for all the day long was I plagued not a morning but I was chastised.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	15	But to resolve to speak like they do would be treachery to your children.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	16	So I sought to understand it, but a wearisome task it seemed:	15	OEB
Psalms	73	17	till I entered the holy world of God and saw clearly their destiny.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	18	Yes, you set them on slippery places; down to destruction you hurl them.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	19	One moment and then what a horror of ruin! They are finished and ended in terrors.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	20	Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be, whose phantoms the waker despises.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	21	So my bitterness of mind and the pain that stabbed my heart	15	OEB
Psalms	73	22	show how dull I was and stupid just like a beast before you.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	23	But I am always with you, you have hold of my right hand.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	24	By a plan of yours you guide me and will afterward take me to glory.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in the heavens but you? And on earth there is none I desire beside you.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	26	Though flesh and heart waste away, yet God is the rock of my heart, yet God is my portion forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	27	For see! Those who are far from you must perish, you destroy all who are false to you.	15	OEB
Psalms	73	28	But I am happy when close to God; the LORD  my God I have made my refuge, that I may recount all the things you have done.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	1	Why, O God, have you spurned us forever? Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?	15	OEB
Psalms	74	2	Remember the community you purchased of old to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage, Zion, the mountain you made your home.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	3	Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete. In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	4	Like lions your enemies roared through your house, replacing our symbols by signs of their own,	15	OEB
Psalms	74	5	hacking, like woodsmen who lift axes on thickets of trees,	15	OEB
Psalms	74	6	smashing with hatchets and hammers all of its carved work together.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	7	They have set your temple on fire, to the very ground they have outraged the place where lives your name.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	8	They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.” They have burned all the houses of God in the land.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	9	No symbol of ours do we see any more: no prophet is there any more, none is with us who knows how long.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	10	How long, O God, is the foe to insult? Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?	15	OEB
Psalms	74	11	Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand, why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?	15	OEB
Psalms	74	12	Yet God is our king from the ancient days, in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	13	It was you who did cleave the sea by your might, and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	14	It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan, and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	15	It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents; it was you who did dry the perennial streams.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	16	Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night, it was you who did establish the sun and the star.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	17	It was you who did fix all the borders of earth: summer and winter it’s you who have made them.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	18	Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD, and a nation of fools has reviled your name.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	19	Do not give your dove to the beasts, do not forget your afflicted forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	20	Look to the sleek ones – how full they are: the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	21	O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed: let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	22	Arise, God, and defend your cause: remember how fools all the day insult you.	15	OEB
Psalms	74	23	Do not forget the uproar of your enemies, the din of your foes that ascends evermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	1	We praise you, God, we praise you: we would call on your name and declare your wonders.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	2	“At the time I choose, I will judge fairly.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	3	Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.” *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	75	4	I say to the boasters, “Boast not”; to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:	15	OEB
Psalms	75	5	lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.”	15	OEB
Psalms	75	6	For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains;	15	OEB
Psalms	75	7	but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	8	In the hand of the LORD  is a cup foaming wine, richly spiced. Out of this he pours a draught, and all the wicked of earth must drain it down to the dregs.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	9	But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob.	15	OEB
Psalms	75	10	I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	1	God has made himself known in Judah, his name is great in Israel.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	2	His tent is in Salem, his dwelling in Zion.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	3	There he broke the lightning arrows, shield, sword, and weapons of war. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	76	4	Terrible is your splendor on the everlasting mountains.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	5	Despoiled were the stout of heart; in the sleep into which they had fallen, none of the warriors could lift a hand.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob, sank chariot and horse to sleep.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	7	Awful are you: who can stand before you, when once you are angry?	15	OEB
Psalms	76	8	The judgment you gave from heaven frightened the earth into silence,	15	OEB
Psalms	76	9	when God arose to judgment to save the oppressed of the earth. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	76	10	The fiercest will praise you, to you will the remnant hold festival.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	11	Vow and pay to LORD  your God, and let all who are round him bring presents.	15	OEB
Psalms	76	12	He lops off the courage of princes, and with terror fills kings of the earth.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	1	Loudly will I lift my cry to God, loudly to God, so he hears to me.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD ; in the night I lift my hands in prayer, refusing all comfort.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	3	When I think of God, I moan; when I muse, my spirit is faint. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	77	4	When you hold my eyes awake, and I am restless and speechless,	15	OEB
Psalms	77	5	I think of the days of old, call to mind distant years.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	6	I commune with my heart in the night, I muse with inquiring spirit.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	7	“Will the LORD  cast us off forever, will he be gracious no more?	15	OEB
Psalms	77	8	Has his love vanished forever? Is his faithfulness utterly gone?	15	OEB
Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious, or in anger withheld his compassion?” *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	77	10	Then I said, “This it is that grieves me, that the hand of the Most High has changed.”	15	OEB
Psalms	77	11	I will think of the deeds of the LORD, and remember your wonders of old.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	12	I will muse on all you have wrought, and meditate on your deeds.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	13	Then your way, O God, was majestic: what God was great as our God?	15	OEB
Psalms	77	14	You were a God who did marvels, you did show your power to the world	15	OEB
Psalms	77	15	by your arm you rescued your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	77	16	The waters saw you, O God. The waters saw you and shivered; to their depths they trembled.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	17	Clouds poured torrents of water, thunder rolled in the sky, your arrows sped to and fro.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	18	Loud was the roll of your thunder, lightnings lit up the world. Earth quaked and trembled.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	19	In your way, LORD, through the sea, in your path through the mighty waters, your footsteps were all unseen.	15	OEB
Psalms	77	20	You did guide your folk like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	1	My people, attend to my teaching: bend your ears to the words of my mouth,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	2	as I open my mouth in a poem on the riddling story of the past.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	3	What we have heard and known, and what our ancestors have told us,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	4	we will not hide from their children. We will tell to the next generation the praises and might of the LORD, and the wonders that he has done.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	5	He set up a testimony in Jacob, a law he appointed in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to make known to their children,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	6	that the next generation should know it, that the children yet to be born should arise and tell their children;	15	OEB
Psalms	78	7	that in God they might put their confidence, and not forget God’s works; but that they might keep his commandments,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	8	and not be like their ancestors, a generation defiant and stubborn, a generation with heart unsteady, and spirit unfaithful towards God.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	9	Ephraimites, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	10	They did not keep God’s covenant, they refused to walk in his law.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done, and the wonders he had shown them.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	12	He did wonders before their ancestors in the country of Zoan in Egypt.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	13	Through the sea which he split he brought them, making waters stand up like a heap;	15	OEB
Psalms	78	14	he led them by day with a cloud, all the night with a light of fire.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	15	From the rocks which he split in the wilderness, he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	16	He brought streams out of the rock, and made water run down like rivers.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on sinning against him, they defied the Most High in the desert.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	18	They willfully challenged God, demanding the food that they longed for.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	19	“Is God able,” such was their challenge, “to spread in the desert a table?	15	OEB
Psalms	78	20	From the rock that he struck there gushed water, and torrents that overflowed; but can he also give bread, or provide his people with meat?”	15	OEB
Psalms	78	21	When the LORD  heard this, he was furious, and fire was kindled on Jacob, anger flared up against Israel.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	22	For they put no trust in God, no confidence in his help.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	23	So he summoned the clouds above; and, opening the doors of heaven,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	24	he rained manna upon them for food, and grain of heaven he gave them.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	25	Everyone ate the bread of angels; he sent them food to the full.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	26	He launched the east wind in the heavens, and guided the south by his power.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	27	He rained meat upon them like dust, winged bird like the sand of the sea.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	28	In the midst of their camp he dropped it, all around their tents.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	29	They ate and were more than filled; he had brought them the thing they desired.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	30	But the thing they desired became loathsome: while their food was still in their mouths,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	31	the wrath of God rose against them. He slew the stoutest among them, and laid low the young men of Israel.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	32	Yet for all this they sinned yet more, and refused to believe in his wonders.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days in a breath, and their years in sudden dismay.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they sought after him, they turned and sought God with diligence.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	37	Their heart was not steady with him, they were faithless to his covenant.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	38	But he is full of pity: he pardons sin and destroys not. Often he turns his anger away, without stirring his wrath at all.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	39	So he remembered that they were but flesh, breath that passes and does not return.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	40	But how often they rebelled in the desert, and caused him grief in the wilderness,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	41	tempting God again and again, provoking the Holy One of Israel.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	42	They did not remember his strength, nor the day he redeemed from the foe,	15	OEB
Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt, in the country of Zoan his wonders.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	44	He turned their canals into blood, their streams undrinkable.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	45	He sent forth flies, which devoured them; frogs, too, which destroyed them.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	46	Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, and the fruits of their toil to the locust.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	47	He slew their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	48	He delivered their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to bolts of fire.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	49	He let loose his hot anger among them, fury and wrath and distress, a band of destroying angels.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	50	He cleared a path for his anger, did not spare them from death, but gave them over to pestilence.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	51	He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	52	He led forth his people like sheep, he was guide to his flock in the desert.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	53	Securely he led them, and free from fear, while their foes were drowned in the sea.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	54	To his holy realm he brought them, to the mountain his right hand had purchased.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations before them, and allotted their land for possession, and their tents for Israel to live in.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, they did not observe his decrees.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	57	They drew back, false like their ancestors; they failed like a treacherous bow.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	58	Their shrines stirred him to anger, their idols moved him to jealousy.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	59	When God heard of this, he was furious, and he spurned Israel utterly.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	60	He abandoned his home in Shiloh, the tent he had pitched among people.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	61	He gave his strength up to captivity, his glory to the hands of the foe.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	62	He gave his people to the sword, he was furious with his own.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men, and their maidens had no marriage-song.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	65	Then the LORD  awoke as from sleep, like a warrior flushed with wine;	15	OEB
Psalms	78	66	and he beat back his foes, putting them to perpetual scorn.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	67	He disowned the tent of Joseph, he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;	15	OEB
Psalms	78	68	but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	69	And he built like the heights his sanctuary, like the earth which he founded forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	70	And he chose David his servant, taking him from the sheepfolds.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	71	From the mother-ewes he brought him, to be shepherd to Jacob his people, and to Israel his inheritance.	15	OEB
Psalms	78	72	With upright heart did he shepherd them, and with skilful hands did he guide them.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	1	Heathen, O God, have come into your land, defiling your holy temple, and laying Jerusalem in ruins.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	2	They have given the bodies of your dead servants to the birds of the air to devour, and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	3	Round about Jerusalem they have poured out their blood like water; and there was no one to bury them.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	4	On every side our neighbors revile us and mock us and jeer at us.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	5	How long will you be angry, O LORD ? Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?	15	OEB
Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	7	For Jacob they devoured, they have desolated his home.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	8	Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins; O meet us soon with your pity, for utterly weak are we.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God our savior, for the renown of your name: for your reputation deliver us and cover over our sins.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants be shown on the heathen before our eyes.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	11	May the groans of the prisoner come before you; free the children of death by your mighty arm.	15	OEB
Psalms	79	12	Pay our neighbors back sevenfold for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	79	13	Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you for evermore, and tell your praise to all generations.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	1	Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep; from your throne on the cherubs shine forth	15	OEB
Psalms	80	2	before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin. Stir up your mighty power, come to our help.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	3	God, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	4	O LORD  of hosts, how long is your anger to smoke, despite the prayer of your people?	15	OEB
Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with bread of tears, you have made them drink tears by the measure.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	6	The scorn of our neighbors you make us, the laughing-stock of our foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	7	God of hosts, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	8	A vine out of Egypt you brought; you did drive out the nations, and plant her;	15	OEB
Psalms	80	9	in the ground you did clear she struck root, and she filled all the land.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	10	The shade of her covered the mountains, her branches the cedars of God.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	11	She sent forth her shoots to the sea, and her branches as far as the River.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	12	Why have you torn down her fences, and left her to be plucked at by all who pass by,	15	OEB
Psalms	80	13	to be gnawed by the boar from the forest, and devoured by the beasts of the field?	15	OEB
Psalms	80	14	O God of hosts, return: look down from heaven and see and visit this vine, and restore her	15	OEB
Psalms	80	15	the vine which your right hand has planted.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	16	She is burned with fire and cut down before your stern face they are perishing.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	17	Support the one you have chosen, the one you have raised for yourself;	15	OEB
Psalms	80	18	then from you we will never draw back. Preserve us, and we will call on your name.	15	OEB
Psalms	80	19	LORD, God of hosts, restore us: Show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	1	Sing aloud to God our strength, shout for joy to the God of Jacob.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, sound the timbrel, sweet lyre and harp.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	3	On the new moon blow the horn, at the full moon, the day of our festival.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	4	For this is a statute for Israel, a ruling of the God of Jacob,	15	OEB
Psalms	81	5	a witness he set up in Joseph, when he marched against Egypt’s land, where he heard an unknown voice say:	15	OEB
Psalms	81	6	“I removed from your shoulder the burden, and freed your hands from the basket.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	7	At your call of distress I delivered you, from the thundercloud I answered you. At Meribah’s waters I tested you. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	81	8	“Listen, my people, to my warning, O Israel, if you would but listen!	15	OEB
Psalms	81	9	There must not be a strange god among you, you must bow to no foreign god.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	10	I am the LORD  your God who brought you up out of Egypt. Open your mouth, that I fill it.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	11	“But my people did not listen to my voice, Israel would have none of me.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	12	So to their own hard hearts I left them, to follow their own devices.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	13	O that my people would listen, that Israel would walk in my ways.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	14	Soon would I humble their enemies, and turn my hand on their foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	15	Those who hate the LORD  would cringe before him in everlasting terror.	15	OEB
Psalms	81	16	But you would I feed with the richest wheat, and with honey from the rock to your heart’s desire.”	15	OEB
Psalms	82	1	God has taken his stand in the divine assembly: in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.	15	OEB
Psalms	82	2	“How long will you crookedly judge, and favor the wicked? *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	82	3	Do right by the weak and the orphan, acquit the innocent poor.	15	OEB
Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the hand of the wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	82	5	“They have neither knowledge nor insight, in darkness they walk to and fro, while the earth’s foundations totter.	15	OEB
Psalms	82	6	It was I who appointed you gods, children of the Most High all of you.	15	OEB
Psalms	82	7	Yet like mortals you will surely die, you will fall like any prince.”	15	OEB
Psalms	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all nations are yours by inheritance.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	1	Do not keep silent, O God: hold not your peace, be not still, God.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	2	For see! Your enemies roar, those who hate you lift up their heads,	15	OEB
Psalms	83	3	laying crafty plans for your people, and plotting against those you treasure.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	4	“Come, let us wipe them out as a nation, so Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”	15	OEB
Psalms	83	5	For, conspiring with one accord, they have made a league against you	15	OEB
Psalms	83	6	Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagrites.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre;	15	OEB
Psalms	83	8	Syria, too, is confederate, they have strengthened the children of Lot. *Selah*	15	OEB
Psalms	83	9	Deal with them as you dealt with Midian, with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,	15	OEB
Psalms	83	10	who at Endor were destroyed, and became dung for the field.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,	15	OEB
Psalms	83	12	who said, “Let us take for ourselves the meadows of God.”	15	OEB
Psalms	83	13	Whirl them, my God, like dust, like stubble before the wind.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	14	As the fire that kindles the forest, as flame that sets mountains ablaze,	15	OEB
Psalms	83	15	so with your tempest pursue them, terrify them with your hurricane.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	16	Make them blush with shame; until they seek your name, O LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	83	17	Everlasting shame and confusion, disgrace and destruction be theirs.	15	OEB
Psalms	83	18	Teach those who you alone are most high over all the earth.	15	OEB

Psalms	105	10	and confirmed as a statute to Jacob, a pact everlasting to Israel	15	OEB
Psalms	105	11	to give them the land of Canaan as the lot which they should inherit.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	12	And when they were very few, few and but pilgrims therein,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	13	wandering from nation to nation, journeying from people to people,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	14	he allowed no one to oppress them, even punishing kings for their sakes.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	15	He forbade them to touch his anointed, or do any hurt to his prophets.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	16	When he called down famine on the land, and cut off the bread which sustained them,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	17	he sent before them a man, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	18	His feet were galled with fetters, he was laid in chains of iron,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	19	till the time that his word came to pass, the word of the LORD  that had tried him.	15	OEB

Psalms	105	24	His people he made very fruitful, and mightier than their foes.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	25	He inspired them to hate his people, and to deal with his servants craftily.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	26	He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron whom he had chosen,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	27	portents he wrought in Egypt, and signs in the land of Ham.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	28	Darkness he sent, and it fell: yet they gave no heed to his word.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood, thus causing their fish to die.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	30	Their land was alive with frogs, swarming even in the royal chambers.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	31	At his command came flies, and lice in all their borders.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail for rain and fire that flashed through the land,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	33	smiting their vines and figs, breaking the trees of their border.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	34	At his command came locusts, young locusts beyond all counting,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	35	which ate every herb in the land, ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	36	He struck down in their land all the firstborn, the firstlings of all their strength	15	OEB
Psalms	105	37	Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, and among his tribes no one was weary.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they left, for terror had fallen upon them.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud to screen them, and fire to give light in the night.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	40	He sent quails at their entreaty, and heavenly bread in abundance.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock; waters gushed: in the desert they ran like a river.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy promise to Abraham his servant.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	43	So he led out his people with joy, his elect with a ringing cry.	15	OEB
Psalms	105	44	And he gave them the lands of the nations, the fruit of their toil for possession,	15	OEB
Psalms	105	45	that so they might keep his statutes, and be of his laws observant. Hallelujah.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	1	Hallelujah!  Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness, for his kindness endures forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	2	Who can describe his heroic deeds, or publish all his praise?	15	OEB
Psalms	106	3	Happy they who act justly, and do righteousness evermore.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	4	Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people, and visit me with your gracious help.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	5	May I see the good fortune of your elect, may I share in the joy of your nation, and in the pride of your heritage.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	6	We, like our fathers, have sinned, we have done perversely and wickedly	15	OEB
Psalms	106	7	In the land of Egypt our fathers, all heedless of your wonders, and unmindful of your great kindness, at the Red Sea defied the Most High.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	8	But true to his name he saved them, in order to show his might.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; they marched through the depths as through desert,	15	OEB
Psalms	106	10	saved from the hand of the hostile, redeemed from the hand of the foe.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	11	The waters covered their enemies: not one of them was left.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	12	So then they believed in his words, and began to sing his praise.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	13	But soon they forgot his deeds: they did not wait for his counsel.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	14	Their greed was ravenous in the desert; they put God to the test in the wilderness.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	15	He gave them the thing they had asked for, but sent wasting disease among them.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	16	The camp grew jealous of Moses and of Aaron, holy one of the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered Abiram’s company.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	18	Fire broke out on their company, flame kindled upon the wicked.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed to the molten image.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	20	They exchanged their glorious God for the image of ox that eats grass.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	21	They forgot the God who had saved them by mighty deeds in Egypt	15	OEB
Psalms	106	22	Wonders in the land of Ham, terrors by the Red Sea.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	23	So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, but for Moses his elect, who stepped into the breach before him, to divert his deadly wrath.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	24	They spurned the delightsome land, they refused to believe in his word.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	25	They grumbled in their tents, would not listen to the voice of the LORD .	15	OEB
Psalms	106	26	So he swore with uplifted hand to lay them low in the wilderness;	15	OEB
Psalms	106	27	to disperse their seed among heathen, to scatter them over the world.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	28	Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, and ate what was offered the dead.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	29	They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, and plague broke out among them.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood between, and so the plague was stayed;	15	OEB
Psalms	106	31	and it was counted to him for righteousness unto all generations forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	32	They angered him at the waters of Meribah, through them it went ill with Moses.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	33	They rebelled against his spirit, and he uttered speech that was rash.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the nations, as the LORD  had commanded them;	15	OEB
Psalms	106	35	but they mingled with the heathen, and learned to do as they did.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	36	Their idol gods they worshipped, and they were ensnared by them.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	37	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	38	They poured out innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they offered to Canaan’s idols, and the land was polluted with blood.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	39	They became unclean by their works, and adulterous in their deeds.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	40	Then the LORD ’s fury was on his people, filled with horror at his inheritance.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	41	He delivered them to the heathen, to the sway of those who hated them.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	43	Many a time he saved them, but they rebelled at his counsel, and were brought low by their wrongdoing.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	44	Yet he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	45	He remembered his covenant, and, in his great kindness, relented.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	46	He caused them to be pitied by all who carried them captive.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	47	Save us, O LORD  our God, and gather us out of the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, and to make our boast of your praise.	15	OEB
Psalms	106	48	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,* *from everlasting to everlasting.* *And let all the people say “Amen.”* *Praise the LORD .*	15	OEB
Psalms	107	1	Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness for his kindness endures forever.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	2	Let this be the song of the ransomed, whom the LORD  has redeemed from distress,	15	OEB
Psalms	107	3	gathering them from all lands, east, west, north, and south.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	4	In the wastes of the desert some wandered, finding no way to a city inhabited.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	5	Full of hunger and thirst, their spirit failed.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	6	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses,	15	OEB
Psalms	107	7	guiding them straight on the way, till they reached an inhabited city.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	8	Let them thank the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people;	15	OEB
Psalms	107	9	for the thirsty he satisfies, and the hungry he fills with good things.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness and gloom prisoners in irons and misery,	15	OEB
Psalms	107	11	for rebelling against God’s word, and spurning the Most High’s counsel.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	12	Their heart was bowed with toil; there was no one to help when they stumbled.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	14	Out of darkness and gloom he brought them, and burst their chains.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	15	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	16	For he shattered the gates of bronze, and broke bars of iron.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	17	Some were sick from their wicked ways, and suffering because of their sins.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	18	All manner of food they hated; they had come to the gates of death.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	19	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	20	He sent his word and healed them, and delivered their life from the pit.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	21	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	22	Let them offer to him thankofferings, and with joy tell what things he has done.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	23	Some crossed the sea in ships, doing business in great waters.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	24	They have seen what the LORD  can do, and his wonderful deeds on the deep.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	25	At his command rose a tempest, which lifted the waves on high.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	26	Up to heaven they went, down to the depths; their courage failed them.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	27	They staggered and reeled like drunkards; all their skills useless.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	28	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	29	He stilled the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	30	They were glad, because it was quiet; they were led to the haven they longed for.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	31	Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness, for his wonderful deeds for people.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	32	Where the people assemble, extol him, and praise him in council of elders.	15	OEB
Psalms	107	33	He turns streams into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty land,	15	OEB

Romans	1	1	From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.	16	OEB
Romans	1	2	This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,	16	OEB
Romans	1	3	concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,	16	OEB
Romans	1	4	but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.	16	OEB
Romans	1	5	Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.	16	OEB
Romans	1	6	And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.	16	OEB
Romans	1	7	To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	16	OEB
Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.	16	OEB
Romans	1	9	God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,	16	OEB
Romans	1	10	asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.	16	OEB
Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –	16	OEB
Romans	1	12	or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.	16	OEB
Romans	1	13	I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.	16	OEB
Romans	1	14	I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.	16	OEB
Romans	1	15	And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.	16	OEB
Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.	16	OEB
Romans	1	17	For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’	16	OEB
Romans	1	18	So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.	16	OEB
Romans	1	19	This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.	16	OEB
Romans	1	20	For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;	16	OEB
Romans	1	21	because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.	16	OEB
Romans	1	22	Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;	16	OEB
Romans	1	23	and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.	16	OEB
Romans	1	24	Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;	16	OEB
Romans	1	25	for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.	16	OEB
Romans	1	26	That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;	16	OEB
Romans	1	27	while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.	16	OEB
Romans	1	28	Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.	16	OEB
Romans	1	29	They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.	16	OEB
Romans	1	30	They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.	16	OEB
Romans	1	31	They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.	16	OEB
Romans	1	32	Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.	16	OEB
Romans	2	1	Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.	16	OEB
Romans	2	2	And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.	16	OEB
Romans	2	3	You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?	16	OEB
Romans	2	4	Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?	16	OEB
Romans	2	5	Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;	16	OEB
Romans	2	6	for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.	16	OEB
Romans	2	7	To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;	16	OEB
Romans	2	8	while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,	16	OEB
Romans	2	9	will fall on every human being who persists in wrongdoing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.	16	OEB
Romans	2	10	But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,	16	OEB
Romans	2	11	since God shows no partiality.	16	OEB
Romans	2	12	All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.	16	OEB
Romans	2	13	It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.	16	OEB
Romans	2	14	When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;	16	OEB
Romans	2	15	for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense –	16	OEB
Romans	2	16	on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.	16	OEB
Romans	2	17	But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,	16	OEB
Romans	2	18	and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.	16	OEB
Romans	2	19	Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,	16	OEB
Romans	2	20	and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.	16	OEB
Romans	2	21	Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?	16	OEB
Romans	2	22	Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?	16	OEB
Romans	2	23	Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?	16	OEB
Romans	2	24	For, as scripture says – ‘The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you’!	16	OEB
Romans	2	25	Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.	16	OEB
Romans	2	26	If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?	16	OEB
Romans	2	27	Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.	16	OEB
Romans	2	28	For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;	16	OEB
Romans	2	29	and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.	16	OEB
Romans	3	1	What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?	16	OEB
Romans	3	2	Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.	16	OEB
Romans	3	3	What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!	16	OEB
Romans	3	4	God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’	16	OEB
Romans	3	5	But what if our wrongdoing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!	16	OEB
Romans	3	6	Otherwise how can God judge the world?	16	OEB
Romans	3	7	But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?	16	OEB
Romans	3	8	Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!	16	OEB
Romans	3	9	What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.	16	OEB
Romans	3	10	As scripture says –	16	OEB
Romans	3	11	not one who understands,	16	OEB
Romans	3	12	They have all gone astray;	16	OEB
Romans	3	13	‘Their throats are like opened graves;	16	OEB
Romans	3	14	‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’	16	OEB
Romans	3	15	‘Swift are their feet to shed blood.	16	OEB
Romans	3	16	Distress and trouble dog their steps,	16	OEB
Romans	3	17	and the path of peace they do not know.’	16	OEB
Romans	3	18	‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’	16	OEB
Romans	3	19	Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.	16	OEB
Romans	3	20	For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.	16	OEB
Romans	3	21	But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –	16	OEB
Romans	3	22	the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.	16	OEB
Romans	3	23	For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,	16	OEB
Romans	3	24	but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.	16	OEB
Romans	3	25	For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;	16	OEB
Romans	3	26	as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.	16	OEB
Romans	3	27	What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.	16	OEB
Romans	3	28	For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.	16	OEB
Romans	3	29	Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?	16	OEB
Romans	3	30	Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.	16	OEB
Romans	3	31	Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law.	16	OEB
Romans	4	1	What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?	16	OEB
Romans	4	2	If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.	16	OEB
Romans	4	3	For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’	16	OEB
Romans	4	4	Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;	16	OEB
Romans	4	5	while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	4	6	In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –	16	OEB
Romans	4	7	‘Blessed are those whose wrongdoings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!	16	OEB
Romans	4	8	Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’	16	OEB
Romans	4	9	Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’	16	OEB
Romans	4	10	Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?	16	OEB
Romans	4	11	Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;	16	OEB
Romans	4	12	as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.	16	OEB
Romans	4	13	For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.	16	OEB
Romans	4	14	If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!	16	OEB
Romans	4	15	Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.	16	OEB
Romans	4	16	That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all;	16	OEB
Romans	4	17	as scripture says – ‘I have made you the father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.	16	OEB
Romans	4	18	With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words – ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the father of many nations.’	16	OEB
Romans	4	19	Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.	16	OEB
Romans	4	20	He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.	16	OEB
Romans	4	21	On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.	16	OEB
Romans	4	22	And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’	16	OEB
Romans	4	23	Now these words – ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ – were not written with reference to Abraham only;	16	OEB
Romans	4	24	but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;	16	OEB
Romans	4	25	for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offenses, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.	16	OEB
Romans	5	1	Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	5	2	It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.	16	OEB
Romans	5	3	And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;	16	OEB
Romans	5	4	for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,	16	OEB
Romans	5	5	and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;	16	OEB
Romans	5	6	seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.	16	OEB
Romans	5	7	Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.	16	OEB
Romans	5	8	But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.	16	OEB
Romans	5	9	Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.	16	OEB
Romans	5	10	For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.	16	OEB
Romans	5	11	And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.	16	OEB
Romans	5	12	Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.	16	OEB
Romans	5	13	Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.	16	OEB
Romans	5	14	Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the one to come.	16	OEB
Romans	5	15	But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.	16	OEB
Romans	5	16	There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	5	17	For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.	16	OEB
Romans	5	18	Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.	16	OEB
Romans	5	19	For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.	16	OEB
Romans	5	20	Law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,	16	OEB
Romans	5	21	in order that, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	6	1	What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?	16	OEB
Romans	6	2	Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, so how can we go on living in it?	16	OEB
Romans	6	3	Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?	16	OEB
Romans	6	4	Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.	16	OEB
Romans	6	5	If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.	16	OEB
Romans	6	6	We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.	16	OEB
Romans	6	7	For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.	16	OEB
Romans	6	8	And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.	16	OEB
Romans	6	9	We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.	16	OEB
Romans	6	10	For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.	16	OEB
Romans	6	11	So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.	16	OEB
Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.	16	OEB
Romans	6	13	Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	6	14	For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.	16	OEB
Romans	6	15	What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid!	16	OEB
Romans	6	16	Surely you know that when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service to sin which leads to death, or a service to duty which leads to righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	6	17	God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.	16	OEB
Romans	6	18	Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	6	19	I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.	16	OEB
Romans	6	20	While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	6	21	But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.	16	OEB
Romans	6	22	But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.	16	OEB
Romans	6	23	The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	7	1	Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.	16	OEB
Romans	7	2	For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.	16	OEB
Romans	7	3	If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.	16	OEB
Romans	7	4	And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.	16	OEB
Romans	7	5	When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.	16	OEB
Romans	7	6	But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.	16	OEB
Romans	7	7	What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.	16	OEB
Romans	7	8	But sin took advantage of the commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.	16	OEB
Romans	7	9	There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!	16	OEB
Romans	7	10	The commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!	16	OEB
Romans	7	11	Sin took advantage of the commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.	16	OEB
Romans	7	12	And so the Law is holy, and each commandment is also holy, and just, and good.	16	OEB
Romans	7	13	Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.	16	OEB
Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.	16	OEB
Romans	7	15	I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.	16	OEB
Romans	7	16	But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.	16	OEB
Romans	7	17	This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.	16	OEB
Romans	7	18	I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.	16	OEB
Romans	7	19	I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.	16	OEB
Romans	7	20	But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.	16	OEB
Romans	7	21	This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!	16	OEB
Romans	7	22	At heart I delight in the Law of God;	16	OEB
Romans	7	23	but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.	16	OEB
Romans	7	24	Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?	16	OEB
Romans	7	25	Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.	16	OEB
Romans	8	1	There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;	16	OEB
Romans	8	2	for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.	16	OEB
Romans	8	3	What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,	16	OEB
Romans	8	4	so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.	16	OEB
Romans	8	5	They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.	16	OEB
Romans	8	6	To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;	16	OEB
Romans	8	7	because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.	16	OEB
Romans	8	8	They who are earthly cannot please God.	16	OEB
Romans	8	9	You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;	16	OEB
Romans	8	10	but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	8	11	And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.	16	OEB
Romans	8	12	So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.	16	OEB
Romans	8	13	If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.	16	OEB
Romans	8	14	All who are guided by the Spirit of God are children of God.	16	OEB
Romans	8	15	For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a child by adoption, which leads us to cry ‘Abba, our Father.’	16	OEB
Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,	16	OEB
Romans	8	17	and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.	16	OEB
Romans	8	18	I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.	16	OEB
Romans	8	19	All nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.	16	OEB
Romans	8	20	For nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –	16	OEB
Romans	8	21	yet not without the hope that some day nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.	16	OEB
Romans	8	22	We know, indeed, that all nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.	16	OEB
Romans	8	23	And not nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.	16	OEB
Romans	8	24	By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?	16	OEB
Romans	8	25	But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.	16	OEB
Romans	8	26	So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.	16	OEB
Romans	8	27	Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.	16	OEB
Romans	8	28	But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.	16	OEB
Romans	8	29	For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.	16	OEB
Romans	8	30	And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory.	16	OEB
Romans	8	31	What are we to say, then, in the light of all this?	16	OEB
Romans	8	32	God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?	16	OEB
Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God!	16	OEB
Romans	8	34	Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf!	16	OEB
Romans	8	35	Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?	16	OEB
Romans	8	36	Scripture says – ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’	16	OEB
Romans	8	37	Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us!	16	OEB
Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,	16	OEB
Romans	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!	16	OEB
Romans	9	1	I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,	16	OEB
Romans	9	2	bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.	16	OEB
Romans	9	3	I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.	16	OEB
Romans	9	4	For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as children, the visible presence, the covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the promises.	16	OEB
Romans	9	5	They are descended from the patriarchs, and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.	16	OEB
Romans	9	6	Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;	16	OEB
Romans	9	7	nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	8	This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.	16	OEB
Romans	9	9	For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	10	Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.	16	OEB
Romans	9	11	For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,	16	OEB
Romans	9	12	that the elder would be a servant to the younger.	16	OEB
Romans	9	13	The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	14	What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!	16	OEB
Romans	9	15	For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	16	So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.	16	OEB
Romans	9	17	In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	18	So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.	16	OEB
Romans	9	19	Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?’	16	OEB
Romans	9	20	I might rather ask ‘Who are you who are arguing with God?’ Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it ‘Why did you make me like this?’	16	OEB
Romans	9	21	Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?	16	OEB
Romans	9	22	And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,	16	OEB
Romans	9	23	so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,	16	OEB
Romans	9	24	and whom he called – even us – not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also!	16	OEB
Romans	9	25	This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – ‘Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.	16	OEB
Romans	9	26	And in the place where it was said to them – “You are not my people”, they will be called sons of the living God.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – ‘Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape!	16	OEB
Romans	9	28	For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah foretold – ‘Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.’	16	OEB
Romans	9	30	What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;	16	OEB
Romans	9	31	while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.	16	OEB
Romans	9	32	And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.	16	OEB
Romans	9	33	As scripture says – ‘See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.’	16	OEB
Romans	10	1	My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.	16	OEB
Romans	10	2	I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,	16	OEB
Romans	10	3	for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.	16	OEB
Romans	10	4	For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.	16	OEB
Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.	16	OEB
Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ (which means to bring Christ down)	16	OEB
Romans	10	7	‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).	16	OEB
Romans	10	8	No, but what does it say? ‘The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart’ (which means ‘The message of faith’ which we proclaim).	16	OEB
Romans	10	9	For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.	16	OEB
Romans	10	10	For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their profession of faith and so find salvation.	16	OEB
Romans	10	11	As the passage of scripture says – ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’	16	OEB
Romans	10	12	For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.	16	OEB
Romans	10	13	For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.	16	OEB
Romans	10	14	But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?	16	OEB
Romans	10	15	And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’	16	OEB
Romans	10	16	Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’	16	OEB
Romans	10	17	And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.	16	OEB
Romans	10	18	But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for – ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’	16	OEB
Romans	10	19	But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand?’ First there is Moses, who says – ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’	16	OEB
Romans	10	20	And Isaiah says boldly – ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.’	16	OEB
Romans	10	21	But of the people of Israel he says – ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	1	I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	16	OEB
Romans	11	2	God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?	16	OEB
Romans	11	3	‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	4	But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	5	And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.	16	OEB
Romans	11	6	But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.	16	OEB
Romans	11	7	What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.	16	OEB
Romans	11	8	The rest grew callous; as scripture says – ‘God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	9	David, too, says – ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;	16	OEB
Romans	11	10	may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	11	I ask then – ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.	16	OEB
Romans	11	12	And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!	16	OEB
Romans	11	13	But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.	16	OEB
Romans	11	14	Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.	16	OEB
Romans	11	15	For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?	16	OEB
Romans	11	16	If the first handful of dough is holy, so is the whole mass, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.	16	OEB
Romans	11	17	Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.	16	OEB
Romans	11	18	Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.	16	OEB
Romans	11	19	But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.	16	OEB
Romans	11	20	True, it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.	16	OEB
Romans	11	21	For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.	16	OEB
Romans	11	22	See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.	16	OEB
Romans	11	23	And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.	16	OEB
Romans	11	24	If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree.	16	OEB
Romans	11	25	My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognize the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.	16	OEB
Romans	11	26	And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.	16	OEB
Romans	11	27	And they will see the fulfillment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.’	16	OEB
Romans	11	28	From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the patriarchs.	16	OEB
Romans	11	29	For God never regrets his gifts or his call.	16	OEB
Romans	11	30	Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;	16	OEB
Romans	11	31	so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.	16	OEB
Romans	11	32	For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.	16	OEB
Romans	11	33	Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –	16	OEB
Romans	11	34	ho has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?	16	OEB
Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?	16	OEB
Romans	11	36	For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.	16	OEB
Romans	12	1	I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.	16	OEB
Romans	12	2	Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.	16	OEB
Romans	12	3	In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of themselves than they ought to think, but to think until they learn to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.	16	OEB
Romans	12	4	For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,	16	OEB
Romans	12	5	so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.	16	OEB
Romans	12	6	Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;	16	OEB
Romans	12	7	if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,	16	OEB
Romans	12	8	the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.	16	OEB
Romans	12	9	Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.	16	OEB
Romans	12	10	In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;	16	OEB
Romans	12	11	never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;	16	OEB
Romans	12	12	rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;	16	OEB
Romans	12	13	relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.	16	OEB
Romans	12	14	Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.	16	OEB
Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.	16	OEB
Romans	12	16	Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.	16	OEB
Romans	12	17	Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.	16	OEB
Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.	16	OEB
Romans	12	19	Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’	16	OEB
Romans	12	20	Rather – ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’	16	OEB
Romans	12	21	Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.	16	OEB
Romans	13	1	Let everyone obey the supreme authorities. For no authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing authorities have been appointed by God.	16	OEB
Romans	13	2	Therefore the one who sets themself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.	16	OEB
Romans	13	3	A good action has nothing to fear from rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.	16	OEB
Romans	13	4	For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.	16	OEB
Romans	13	5	You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.	16	OEB
Romans	13	6	This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.	16	OEB
Romans	13	7	In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due.	16	OEB
Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the Law.	16	OEB
Romans	13	9	The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, you must not kill, you must not steal, you must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’	16	OEB
Romans	13	10	Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.	16	OEB
Romans	13	11	This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.	16	OEB
Romans	13	12	The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us be done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.	16	OEB
Romans	13	13	Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.	16	OEB
Romans	13	14	No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.	16	OEB
Romans	14	1	As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.	16	OEB
Romans	14	2	One person’s faith permits them to eat food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.	16	OEB
Romans	14	3	The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.	16	OEB
Romans	14	4	Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.	16	OEB
Romans	14	5	Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.	16	OEB
Romans	14	6	The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.	16	OEB
Romans	14	7	There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;	16	OEB
Romans	14	8	for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.	16	OEB
Romans	14	9	The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.	16	OEB
Romans	14	10	I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.	16	OEB
Romans	14	11	For scripture says – ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.”’	16	OEB
Romans	14	12	So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.	16	OEB
Romans	14	13	Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	14	14	Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.	16	OEB
Romans	14	15	If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!	16	OEB
Romans	14	16	Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.	16	OEB
Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.	16	OEB
Romans	14	18	The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.	16	OEB
Romans	14	19	Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.	16	OEB
Romans	14	20	Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.	16	OEB
Romans	14	21	The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	14	22	As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!	16	OEB
Romans	14	23	The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.	16	OEB
Romans	15	1	We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.	16	OEB
Romans	15	2	Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.	16	OEB
Romans	15	3	Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’	16	OEB
Romans	15	4	Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.	16	OEB
Romans	15	5	And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,	16	OEB
Romans	15	6	so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.	16	OEB
Romans	15	7	Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.	16	OEB
Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,	16	OEB
Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’	16	OEB
Romans	15	10	And again it says – ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’	16	OEB
Romans	15	11	And yet again – ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’	16	OEB
Romans	15	12	Again, Isaiah says – ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’	16	OEB
Romans	15	13	May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.	16	OEB
Romans	15	14	I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.	16	OEB
Romans	15	15	But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –	16	OEB
Romans	15	16	because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.	16	OEB
Romans	15	17	It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.	16	OEB
Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –	16	OEB
Romans	15	19	by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;	16	OEB
Romans	15	20	yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.	16	OEB
Romans	15	21	But as scripture says – ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’	16	OEB
Romans	15	22	That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.	16	OEB
Romans	15	23	But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.	16	OEB
Romans	15	24	For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.	16	OEB
Romans	15	25	Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.	16	OEB
Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.	16	OEB
Romans	15	27	Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.	16	OEB
Romans	15	28	When I have settled this matter, and have secured for the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.	16	OEB
Romans	15	29	And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.	16	OEB
Romans	15	30	I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.	16	OEB
Romans	15	31	Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;	16	OEB
Romans	15	32	so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.	16	OEB
Romans	15	33	May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.	16	OEB
Romans	16	1	I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is a minister of the church at Cenchreae;	16	OEB
Romans	16	2	and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others.	16	OEB
Romans	16	3	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,	16	OEB
Romans	16	4	who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.	16	OEB
Romans	16	5	Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;	16	OEB
Romans	16	6	to Mary, who worked hard for you;	16	OEB
Romans	16	7	to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;	16	OEB
Romans	16	8	to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus;	16	OEB
Romans	16	9	to Urban, our fellow worker in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys;	16	OEB
Romans	16	10	to that tried and true Christian Apelles; to the household of Aristobulus;	16	OEB
Romans	16	11	to my countryman Herodion; to the Christians in the household of Narcissus;	16	OEB
Romans	16	12	to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master;	16	OEB
Romans	16	13	to that eminent Christian, Rufus, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me also;	16	OEB
Romans	16	14	to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and our friends with them;	16	OEB
Romans	16	15	also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all Christ’s people who are with them.	16	OEB
Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.	16	OEB
Romans	16	17	I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them.	16	OEB
Romans	16	18	For such persons are not serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and, by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.	16	OEB
Romans	16	19	Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good, and innocent of all that is bad.	16	OEB
Romans	16	20	And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet.	16	OEB
Romans	16	21	Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, send theirs.	16	OEB
Romans	16	22	I Tertius, who am writing this letter, send you my Christian greeting.	16	OEB
Romans	16	23	My host Gaius, who extends his hospitality to the whole church, sends you his greeting; and Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus, our dear friend, add theirs.	16	OEB
Romans	16	24	^[ 16:24 Some later manuscripts add: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]	16	OEB
Romans	16	25	Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past ages was kept secret but now has been revealed	16	OEB
Romans	16	26	and, in obedience to the command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith –	16	OEB
Romans	16	27	to him, I say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory for ever and ever. Amen.	16	OEB
Ruth	1	1	In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	2	His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,	17	OEB
Ruth	1	3	Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,	17	OEB
Ruth	1	4	who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,	17	OEB
Ruth	1	5	Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	6	So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the LORD  had remembered his people and given them food.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	7	As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,	17	OEB
Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the LORD  be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	9	The LORD  grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	10	and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?	17	OEB
Ruth	1	12	Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,	17	OEB
Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the LORD  has sent me adversity.”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	14	Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	15	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	16	But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;	17	OEB
Ruth	1	17	I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the LORD  bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	19	So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	20	“Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara^[ 1:20 In Hebrew “Naomi” means “pleasant,” and “Mara” means “bitter.”], for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.	17	OEB
Ruth	1	21	I had plenty when I left, but the LORD  has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the LORD  has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?”	17	OEB
Ruth	1	22	So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	1	Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	3	So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	4	When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The LORD  be with you,” they answered him, “May the LORD  bless you.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	5	“Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	6	The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	7	She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	9	Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	10	Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	11	Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	12	May the LORD  repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	13	Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	15	When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	18	Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.	17	OEB
Ruth	2	19	“Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the LORD  rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	21	“He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.”	17	OEB
Ruth	2	23	So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	1	One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?	17	OEB
Ruth	3	2	Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?	17	OEB
Ruth	3	3	Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	4	Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.”	17	OEB
Ruth	3	5	“I will do as you say.” Ruth said to her.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	8	At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!	17	OEB
Ruth	3	9	“Who are you?” he said. “I am Ruth your servant,” she answered, “Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.”	17	OEB
Ruth	3	10	He said, “May you be blest by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	11	My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	13	Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the LORD  lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.”	17	OEB
Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognize her, for Boaz said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.”	17	OEB
Ruth	3	15	He also said, “Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.” So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	16	When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “Is it you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.	17	OEB
Ruth	3	17	“He gave me these six measures of barley,” she said, “for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.”	17	OEB
Ruth	3	18	“Wait quietly, my daughter.” Naomi said, “Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	1	Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, “Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.” So he stopped and sat down.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	2	Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the near relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,	17	OEB
Ruth	4	4	and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	6	“I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,” the near relative said. “You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	7	Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	8	So when the near relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	10	Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	11	Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD  make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	12	From the children whom the LORD  will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	13	So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the LORD  gave to her a son.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD  who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	15	This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!”	17	OEB
Ruth	4	16	So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	17	The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.	17	OEB
Ruth	4	18	This is the genealogy of Perez:	17	OEB
Ruth	4	19	Hezron of Ram,	17	OEB
Ruth	4	20	Amminidab of Nashon,	17	OEB
Ruth	4	21	Salmon of Boaz,	17	OEB
Ruth	4	22	Obed of Jesse,	17	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	1	To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	4	who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	5	It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	6	If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	7	and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	8	We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	9	Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	10	And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	11	And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	12	Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	13	We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	14	And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	15	With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	16	To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	17	As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	18	As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	19	The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	20	For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	21	God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	22	also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	23	But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	1	24	I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	1	For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	2	If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	3	So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	4	I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	5	Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	6	The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	7	so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	8	So I entreat you to assure him of your love.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	9	I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	10	Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	11	so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	12	When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	13	I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	14	All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	16	To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	2	17	Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	2	You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	3	All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	4	This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	5	I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	6	our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	7	If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	8	will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	9	For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	10	Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	11	And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	12	With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	13	unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	15	But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	16	Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	17	And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	3	18	And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	2	No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	3	And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	4	people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	5	(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	6	Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	7	This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	8	Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	9	though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	10	We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	11	Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	12	And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	13	But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	14	For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	15	For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	17	The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us a weight of imperishable glory, beyond all measure.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	4	18	We, all the while, gaze not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	2	Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	3	sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found naked.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	4	For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	5	And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	7	For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	8	And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	10	For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	11	Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	12	We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	13	For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	14	It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	15	and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	16	For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	18	But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	19	To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	20	It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	5	21	For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	1	Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	2	For he says –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	3	Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	4	No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	5	in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in hunger;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	6	by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	7	by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	8	amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	9	as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	10	as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	11	We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	12	there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	13	Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	14	Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	16	What agreement can there be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	17	Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	6	18	and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,”	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	1	With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	3	I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	4	I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	5	Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	6	But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	7	And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	8	For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	9	I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	10	For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	11	For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	12	So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	13	In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	14	Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	7	16	I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	1	We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	2	How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	3	I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	4	and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	5	And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	6	And this led us to beg Titus, that since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	7	And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	8	I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	9	For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	10	I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	11	And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	12	For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	13	For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	14	On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	15	As scripture says –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	16	I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	17	for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	18	We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	19	and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honor of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	20	What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	21	for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	22	We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	23	If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	8	24	Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	1	With reference, indeed, to the fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	2	I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	3	So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	4	Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	6	Remember the saying – ‘Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.’	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	7	Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	8	God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	9	(As scripture says –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	10	And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	11	Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	12	For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	13	Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	14	And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	9	15	All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	1	Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	2	I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	3	For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	4	The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	5	We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	6	and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	7	You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	8	Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	9	I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	10	For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	12	We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	13	We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	14	For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	15	Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	16	So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	17	Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	10	18	For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	1	I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	2	I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I promised you in marriage as a pure bride, to one husband – the Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	3	Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	4	For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	5	I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	6	Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	7	Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	9	And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	10	As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	12	What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	13	Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	15	It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	16	I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	17	When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	18	As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	19	For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	20	You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	21	I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	26	My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	27	I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	28	And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	32	When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	11	33	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	1	I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	3	And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	4	Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	5	About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	6	Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	7	It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	8	About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	9	But his reply has been –  ‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	10	That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	11	I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	12	The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	13	In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	14	Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	15	For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	16	You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	17	Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	19	Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	20	for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	1	For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	2	I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	3	And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	4	For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	5	Put yourselves to the test, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Examine yourselves. Surely you recognize this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	6	But I hope that you will recognize that we can stand the test.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	7	We pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	8	We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	9	We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	10	This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	11	And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a sacred kiss.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	13	All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.	18	OEB
2 Corinthians	13	14	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.	18	OEB
2 John	1	1	From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well.	19	OEB
2 John	1	2	We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever.	19	OEB
2 John	1	3	Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours – the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son – in truth and love.	19	OEB
2 John	1	4	It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.	19	OEB
2 John	1	5	And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. – Let us love one another.	19	OEB
2 John	1	6	And this is love – to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love.	19	OEB
2 John	1	7	I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world – men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist.	19	OEB
2 John	1	8	Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward.	19	OEB
2 John	1	9	Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching – they have both the Father and the Son.	19	OEB
2 John	1	10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them;	19	OEB
2 John	1	11	because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work.	19	OEB
2 John	1	12	Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.	19	OEB
2 John	1	13	The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.	19	OEB
2 Peter	1	1	To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	2	May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	3	For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	4	For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	5	Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	6	knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	7	piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	8	For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	9	Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	11	For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	12	I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	13	But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this ‘tent,’ to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	14	for I know that the time for this ‘tent’ of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	15	So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	16	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	17	For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	18	These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	19	And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	20	But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;	20	OEB
2 Peter	1	21	for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	1	But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	2	There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	3	In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	4	Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	5	Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	6	He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	7	but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbors;	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	8	for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	9	The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for ‘the day of judgment’ –	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	10	especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	11	even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	12	These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	13	suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	14	They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	15	Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrongdoing,	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	16	but was rebuked for his offense. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	17	These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	18	With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	19	They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	20	If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	21	It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.	20	OEB
2 Peter	2	22	In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – ‘A dog returns to what it has vomited’ and ‘A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.’	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	1	This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	2	I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Savior given to you through your apostles.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	3	First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	4	will come and ask scoffingly – ‘Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!’	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	5	For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	6	and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	7	But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	8	But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	10	The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	11	Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	12	while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon^[ 3:12 Or: and desire its coming.]. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	13	but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	15	Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	16	It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	17	You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;	20	OEB
2 Peter	3	18	and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.	20	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	1	To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	2	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	3	Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	4	So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	5	These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	6	since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	8	Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	9	They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin – banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	10	when he comes to be honored in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) – as he will be on that day.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	11	With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	1	12	Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honored in you, and you in him.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	1	As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	2	not lightly to let your minds become unsettled or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message or letter purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	3	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. For it will not come before the final rebellion against God, when lawlessness is revealed in human form, headed for destruction.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	4	He is the adversary of everything that is spoken of as a god or as an object of worship, enthroning himself in God’s Temple claiming to be God!	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	5	Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	6	And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	7	Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret, but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless person will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth, annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	9	When the lawless person comes, there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	10	to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	11	That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	12	so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	13	But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	14	To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	15	Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	16	And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	2	17	console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	1	In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	4	Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	6	We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	9	This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	10	Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	12	All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	13	You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	14	If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	15	Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	16	May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	17	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.	21	OEB
2 Thessalonians	3	18	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.	21	OEB
2 Timothy	1	1	From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	3	I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	4	as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	5	now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	6	And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	7	For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	8	Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	9	It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	10	and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and immortality to light by that good news,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	11	of which I was myself appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	12	That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	13	Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	14	Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	15	You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	17	On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	1	You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	2	and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	3	Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	4	A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	5	No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	6	The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	7	Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	8	Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	9	in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	10	and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	11	How true this saying is – ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	12	If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	13	If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	14	Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	15	Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	16	Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	17	and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	18	They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	19	Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription –	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	21	If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	22	Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	23	Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	24	and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	25	They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	2	26	and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	1	Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	2	People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	3	incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	4	treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	5	and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	6	For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	7	are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	9	They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	10	But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	11	as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	12	Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	13	but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	14	You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	15	and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	16	All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;	22	OEB
2 Timothy	3	17	so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	1	I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	2	Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	3	For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	4	They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	5	But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	6	As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	7	I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	8	And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	9	Do your utmost to come to me soon,	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	10	for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	11	There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	12	I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	13	Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	15	You must also be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	16	At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	19	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	21	Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers.	22	OEB
2 Timothy	4	22	May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.	22	OEB
3 John	1	1	From the elder to his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves.	23	OEB
3 John	1	2	Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health – I know that all is well with your soul.	23	OEB
3 John	1	3	For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.	23	OEB
3 John	1	4	Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.	23	OEB
3 John	1	5	Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other followers – even when they are strangers to you.	23	OEB
3 John	1	6	They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.	23	OEB
3 John	1	7	For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.	23	OEB
3 John	1	8	Therefore, we should support people like them, and so take our share in their work for the truth.	23	OEB
3 John	1	9	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be the leader among them) doesn’t welcome us.	23	OEB
3 John	1	10	So if I come, I will bring up his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that, he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers, but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church.	23	OEB
3 John	1	11	Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.	23	OEB
3 John	1	12	Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say is true.	23	OEB
3 John	1	13	I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and ink.	23	OEB
3 John	1	14	I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face.	23	OEB
3 John	1	15	Peace be with you. The friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one of our friends.	23	OEB
Titus	1	1	From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness	24	OEB
Titus	1	2	– and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,	24	OEB
Titus	1	3	and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.	24	OEB
Titus	1	4	To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace.	24	OEB
Titus	1	5	My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.	24	OEB
Titus	1	6	They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.	24	OEB
Titus	1	7	For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.	24	OEB
Titus	1	8	Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,	24	OEB
Titus	1	9	holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.	24	OEB
Titus	1	10	For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.	24	OEB
Titus	1	11	They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.	24	OEB
Titus	1	12	It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true.	24	OEB
Titus	1	13	Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,	24	OEB
Titus	1	14	and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.	24	OEB
Titus	1	15	To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.	24	OEB
Titus	1	16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.	24	OEB
Titus	2	1	You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.	24	OEB
Titus	2	2	Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.	24	OEB
Titus	2	3	So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.	24	OEB
Titus	2	4	They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,	24	OEB
Titus	2	5	and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.	24	OEB
Titus	2	6	In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.	24	OEB
Titus	2	7	In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –	24	OEB
Titus	2	8	let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.	24	OEB
Titus	2	9	Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.	24	OEB
Titus	2	10	Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do.	24	OEB
Titus	2	11	For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,	24	OEB
Titus	2	12	leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,	24	OEB
Titus	2	13	while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.	24	OEB
Titus	2	14	For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.	24	OEB
Titus	2	15	Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.	24	OEB
Titus	3	1	Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,	24	OEB
Titus	3	2	to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.	24	OEB
Titus	3	3	There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.	24	OEB
Titus	3	4	But, when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,	24	OEB
Titus	3	5	not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,	24	OEB
Titus	3	6	which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior –	24	OEB
Titus	3	7	so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.	24	OEB
Titus	3	8	This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.	24	OEB
Titus	3	9	But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.	24	OEB
Titus	3	10	If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.	24	OEB
Titus	3	11	You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned.	24	OEB
Titus	3	12	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.	24	OEB
Titus	3	13	Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.	24	OEB
Titus	3	14	Let all our people learn to devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their lives may not be unfruitful.	24	OEB
Titus	3	15	All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting to our friends in the faith.	24	OEB
Revelation	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,	25	OEB
Revelation	1	2	who testified to the message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	3	Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for the time is near.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	4	From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,	25	OEB
Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood –	25	OEB
Revelation	1	6	and he made us a kingdom of priests in the service of God, his Father! – to him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	7	He is coming among the clouds! Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. So will it be. Amen.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	8	‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’  says the Lord,  the God who is, and who was, and who will be, the Almighty.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	9	I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	10	I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	11	It said –  ‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.’	25	OEB
Revelation	1	12	I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,	25	OEB
Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	14	The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;	25	OEB
Revelation	1	15	and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,	25	OEB
Revelation	1	16	in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	17	And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said –  ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,	25	OEB
Revelation	1	18	the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and of Hades.	25	OEB
Revelation	1	19	Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place –	25	OEB
Revelation	1	20	the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven churches.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	1	“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write	25	OEB
Revelation	2	2	I know your life, your toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers. I know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are apostles, though they are not, and how you proved them false.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	3	You possess endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	4	But this I have against you – You have abandoned your first love.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	5	Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp from its place, unless you repent.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	6	But this is in your favor – You hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	7	Anyone with ears should hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him who conquers – to him I will give the right to eat the fruit of the Tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	8	“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:	25	OEB
Revelation	2	9	I know your persecution and your poverty – yet you are rich! I know, too, the slander that comes from those who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 2:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are a congregation of Satan.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	10	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	11	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Those who conquer will suffer no hurt from the Second Death.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	12	“To the angel of the church in Pergamus write:	25	OEB
Revelation	2	13	I know where you live, where the throne of Satan stands. And yet you hold to my name, and you did not disown my faith even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death among you where Satan dwells.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	14	Yet I have a few things against you – You have among you those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	15	Again you have among you those who hold in the same way to the teaching of the Nikolaitans.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	16	Therefore repent, or else, I will come quickly and contend with such people with words that will cut like a sword.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	17	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To those who conquer – to them I will give a share of the mystic manna, and I will give them a white stone; and on the stone will be inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the person who receives it.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	18	“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:	25	OEB
Revelation	2	19	I know your life, your love, faith, service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been better than it was at first.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	20	Yet I have this against you – You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	21	I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	22	Therefore I am laying her on a bed of sickness, and bringing great suffering on those who are unfaithful with her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	23	I will also put her children to death; and all the churches will learn that I am he who looks into people’s hearts and souls; and I will give to each one of you what their life deserves.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	24	But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira – all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn the secrets of Satan, as people call them – I am not laying on you any further burden;	25	OEB
Revelation	2	25	only hold fast to what you have received, until I come.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	26	To those who conquer and are careful to live my life to the end – to them I will give authority over the nations,	25	OEB
Revelation	2	27	and they will rule them with an iron rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces (as I myself have received from my Father)	25	OEB
Revelation	2	28	and I will give them the morning star.	25	OEB
Revelation	2	29	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	1	“To the angel of the church in Sardis write:	25	OEB
Revelation	3	2	Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	3	Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	4	Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	5	Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes, and I will not strike their name out of the book of life; but I will own them before my Father, and before his angels.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	6	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	7	“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:	25	OEB
Revelation	3	8	I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	9	Listen, I give some of the congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 3:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are lying – I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will learn that I loved you.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	10	Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	11	I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may take your crown.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	12	Those who conquer – I will make them a pillar in the Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will write on them my new name.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	13	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	14	“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:	25	OEB
Revelation	3	15	I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot!	25	OEB
Revelation	3	16	But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	17	You say ‘I am rich and have grown rich, and I want for nothing,’ and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked!	25	OEB
Revelation	3	18	Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	19	All whom I love I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	20	I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	21	To those who conquer – to them I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, as I, when I conquered, took my seat beside my Father on his throne.	25	OEB
Revelation	3	22	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”	25	OEB
Revelation	4	1	After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’	25	OEB
Revelation	4	2	Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.	25	OEB
Revelation	4	3	He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and around the throne there was a rainbow of the color of an emerald.	25	OEB
Revelation	4	4	And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.	25	OEB
Revelation	4	5	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;	25	OEB
Revelation	4	6	and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.	25	OEB
Revelation	4	7	The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.	25	OEB
Revelation	4	8	These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say –	25	OEB
Revelation	4	9	And, whenever these creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,	25	OEB
Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying –	25	OEB
Revelation	4	11	‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’	25	OEB
Revelation	5	1	Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;	25	OEB
Revelation	5	2	and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’	25	OEB
Revelation	5	3	But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.	25	OEB
Revelation	5	4	At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.	25	OEB
Revelation	5	5	But one of the elders said to me – ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’	25	OEB
Revelation	5	6	Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)	25	OEB
Revelation	5	7	The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.	25	OEB
Revelation	5	8	And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)	25	OEB
Revelation	5	9	And they are singing a new song –	25	OEB
Revelation	5	10	and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’	25	OEB
Revelation	5	11	Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,	25	OEB
Revelation	5	12	and they cried in a loud voice –	25	OEB
Revelation	5	13	And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying –	25	OEB
Revelation	5	14	And the four creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	1	Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – ‘Come.’	25	OEB
Revelation	6	2	And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – ‘Come.’	25	OEB
Revelation	6	4	Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	5	When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	6	And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’	25	OEB
Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – ‘Come.’	25	OEB
Revelation	6	8	And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	10	They cried in a loud voice – ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’	25	OEB
Revelation	6	11	Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	12	And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	13	The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	14	The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.	25	OEB
Revelation	6	15	Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;	25	OEB
Revelation	6	16	and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,	25	OEB
Revelation	6	17	for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’	25	OEB
Revelation	7	1	After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.	25	OEB
Revelation	7	2	And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –	25	OEB
Revelation	7	3	‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’	25	OEB
Revelation	7	4	I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.	25	OEB
Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,	25	OEB
Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,	25	OEB
Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,	25	OEB
Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand,	25	OEB
Revelation	7	9	After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.	25	OEB
Revelation	7	10	And they are crying in a loud voice –	25	OEB
Revelation	7	11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,	25	OEB
Revelation	7	12	saying –	25	OEB
Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’	25	OEB
Revelation	7	14	‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’	25	OEB
Revelation	7	15	And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.	25	OEB
Revelation	7	16	Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;	25	OEB
Revelation	7	17	for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’	25	OEB
Revelation	8	1	As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	3	Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	7	The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	8	Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,	25	OEB
Revelation	8	9	and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	10	Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	11	(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.	25	OEB
Revelation	8	13	And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’	25	OEB
Revelation	9	1	Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	2	He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	3	Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	5	Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	6	In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	7	In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,	25	OEB
Revelation	9	8	and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,	25	OEB
Revelation	9	9	and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	11	They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer).	25	OEB
Revelation	9	12	The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!	25	OEB
Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	14	It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’	25	OEB
Revelation	9	15	Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	16	The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	17	And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulfur.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	18	Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur that issued from their mouths;	25	OEB
Revelation	9	19	for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.	25	OEB
Revelation	9	20	But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;	25	OEB
Revelation	9	21	and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.	25	OEB
Revelation	10	1	Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;	25	OEB
Revelation	10	2	in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;	25	OEB
Revelation	10	3	and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.	25	OEB
Revelation	10	4	And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’	25	OEB
Revelation	10	5	Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,	25	OEB
Revelation	10	6	and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.	25	OEB
Revelation	10	7	Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.	25	OEB
Revelation	10	8	Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – ‘Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.’	25	OEB
Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said ‘Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’	25	OEB
Revelation	10	10	I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.	25	OEB
Revelation	10	11	And I was told – ‘You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.’	25	OEB
Revelation	11	1	Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	2	But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	3	Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’	25	OEB
Revelation	11	4	These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	5	When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	6	These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	7	As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	8	Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	9	People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	10	Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	11	After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	12	The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	13	At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.	25	OEB
Revelation	11	14	The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!	25	OEB
Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying –	25	OEB
Revelation	11	16	At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped him,	25	OEB
Revelation	11	17	saying –	25	OEB
Revelation	11	18	The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’	25	OEB
Revelation	11	19	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	1	Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	3	Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	4	His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	5	The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	6	But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	7	Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,	25	OEB
Revelation	12	8	he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	9	Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said –	25	OEB
Revelation	12	11	Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	12	Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’	25	OEB
Revelation	12	13	When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	14	But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	15	Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	16	But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.	25	OEB
Revelation	12	17	The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;	25	OEB
Revelation	12	18	and he took his stand on the sea-shore.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	1	Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	2	The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	3	One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;	25	OEB
Revelation	13	4	and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – ‘Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?’	25	OEB
Revelation	13	5	The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	7	It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	8	All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	9	Let those who have ears hear.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	10	Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.)	25	OEB
Revelation	13	11	Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	12	It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	13	It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;	25	OEB
Revelation	13	14	and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honor of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	15	It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	16	High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,	25	OEB
Revelation	13	17	so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.	25	OEB
Revelation	13	18	(Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	1	Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	3	They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	4	These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	5	No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;	25	OEB
Revelation	14	7	and he cried in a loud voice – ‘Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	8	Then a second angel followed, crying – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	9	Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – ‘Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,	25	OEB
Revelation	14	10	that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulfur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	11	The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	12	(Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)	25	OEB
Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.”’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	14	Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – ‘Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	16	He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	18	Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – ‘Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.’	25	OEB
Revelation	14	19	The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.	25	OEB
Revelation	14	20	The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.	25	OEB
Revelation	15	1	Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvelous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.	25	OEB
Revelation	15	2	Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.	25	OEB
Revelation	15	3	They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb –	25	OEB
Revelation	15	4	Who will not honor and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.’	25	OEB
Revelation	15	5	After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,	25	OEB
Revelation	15	6	and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.	25	OEB
Revelation	15	7	One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.	25	OEB
Revelation	15	8	The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’	25	OEB
Revelation	16	2	The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	3	Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	4	Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;	25	OEB
Revelation	16	6	for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’	25	OEB
Revelation	16	7	And I heard the response from the altar – ‘Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.’	25	OEB
Revelation	16	8	Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;	25	OEB
Revelation	16	9	and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	10	Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,	25	OEB
Revelation	16	11	and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	12	Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	13	And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	14	They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	15	(‘I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.’)	25	OEB
Revelation	16	16	And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew ‘Har-Magedon.’	25	OEB
Revelation	16	17	Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said ‘All is over.’)	25	OEB
Revelation	16	18	There followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth – none so great;	25	OEB
Revelation	16	19	and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;	25	OEB
Revelation	16	20	and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.	25	OEB
Revelation	16	21	Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	1	Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the sentence passed on that Great Harlot who is seated at the meeting of many waters,	25	OEB
Revelation	17	2	and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.’	25	OEB
Revelation	17	3	And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;	25	OEB
Revelation	17	5	while on her forehead there was written this mystic name – ‘BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ALL IDOLATROUS ABOMINATIONS ON EARTH.’	25	OEB
Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;	25	OEB
Revelation	17	7	but the angel said to me – ‘Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	8	The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.’	25	OEB
Revelation	17	9	(Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	10	They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	11	So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	13	These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	14	They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	15	And the angel said to me – ‘The waters that you saw, where the Harlot is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	16	The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast – they will hate the Harlot, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	17	For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their kingdoms to the Beast, until God’s decrees will be executed.	25	OEB
Revelation	17	18	As for the woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the kings of the earth.’	25	OEB
Revelation	18	1	After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	2	With a mighty voice he cried – “She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	3	For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying – “Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	5	For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	6	Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;	25	OEB
Revelation	18	7	for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’	25	OEB
Revelation	18	8	Therefore in one day will these curses strike her – death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	9	All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,	25	OEB
Revelation	18	10	while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry – “Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour your judgment fell.”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes –	25	OEB
Revelation	18	12	their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;	25	OEB
Revelation	18	13	nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	14	The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	15	The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying –	25	OEB
Revelation	18	16	“Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments, and precious stones, and pearls!	25	OEB
Revelation	18	17	In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.” Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,	25	OEB
Revelation	18	18	and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried – “What city can compare with the Great city?”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	19	They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – “Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!	25	OEB
Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying – “So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.	25	OEB
Revelation	18	22	No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;	25	OEB
Revelation	18	23	no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.”	25	OEB
Revelation	18	24	Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	1	After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying –	25	OEB
Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	3	Again they cried – ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	4	Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;	25	OEB
Revelation	19	5	and from the throne there came a voice which said –	25	OEB
Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying –	25	OEB
Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honor, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	8	And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	9	Then a voice said to me ‘Write – “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said – ‘These words of God are true.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	10	I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	11	Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	12	His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;	25	OEB
Revelation	19	13	he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	15	From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;	25	OEB
Revelation	19	16	and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,	25	OEB
Revelation	19	18	to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’	25	OEB
Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	20	The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulfur.	25	OEB
Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	2	He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	3	He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	4	Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	5	(The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his prison,	25	OEB
Revelation	20	8	and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	9	They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;	25	OEB
Revelation	20	10	and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.	25	OEB
Revelation	20	14	Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;	25	OEB
Revelation	20	15	and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.	25	OEB
Revelation	21	1	Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.	25	OEB
Revelation	21	2	And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.	25	OEB
Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,	25	OEB
Revelation	21	4	and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’	25	OEB
Revelation	21	5	And he who was seated on the throne said – ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said – ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’	25	OEB
Revelation	21	6	And he said to me – ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.	25	OEB
Revelation	21	7	Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.	25	OEB
Revelation	21	8	But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars – their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulfur. That is the Second Death.’	25	OEB
Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’	25	OEB
