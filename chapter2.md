## Introduction

## Relevant Literature

## Methods & Data
As data, we are using the Biblia Sacra iuxta Vulgatam Clementinam released in released in 2006 by Michaele Tweedale as stored in the MLAT database. From this Bible, we have extracted 11 Latin passages that represent a mixture of neutral language (e.g. in historical descriptions, genealogical record and legal rules), psalms and poems. This resulted in 603 Latin words. For each passage, we have collected three English translations: the translation in the English Standard Version bible (ESV, 2001), in the Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition bible (DRB, 1899) and in the King James Version bible (KJV, 1611). This resulted in 2558 English words.
- Category: Primary source / raw data?
- Degrees of processing: The texts are minimally processed versions. Any annotations or digital enhancements were deleted. However, the translation into different bibles have obvious differences - which could be attributed to processing by the author due to theological priorities and cultural conventions of the time (e.g. the psalms in the DRB seem closer to narrative prose than the lyrical and poetic style in other translations).
- Results in different levels of data???
- Origin: The Bible can be considered **observational data** in the sense that it documents the beliefs, historical events, societal norms, and cultural practices as observed or understood by its authors at the time. Unlike experimental data, the content was observed within the natural context of its time.
The Bible is also a collection of texts from different authors, time periods, and cultural contexts. These individual books were **gathered** over centuries and assembled into a cohesive canon. In this sense, it represents gathered data.
Parts of the Bible, such as the historical books (e.g. Chronicles) and the laws, serve as **records** of events and rules observed by the authors. They were intended to document a continuous record.
- Collection: Resource/community data collection because it was preserved, maintained, and accessed by communities for ongoing reference, teaching, and study.

For more “neutral” texts, we are using De Legibus by Cicero and the Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth...
