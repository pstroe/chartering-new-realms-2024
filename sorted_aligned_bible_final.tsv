1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	1	14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins:
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	1	15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: The firstborn.... That is, first begotten; as the Evangelist declares, the only begotten of his Father: hence, St. Chrisostom explains firstborn, not first created, as he was not created at all, but born of his Father before all ages; that is, coeval with the Father and with the Holy Ghost.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	1	16	For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers. All things were created by him and in him.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	7	Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned: abounding in him in thanksgiving.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	8	Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit: according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	10	And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	11	In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh: but in the circumcision of Christ.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	12	Buried with him in baptism: in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	13	And you, when you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences:
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	14	Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	15	And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths, In meat, etc.... He means with regard to the Jewish observations of the distinction of clean and unclean meats; and of their festivals, new moons, and sabbaths, as being no longer obligatory.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body is of Christ.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	18	Let no man seduce you, willing in humility and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh: Willing, etc.... That is, by a self willed, self invented, superstitious worship, falsely pretending humility, but really proceeding from pride. Such was the worship, that many of the philosophers (against whom St. Paul speaks, ver. 8) paid to angels or demons, by sacrificing to them, as carriers of intelligence betwixt God and men; pretending humility in so doing, as if God was too great to be addressed by men; and setting aside the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, who is the head both of angels and men. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics, disciples of Simon and Menander, to the angels, whom they believed to be makers and lords of this lower world. This is certain, that they whom the apostle here condemns, did not hold the head, (ver. 19,) that is, Jesus Christ, and his mediatorship; and therefore what he writes here no way touches the Catholic doctrine and practice, of desiring our good angels to pray to God for us, through Jesus Christ. St. Jerome [Epist. ad Algas.] understands by the religion or service of angels, the Jewish teachers, who sought to subject the new Christians to the observance of the Mosaic law.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	20	If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	21	Touch not: taste not: handle not. Touch not, etc.... The meaning is, that Christians should not subject themselves, either to the ordinances of the old law, forbidding touching or tasting things unclean; or to the superstitious invention of heretics, imposing such restraints, under pretence of wisdom, humility, or mortification.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	22	Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh. Colossians Chapter 3 He exhorts them to put off the old man, and to put on the new. The duties of wives and husbands, children and servants.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	1	Therefore if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	2	Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	3	For you are dead: and your life is hid with Christ in God.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	4	When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness, which is the service of idols.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	8	But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	10	And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	11	Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	12	Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	13	Bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	14	But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter towards them.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	20	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	21	Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh: not serving to the eye, as pleasing men: but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	23	Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:
1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	3	24	Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you: and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabas, touching whom you have received commandments. If he come unto you, receive him.

1	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans. And that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.... What this epistle was is uncertain, and annotators have given different opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an epistle which St. Paul wrote to the Laodiceans, and is since lost, for that now extant is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of St. Paul; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that epistle. Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St. Paul by the Laodiceans, which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them. However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable that St. Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans, about the same time that he wrote to the Colossians, as he had them both equally at heart, and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the Colossians for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate to each other what they had received from him; as one epistle might contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers, against which the apostle was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their pernicious doctrine.

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	6	For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	7	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	10	And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	14	And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	3	Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

1	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, also a follower of the Lord.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	2	To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	3	Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	4	now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	6	bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	7	It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	8	and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	9	And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	10	Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;
1	OEB	Colossians	1	11	you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;
1	OEB	Colossians	1	12	and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	13	For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his love,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	14	and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	15	For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – firstborn and head of all creation;
1	OEB	Colossians	1	16	for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	17	All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;
1	OEB	Colossians	1	18	and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The firstborn from the dead, he is to the church the source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	21	And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –
1	OEB	Colossians	1	22	but now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	23	if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	24	Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;
1	OEB	Colossians	1	25	of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –
1	OEB	Colossians	1	26	that truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,
1	OEB	Colossians	1	27	to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – ‘Christ among you! Your hope of glory!’
1	OEB	Colossians	1	28	This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.
1	OEB	Colossians	1	29	It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	1	I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;
1	OEB	Colossians	2	2	in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,
1	OEB	Colossians	2	3	even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	4	I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	5	It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	6	Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –
1	OEB	Colossians	2	7	rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	8	Take care that there is not someone who will carry you away by his ‘philosophy’ – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	9	For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;
1	OEB	Colossians	2	10	and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	11	By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	12	For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	13	And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!
1	OEB	Colossians	2	14	He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!
1	OEB	Colossians	2	15	He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!
1	OEB	Colossians	2	16	Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	17	These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	18	Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called ‘humility’ and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	19	They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	20	Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,
1	OEB	Colossians	2	21	to such ordinances as ‘Do not handle, or taste, or touch’?
1	OEB	Colossians	2	22	For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.
1	OEB	Colossians	2	23	Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	1	Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	2	Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	3	For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	4	When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	5	Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	6	These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,
1	OEB	Colossians	3	7	and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	8	You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	9	Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,
1	OEB	Colossians	3	10	and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	11	In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all!
1	OEB	Colossians	3	12	Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;
1	OEB	Colossians	3	13	bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	14	Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	16	Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	17	And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	18	Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	20	Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	21	Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	22	Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,
1	OEB	Colossians	3	24	since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.
1	OEB	Colossians	3	25	Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	1	Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	2	Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;
1	OEB	Colossians	4	3	and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains!
1	OEB	Colossians	4	4	Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	5	Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	6	Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	7	Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	8	I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	9	With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	10	My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)
1	OEB	Colossians	4	11	Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	13	I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	14	Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	15	Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	16	And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.
1	OEB	Colossians	4	17	Give this message to Archippus – ‘Take care to discharge to the best of your ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master’s cause.’
1	OEB	Colossians	4	18	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these chains of mine. God’s blessing be with you.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	2	to the saints and faithful brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} in Christ at Colossae:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	7	even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	8	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	9	For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	10	that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	11	strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	13	who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have our redemption,{TR adds through his blood,} the forgiveness of our sins;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	16	For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	17	He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	19	For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	21	You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	22	yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	23	if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
1	WEB	Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	25	of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	26	the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,
1	WEB	Colossians	1	27	to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	28	whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
1	WEB	Colossians	1	29	for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	1	For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
1	WEB	Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,
1	WEB	Colossians	2	3	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	4	Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	5	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	6	As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,
1	WEB	Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	8	Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	9	For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,
1	WEB	Colossians	2	10	and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;
1	WEB	Colossians	2	11	in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
1	WEB	Colossians	2	12	having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	13	You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh.  He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
1	WEB	Colossians	2	14	wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
1	WEB	Colossians	2	15	having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,
1	WEB	Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.
1	WEB	Colossians	2	18	Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	14	That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	15	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	20	But ye have not so learned Christ;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	27	Neither give place to the devil.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	32	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	9	(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	2	Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	21	But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
2	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

2	OEB	Ephesians	1	1	To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	4	For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	5	From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	6	and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	7	for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	8	All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	9	when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	10	in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, center in him.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	11	In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	12	that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	13	And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	14	And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	15	And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	16	have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	17	My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	18	that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	19	and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	20	The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	21	and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	22	And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;
2	OEB	Ephesians	1	23	for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	1	You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	2	For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	3	And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	4	Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	5	even though we were dead because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	6	And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	7	in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	8	For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	9	It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	11	Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘the Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘the Circumcised’ – circumcised only by human hands!
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	12	Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the covenants founded on God’s promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	13	But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	14	He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	15	and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	16	And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	17	He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	18	for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	19	It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s household.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	20	You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	21	United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.
2	OEB	Ephesians	2	22	And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	1	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	2	For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	3	and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	4	And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	5	In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	6	That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	7	Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	8	Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	9	and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	10	so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	11	in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	12	And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	15	from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	16	and pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	17	so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; and I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	18	have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	19	and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled with all the fullness of God.
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	20	To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –
2	OEB	Ephesians	3	21	to him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	1	I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	2	always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	3	and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	4	There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	5	There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	6	There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	7	Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	8	That is why it is said –
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	9	Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	10	He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	11	And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	12	to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	13	And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	14	Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	15	but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	16	For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	17	This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	18	with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	19	Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	20	But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	21	and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	22	For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	23	that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	24	and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	25	Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	27	and give no opportunity to the devil.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	28	Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	29	Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.
2	OEB	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	1	Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	2	and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	3	As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	4	nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	5	For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	6	Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore have nothing to do with such people.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	8	For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	9	for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	10	always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	11	Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	12	It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	13	All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	14	For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said –
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	15	Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	16	making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	18	Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	19	Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	20	Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	21	Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	22	Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	23	For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Savior of his body.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	26	to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	27	so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	28	That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	29	for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	30	for we are members of his body.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	31	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	32	In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.
2	OEB	Ephesians	5	33	However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	2	‘Honor your father and mother’ – this is the first Commandment with a promise –
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	3	‘so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.’
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	4	And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	6	not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	7	Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	8	for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	10	For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	12	For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breastplate,
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	15	and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	16	At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	17	And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	18	Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	19	and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	20	on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	21	To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the Master’s cause, will tell you everything.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	22	I am sending him to you on purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your hearts.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	23	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower peace, and love linked with faith.
2	OEB	Ephesians	6	24	May God’s blessing be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	5	having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	8	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	9	making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	10	to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	11	in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	12	to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	13	in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	14	who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	15	For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	16	don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	18	having the eyes of your hearts{TR reads understanding instead of hearts} enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	19	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	20	which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	21	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	22	He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,
2	WEB	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	1	You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	2	in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	3	among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	4	But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	6	and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	8	for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	9	not of works, that no one would boast.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, (in the flesh, made by hands);
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	12	that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	20	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	21	in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;
2	WEB	Ephesians	2	22	in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	1	For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	2	if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	3	how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	4	by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	7	of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	8	To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	9	and to make all men see what is the administration{TR reads fellowship instead of administration} of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	10	to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	14	For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	18	may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	19	and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
2	WEB	Ephesians	3	21	to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever.  Amen.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	1	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	3	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.{Psalm 68:18}
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	9	Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	11	He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds{or, pastors} and teachers;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	14	that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	15	but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	16	from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	19	who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ that way;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	22	that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	23	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor.  For we are members of one another.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry, and don't sin.{Psalm 4:4} Don't let the sun go down on your wrath,
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	28	Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	30	Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.
2	WEB	Ephesians	4	32	And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	1	Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	2	Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	3	But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	4	nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	5	Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words.  For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore don't be partakers with them.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	8	For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	9	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	10	proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	11	Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	12	For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	13	But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	14	Therefore he says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	15	Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	18	Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	21	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	22	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	24	But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	27	that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	28	Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies.  He who loves his own wife loves himself.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	31	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife.  The two will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.
2	WEB	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	2	Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	3	that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.{Deuteronomy 5:16}
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	4	You fathers, don't provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	5	Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	6	not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	7	with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	9	You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	15	and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	16	above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.  Amen.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	18	with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	19	on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	21	But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
2	WEB	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	1	In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	2	When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	3	Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	4	That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	5	And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	6	And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	7	And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king’s magnificence.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	8	Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	9	Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	10	Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	11	To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	12	But she refused, and would not come at the king’s commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	13	Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	14	(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	15	What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	16	And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	18	And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king’s indignation is just.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	19	If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	20	And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	21	His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	1	22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people. Esther Chapter 2 Esther is advanced to be queen. Mardochai detecteth a plot against the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	1	After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	2	And the king’s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	3	And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king’s women: and let them receive women’s ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	4	And whosoever among them all shall please the king’s eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	5	There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	7	And he had brought up his brother’s daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	8	And when the king’s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	9	And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women’s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king’s house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	10	And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	11	And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Esther’s welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	12	Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	13	And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king’s chamber.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	14	And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king’s concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	15	And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	16	So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	18	And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king’s gate,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	20	Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	21	At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king’s gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	22	And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai’s name, who had reported the thing unto her.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	2	23	It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king. Esther Chapter 3 Aman, advanced by the king, is offended at Mardochai, and therefore procureth the king’s decree to destroy the whole nation of the Jews.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	1	After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	2	And all the king’s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	3	And the king’s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king’s commandment?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	4	And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	5	Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	6	And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	7	In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	8	And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	9	If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	10	And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	11	And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	12	And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	13	Were sent by the king’s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	14	And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	3	15	The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king’s commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping. Esther Chapter 4 Mardochai desireth Esther to petition the king for the Jews. They join in fasting and prayer.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	1	Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	2	And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king’s court.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	3	And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king’s cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	4	Then Esther’s maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	5	And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	6	And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	7	And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king’s treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	8	He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	9	And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	10	She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	11	All the king’s servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king’s inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	12	And when Mardochai had heard this,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	13	He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king’s house, more than all the Jews:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	14	For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father’s house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	15	And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	16	Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	4	17	So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him. Esther Chapter 5 Esther is graciously received: she inviteth the king and Aman to dinner, Aman prepareth a gibbet for Mardochai.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	1	And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	2	And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	3	And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	4	But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	5	And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther’s will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	6	And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	7	And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	8	If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	9	So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	10	But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	11	And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	12	And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	13	And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king’s gate.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	5	14	Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared. Esther Chapter 6 The king hearing of the good service done him by Mardochai, commandeth Aman to honour him next to the king, which he performeth.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	1	That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	2	They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	3	And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all. No reward at all.... He received some presents from the king, chap. 12.5; but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers, that they esteemed them as nothing at all.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	4	And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king’s house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	5	The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	6	And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	7	Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	8	Ought to be clothed with the king’s apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	9	And let the first of the king’s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	10	And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	11	So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	12	But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	13	And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	6	14	As they were yet speaking, the king’s eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared. Esther Chapter 7 Esther’s petition for herself and her people: Aman is hanged upon the gibbet he had prepared for Mardochai.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	1	So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	2	And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	3	Then she answered: If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	4	For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	5	And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	6	And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	7	But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	8	And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king’s mouth, and immediately they covered his face.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	9	And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman’s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	7	10	So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king’s wrath ceased. Esther Chapter 8 Mardochai is advanced: Aman’s letters are reversed.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	1	On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	2	And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	3	And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	4	But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	5	And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king’s provinces, may be reversed by new letters.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	6	For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	7	And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman’s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	8	Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king’s name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king’s name, and were sealed with his ring.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	9	Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	10	And these letters which were sent in the king’s name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	11	And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	12	And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	13	And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	14	So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king’s edict was hung up in Susan.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	15	And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king’s presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced, and was glad.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	16	But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	8	17	And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: Insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all. Esther Chapter 9 The Jews kill their enemies that would have killed them. The days of Phurim are appointed to be kept holy.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	1	So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries. To revenge, etc.... The Jews on this occasion, by authority from the king, were made executioners of the public justice, for punishing by death a crime worthy of death, viz., a malicious conspiracy for extirpating their whole nation.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	2	And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	3	And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	4	For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men’s mouths.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	5	So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	6	Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	7	Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	8	And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	9	And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	10	And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	11	And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	12	And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	13	And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	14	And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	15	And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	16	Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king’s dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	17	Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	18	But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	19	But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	20	And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king’s provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	21	That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	22	Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	24	For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	25	And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king’s letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	26	And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	27	And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	28	These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	29	And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	30	And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	31	And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	9	32	And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther. Esther Chapter 10 Assuerus’s greatness. Mardochai’s dignity.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	10	1	And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	10	2	And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	10	3	And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	10	4	Then Mardochai said: God hath done these things. Then Mardochai, etc....

3	DRB	The Book of Esther	10	11	And both lots came to the day appointed already from that time before God to all nations:

3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	2	Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly without any terror, and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all men,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	3	But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by name,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	4	Told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, despised the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	5	Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all mankind using perverse laws, and going against our commandments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	6	We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	7	That these wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	8	But Mardochai besought the Lord, remembering all his works,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	9	And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	10	Thou hast made heaven and earth and all things that are under the cope of heaven.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	11	Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	12	Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	13	(For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,)
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	14	But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	15	And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, because our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	16	Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	17	Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, O Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	13	18	And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads. Esther Chapter 14 The prayer of Esther for herself and her people.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	1	Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	2	And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	3	And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying: O my Lord, who alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	4	My danger is in my hands.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	5	I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	6	We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	7	For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	8	And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	9	They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	10	That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	11	Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	12	Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	13	Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	14	But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	15	And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	16	Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my pride and glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	17	And that I have not eaten at Aman’s table, nor hath the king’s banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink offerings:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	18	And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	14	19	O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear. Esther Chapter 15 Esther comes into the king’s presence: she is terrified, but God turns his heart.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	1	And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	2	Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	3	And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	4	And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her glorious apparel.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	5	And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	6	And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	7	And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the ground.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	8	But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	9	So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	10	And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	11	And God changed the king’s spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	12	What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	13	Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	14	Come near then, and touch the sceptre.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	15	And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	16	She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	17	For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	18	And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	15	19	But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her. Esther Chapter 16 A copy of the king’s letter in favour of the Jews.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	1	The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting. From India to Ethiopia.... That is, who reigneth from India to Ethiopia.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	2	Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	3	And not only endeavour to oppress the king’s subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	4	Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	5	And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all men’s praise,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	6	While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	7	Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	8	Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	9	Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	10	Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	11	And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	12	But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	13	For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	14	Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	15	But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	16	And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	17	Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	18	For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	19	But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	20	And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	21	For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	22	Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	23	That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.
3	DRB	The Book of Esther	16	24	And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	2	That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	3	In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	4	When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	6	Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	8	And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	11	To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	14	And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	18	Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	20	And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	1	22	For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	2	Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	4	And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	5	Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	8	So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	10	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	12	Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	13	Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	22	And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	2	23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	2	And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	3	Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	7	In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	12	Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	3	15	The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	1	When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	2	And came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	3	And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	4	So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	5	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	6	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king’s gate.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	10	Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	11	All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	12	And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	15	Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	4	And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	8	If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	5	14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	3	And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	5	And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	8	Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	9	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	12	And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	6	14	And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	5	Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	6	And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	9	And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	5	And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king’s provinces:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	7	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	9	Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	10	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	11	Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	12	Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	14	So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	16	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	8	17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	2	The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	8	And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	9	And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	10	The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	15	For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	16	But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	17	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	18	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	21	To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	22	As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	24	Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	25	But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	26	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	27	The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	28	And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	31	To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	9	32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	10	1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	10	2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
3	KJV	The Book of Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
3	OEB	Esther	1	1	These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia
3	OEB	Esther	1	2	from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.
3	OEB	Esther	1	3	In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present
3	OEB	Esther	1	4	while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.
3	OEB	Esther	1	5	When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.
3	OEB	Esther	1	6	There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.
3	OEB	Esther	1	7	Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.
3	OEB	Esther	1	8	The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.
3	OEB	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.
3	OEB	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants
3	OEB	Esther	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.
3	OEB	Esther	1	12	But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.
3	OEB	Esther	1	13	The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.
3	OEB	Esther	1	14	Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
3	OEB	Esther	1	15	“Queen Vashti”, the king said, “has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?”
3	OEB	Esther	1	16	Memucan replied before the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.
3	OEB	Esther	1	17	The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!’
3	OEB	Esther	1	18	This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife!
3	OEB	Esther	1	19	If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.
3	OEB	Esther	1	20	When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honor to their husbands.”
3	OEB	Esther	1	21	The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.
3	OEB	Esther	1	22	He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!
3	OEB	Esther	2	1	Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.
3	OEB	Esther	2	2	Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,
3	OEB	Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,
3	OEB	Esther	2	4	and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.
3	OEB	Esther	2	5	In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.
3	OEB	Esther	2	6	(Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)
3	OEB	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.
3	OEB	Esther	2	8	When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.
3	OEB	Esther	2	9	The girl pleased him and gained his favor, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
3	OEB	Esther	2	10	Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.
3	OEB	Esther	2	11	Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.
3	OEB	Esther	2	12	The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,
3	OEB	Esther	2	13	each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,
3	OEB	Esther	2	14	and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.
3	OEB	Esther	2	15	When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.
3	OEB	Esther	2	16	Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
3	OEB	Esther	2	17	And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favorite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
3	OEB	Esther	2	18	Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honor of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
3	OEB	Esther	2	19	All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.
3	OEB	Esther	2	20	Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.
3	OEB	Esther	2	21	In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
3	OEB	Esther	2	22	But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
3	OEB	Esther	2	23	When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.
3	OEB	Esther	3	1	After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.
3	OEB	Esther	3	2	All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.
3	OEB	Esther	3	3	Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”
3	OEB	Esther	3	4	When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
3	OEB	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.
3	OEB	Esther	3	6	But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
3	OEB	Esther	3	7	In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had ‘pur’ (which means ‘lot’) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.
3	OEB	Esther	3	8	So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.
3	OEB	Esther	3	9	If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.”
3	OEB	Esther	3	10	So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
3	OEB	Esther	3	11	“The money is yours,” the king said to Haman, “and the people also to do with them as you wish.”
3	OEB	Esther	3	12	And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.
3	OEB	Esther	3	13	Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.
3	OEB	Esther	3	14	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.
3	OEB	Esther	3	15	By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.
3	OEB	Esther	4	1	When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.
3	OEB	Esther	4	2	He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.
3	OEB	Esther	4	3	In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.
3	OEB	Esther	4	4	When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behavior, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.
3	OEB	Esther	4	5	So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.
3	OEB	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.
3	OEB	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
3	OEB	Esther	4	8	Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.
3	OEB	Esther	4	9	When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,
3	OEB	Esther	4	10	she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,
3	OEB	Esther	4	11	“All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.”
3	OEB	Esther	4	12	When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,
3	OEB	Esther	4	13	he sent back this reply to Esther, “Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.
3	OEB	Esther	4	14	If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!”
3	OEB	Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:
3	OEB	Esther	4	16	“Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.”
3	OEB	Esther	4	17	Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.
3	OEB	Esther	5	1	On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.
3	OEB	Esther	5	2	When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favor, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.
3	OEB	Esther	5	3	Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	4	“If it seems best to the king,” Esther said, “let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	5	Then the king ordered, “Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	6	While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	7	Esther answered,
3	OEB	Esther	5	8	“If I have won the king’s favor and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	9	Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.
3	OEB	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife
3	OEB	Esther	5	11	and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.
3	OEB	Esther	5	12	“What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.
3	OEB	Esther	5	13	Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
3	OEB	Esther	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.
3	OEB	Esther	6	1	On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before the king.
3	OEB	Esther	6	2	It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
3	OEB	Esther	6	3	“What honor and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?” the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied “Nothing has been done for him,”
3	OEB	Esther	6	4	the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
3	OEB	Esther	6	5	So the king’s pages said to him, “Haman is standing there, in the court.” The king said, “Let him enter.”
3	OEB	Esther	6	6	So Haman entered, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom besides me could the king wish to honor?”
3	OEB	Esther	6	7	So he said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor
3	OEB	Esther	6	8	let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.
3	OEB	Esther	6	9	Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and let him lead that man on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’”
3	OEB	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.”
3	OEB	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.”
3	OEB	Esther	6	12	Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.
3	OEB	Esther	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai before whom you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do nothing against him but will surely fall before him.”
3	OEB	Esther	6	14	While they were still talking with him, the king’s attendants came and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
3	OEB	Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther.
3	OEB	Esther	7	2	As they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you. Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the kingdom.”
3	OEB	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered, “Your Majesty, if I have won your favor, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request,
3	OEB	Esther	7	4	for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.”
3	OEB	Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he and where is he whose heart has impelled him to do this?”
3	OEB	Esther	7	6	“A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.” Esther answered. Haman shrank in terror before the king and the queen.
3	OEB	Esther	7	7	In his wrath the king rose from the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king was fully determined to bring calamity upon him.
3	OEB	Esther	7	8	As the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on Esther’s couch. The king cried, “Is he going to rape my queen while I am present in my own house?”
3	OEB	Esther	7	9	and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, “There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!” The king said “Hang him on them.”
3	OEB	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king was pacified.
3	OEB	Esther	8	1	At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king’s personal advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her.
3	OEB	Esther	8	2	The king also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman’s property.
3	OEB	Esther	8	3	Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.
3	OEB	Esther	8	4	The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.
3	OEB	Esther	8	5	“If it seems best to the king,” she said, “and if I have won his favor and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.
3	OEB	Esther	8	6	For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?”
3	OEB	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.
3	OEB	Esther	8	8	Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”
3	OEB	Esther	8	9	On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
3	OEB	Esther	8	10	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.
3	OEB	Esther	8	11	In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder
3	OEB	Esther	8	12	throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).
3	OEB	Esther	8	13	A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.
3	OEB	Esther	8	14	So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands!
3	OEB	Esther	8	15	and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.
3	OEB	Esther	8	16	To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honor.
3	OEB	Esther	8	17	And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	2	The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.
3	OEB	Esther	9	3	All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.
3	OEB	Esther	9	5	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	6	In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.
3	OEB	Esther	9	7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
3	OEB	Esther	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
3	OEB	Esther	9	9	Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
3	OEB	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.
3	OEB	Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,
3	OEB	Esther	9	12	and the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.”
3	OEB	Esther	9	13	“If it please the king,” Esther said, “let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
3	OEB	Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.
3	OEB	Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.
3	OEB	Esther	9	16	And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.
3	OEB	Esther	9	17	This was on the thirteenth day of Adar.
3	OEB	Esther	9	18	(But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)
3	OEB	Esther	9	19	This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.
3	OEB	Esther	9	20	Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.
3	OEB	Esther	9	21	He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,
3	OEB	Esther	9	22	as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.
3	OEB	Esther	9	23	So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast ‘Pur’, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.
3	OEB	Esther	9	25	But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
3	OEB	Esther	9	26	This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,
3	OEB	Esther	9	27	the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,
3	OEB	Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.
3	OEB	Esther	9	29	Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.
3	OEB	Esther	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,
3	OEB	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.
3	OEB	Esther	9	32	And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.
3	OEB	Esther	10	1	King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.
3	OEB	Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
3	OEB	Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.
3	WEB	Esther	1	1	Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),
3	WEB	Esther	1	2	that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
3	WEB	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.
3	WEB	Esther	1	4	He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.
3	WEB	Esther	1	5	When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
3	WEB	Esther	1	6	There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars.  The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.
3	WEB	Esther	1	7	They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.
3	WEB	Esther	1	8	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
3	WEB	Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
3	WEB	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
3	WEB	Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.
3	WEB	Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the eunuchs.  Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.
3	WEB	Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;
3	WEB	Esther	1	14	and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),
3	WEB	Esther	1	15	What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?
3	WEB	Esther	1	16	Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.
3	WEB	Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.'
3	WEB	Esther	1	18	Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.
3	WEB	Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.
3	WEB	Esther	1	20	When the king's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.
3	WEB	Esther	1	21	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
3	WEB	Esther	1	22	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.
3	WEB	Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
3	WEB	Esther	2	2	Then the king's servants who served him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.
3	WEB	Esther	2	3	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;
3	WEB	Esther	2	4	and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king, and he did so.
3	WEB	Esther	2	5	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
3	WEB	Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
3	WEB	Esther	2	7	He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother.  The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
3	WEB	Esther	2	8	So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
3	WEB	Esther	2	9	The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house.  He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house.
3	WEB	Esther	2	10	Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.
3	WEB	Esther	2	11	Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.
3	WEB	Esther	2	12	Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).
3	WEB	Esther	2	13	The young woman then came to the king like this:  whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house.
3	WEB	Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines.  She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
3	WEB	Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised.  Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.
3	WEB	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
3	WEB	Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
3	WEB	Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.
3	WEB	Esther	2	19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.
3	WEB	Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.
3	WEB	Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.
3	WEB	Esther	2	22	This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.
3	WEB	Esther	2	23	When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence.
3	WEB	Esther	3	1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.
3	WEB	Esther	3	2	All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him.  But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.
3	WEB	Esther	3	3	Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you disobey the king's commandment?
3	WEB	Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
3	WEB	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.
3	WEB	Esther	3	6	But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.
3	WEB	Esther	3	7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
3	WEB	Esther	3	8	Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.
3	WEB	Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
3	WEB	Esther	3	10	The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
3	WEB	Esther	3	11	The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.
3	WEB	Esther	3	12	Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language.  It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring.
3	WEB	Esther	3	13	Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.
3	WEB	Esther	3	14	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
3	WEB	Esther	3	15	The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
3	WEB	Esther	4	1	Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.
3	WEB	Esther	4	2	He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
3	WEB	Esther	4	3	In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
3	WEB	Esther	4	4	Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved.  She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.
3	WEB	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.
3	WEB	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate.
3	WEB	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
3	WEB	Esther	4	8	He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.
3	WEB	Esther	4	9	Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
3	WEB	Esther	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:
3	WEB	Esther	4	11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
3	WEB	Esther	4	12	They told to Mordecai Esther's words.
3	WEB	Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, Don't think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.
3	WEB	Esther	4	14	For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish.  Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
3	WEB	Esther	4	15	Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,
3	WEB	Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day.  I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.
3	WEB	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
3	WEB	Esther	5	1	Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house.  The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.
3	WEB	Esther	5	2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.
3	WEB	Esther	5	3	Then the king asked her, What would you like, queen Esther?  What is your request?  It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.
3	WEB	Esther	5	4	Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
3	WEB	Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.  So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
3	WEB	Esther	5	6	The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
3	WEB	Esther	5	7	Then Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is this.
3	WEB	Esther	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.
3	WEB	Esther	5	9	Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
3	WEB	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.
3	WEB	Esther	5	11	Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
3	WEB	Esther	5	12	Haman also said, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.
3	WEB	Esther	5	13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
3	WEB	Esther	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
3	WEB	Esther	6	1	On that night, the king couldn't sleep.  He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.
3	WEB	Esther	6	2	It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.
3	WEB	Esther	6	3	The king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?  Then the king's servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him.
3	WEB	Esther	6	4	The king said, Who is in the court?  Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
3	WEB	Esther	6	5	The king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. The king said, Let him come in.
3	WEB	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in.  The king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?
3	WEB	Esther	6	7	Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,
3	WEB	Esther	6	8	let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set.
3	WEB	Esther	6	9	Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!'
3	WEB	Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate.  Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.
3	WEB	Esther	6	11	Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!
3	WEB	Esther	6	12	Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
3	WEB	Esther	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.  Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.
3	WEB	Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
3	WEB	Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
3	WEB	Esther	7	2	The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request?  Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
3	WEB	Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
3	WEB	Esther	7	4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.  But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's loss.
3	WEB	Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?
3	WEB	Esther	7	6	Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!  Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
3	WEB	Esther	7	7	The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden.  Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
3	WEB	Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was.  Then the king said, Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?  As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
3	WEB	Esther	7	9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman's house.  The king said, Hang him on it!
3	WEB	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.  Then was the king's wrath pacified.
3	WEB	Esther	8	1	On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen.  Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.
3	WEB	Esther	8	2	The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.  Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
3	WEB	Esther	8	3	Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
3	WEB	Esther	8	4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.
3	WEB	Esther	8	5	She said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
3	WEB	Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?
3	WEB	Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.
3	WEB	Esther	8	8	Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may not be reversed by any man.
3	WEB	Esther	8	9	Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.
3	WEB	Esther	8	10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds.
3	WEB	Esther	8	11	In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,
3	WEB	Esther	8	12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
3	WEB	Esther	8	13	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
3	WEB	Esther	8	14	So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.
3	WEB	Esther	8	15	Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.
3	WEB	Esther	8	16	The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.
3	WEB	Esther	8	17	In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day.  Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.
3	WEB	Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),
3	WEB	Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them.  No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.
3	WEB	Esther	9	3	All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
3	WEB	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.
3	WEB	Esther	9	5	The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.
3	WEB	Esther	9	6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
3	WEB	Esther	9	7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
3	WEB	Esther	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
3	WEB	Esther	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
3	WEB	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.
3	WEB	Esther	9	11	On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.
3	WEB	Esther	9	12	The king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!  Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you.  What is your further request? It shall be done.
3	WEB	Esther	9	13	Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.
3	WEB	Esther	9	14	The king commanded this to be done.  A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
3	WEB	Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn't lay their hand on the spoil.
3	WEB	Esther	9	16	The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.
3	WEB	Esther	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
3	WEB	Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
3	WEB	Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.
3	WEB	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,
3	WEB	Esther	9	21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,
3	WEB	Esther	9	22	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.
3	WEB	Esther	9	23	The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;
3	WEB	Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
3	WEB	Esther	9	25	but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
3	WEB	Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim,{Purim is the Hebrew plural for pur, which means lot.} from the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,
3	WEB	Esther	9	27	the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;
3	WEB	Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their seed.
3	WEB	Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
3	WEB	Esther	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
3	WEB	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.
3	WEB	Esther	9	32	The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
3	WEB	Esther	10	1	King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.
3	WEB	Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness: but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	19	For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	21	For, seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	22	For both the Jews require signs: and the Greeks seek after wisdom.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	24	But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men: and the weakness of God is stronger than men. The foolishness, etc.... That is to say, what appears foolish to the world in the ways of God, is indeed most wise; and what appears weak is indeed above all the strength and comprehension of man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	26	For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	27	But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise: and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	28	And the base things of the world and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen: and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his sight.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	30	But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	1	31	That, as it is written: He that glorieth may glory in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 2 His preaching was not in loftiness of words, but in spirit and power. And the wisdom he taught was not to be understood by the worldly wise or sensual man, but only by the spiritual man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	2	For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ: and him crucified.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	5	That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew. For if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	9	But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	10	But to us God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God, no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	12	Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given us from God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	14	But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined. The sensual man—the spiritual man.... The sensual man is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason, sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man is he who, in the mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the church, which he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his church, and to direct her in all things by the Spirit of truth.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. 1 Corinthians Chapter 3 They must not contend about their teachers, who are but God’s ministers and accountable to him. Their works shall be tried by fire.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	3	For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to man?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith: I indeed am of Paul: and another: I am of Apollo: are you not men? What then is Apollo and what is Paul?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	5	The ministers of him whom you have believed: and to every one as the Lord hath given.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	6	I have planted, Apollo watered: but God gave the increase.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	7	Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	9	For we are God’s coadjutors. You are God’s husbandry: you are God’s building.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	12	Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble: Upon this foundation.... The foundation is Christ and his doctrine: or the true faith in him, working through charity. The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and precious stones, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the gospel; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the Corinthian teachers (who affected the pomp of words and human eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser sins. Now the day of the Lord, and his fiery trial, (in the particular judgment immediately after death,) shall make manifest of what sort every man’s work has been: of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of God’s judgment shall try every man’s work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the true faith and in the state of grace, though with some imperfection,) shall be saved yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	13	Every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	14	If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	15	If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	16	Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	17	But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	20	And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	21	Let no man therefore glory in men.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	22	For all things are yours, whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. For all are yours.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	23	And you are Christ’s. And Christ is God’s. 1 Corinthians Chapter 4 God’s ministers are not to be judged. He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	1	Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	2	Here now it is required among the dispensers that a man be found faithful.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man’s day. But neither do I judge my own self.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	4	For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	5	Therefore, judge not before the time: until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every man have praise from God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	6	But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	7	For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	8	You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honourable, but we without honour.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	12	And we labour, working with our own hands. We are reviled: and we bless. We are persecuted: and we suffer it.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	13	We are blasphemed: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest children.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	15	For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus: as I teach every where in every church.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	18	As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	21	What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in charity and in the spirit of meekness? 1 Corinthians Chapter 5 He excommunicates the incestuous adulterer and admonishes them to purge out the old leaven.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	1	It is absolutely heard that there is fornication among you and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens: that one should have his father’s wife.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	2	And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned: that he might be taken away from among you that hath done this thing.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	3	I indeed, absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	8	Therefore, let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	10	I mean not with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or the extortioners or the servers of idols: otherwise you must needs go out of this world.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator or covetous or a server of idols or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	13	For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves. 1 Corinthians Chapter 6 He blames them for going to law before unbelievers. Of sins that exclude from the kingdom of heaven. The evil of fornication.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the saints?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	2	Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	3	Know you not that we shall judge angels? How much more things of this world?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	4	If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most despised in the church.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man that is able to judge between his brethren?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother: and that before unbelievers.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	7	Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? A fault.... Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	8	But you do wrong and defraud: and that to your brethren.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	9	Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: Neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	10	Nor the effeminate nor liers with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor railers nor extortioners shall possess the kingdom of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	11	And such some of you were. But you are washed: but you are sanctified: but you are justified: in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any. All things are lawful, etc.... That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	13	Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	14	Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	15	Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid!
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	16	Or know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	18	Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	19	Or know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God: and you are not your own?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	20	For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. 1 Corinthians Chapter 7 Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy. Virginity is preferable to a married state.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	2	But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every woman have her own husband. Have his own wife.... That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to marry: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are. (Ver. 7:8.) But he speaks here to them that are already married; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the marriage state.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	5	Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer: and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment. By indulgence.... That is, by a condescension to your weakness.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from God: one after this manner, and another after that.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt. If they do not contain, etc.... This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by vow, have given their first faith to God; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, God will never refuse the gift of continency. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, if they cannot contain.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	10	But to them that are married, not I, but the Lord, commandeth that the wife depart not from her husband.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	11	And if she depart, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	12	For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not put her away. I speak, not the Lord.... Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	13	And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not put away her husband.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife: and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband. Otherwise your children should be unclean: but now they are holy. Is sanctified.... The meaning is not, that the faith of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation; but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification, by bringing them to the true faith.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	16	For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	17	But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all churches I teach.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called, being circumcised? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	21	Wast thou called, being a bondman? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	23	You are bought with a price: be not made the bondslaves of men.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	25	Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	26	I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity: that it is good for a man so to be.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	28	But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	29	This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord: how he may please God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	33	But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	34	And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord: that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He sinneth not if she marry. Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc.... The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that persons may do what they will and not sin, provided they afterwards marry; but that the father, with regard to the giving his virgin in marriage, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no sin to him if she marry.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	37	For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	38	Therefore both he that giveth his virgin in marriage doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	39	A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her marry to whom she will: only in the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	40	But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the spirit of God. 1 Corinthians Chapter 8 Though an idol be nothing, yet things offered up to idols are not to be eaten, for fear of scandal.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up: but charity edifieth. Knowledge puffeth up, etc.... Knowledge, without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known by him.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	4	But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	5	For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many and lords many): Gods many, etc.... Reputed for such among the heathens.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	6	Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	7	But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol: and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	8	But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more: nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	10	For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	12	Now when you sin thus against the brethren and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother. If meat scandalize.... That is, if my eating cause my brother to sin. 1 Corinthians Chapter 9 The apostle did not make use of his power of being maintained at the charges of those to whom he preached, that he might give no hindrance to the gospel. Of running in the race and striving for the mastery.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	1	Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	2	And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	3	My defence with them that do examine me is this.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	4	Have not we power to eat and to drink?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister as well as the rest of the apostles and the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? A woman, a sister.... Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	7	Who serveth as a soldier, at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	8	Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say; these things?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	10	Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	13	Know you not that they who work in the holy place eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar partake with the altar?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	14	So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die rather than that any man should make my glory void.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me: for a necessity lieth upon me. For woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel. It is no glory.... That is, I have nothing to glory of.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	19	For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	20	And I became to the Jews a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	21	To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	23	And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be made partaker thereof.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	24	Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	25	And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things. And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible one.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	27	But I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway. I chastise, etc.... Here St. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires. 1 Corinthians Chapter 10 By the example of the Israelites, he shews that we are not to build too much upon favours received but to avoid their sins and fly from the service of idols and from things offered to idols.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	1	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud: and all passed through the sea.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	2	And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea: In Moses.... Under the conduct of Moses, they received baptism in figure, by passing under the cloud, and through the sea; and they partook of the body and blood of Christ in figure, by eating of the manna, (called here a spiritual food because it was a figure of the true bread which comes down from heaven,) and drinking the water, miraculously brought out of the rock, called here a spiritual rock, because it was also a figure of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual food:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	4	And all drank the same spiritual drink: (And they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.)
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	5	But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things, as they also coveted.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	7	Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication: and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them tempted and perished by the serpents.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	10	Neither do you murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. The ends of the world.... That is, the last ages.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore, he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	13	Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. Or.... no temptation hath taken hold of you.... or come upon you as yet, but what is human, or incident to man. Issue.... or a way to escape.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	16	The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? Which we bless.... Here the apostle puts them in mind of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, ver. 21, that they who are made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils by eating of the meats sacrificed to them.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	17	For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread. One bread.... or, as it may be rendered, agreeably both to the Latin and Greek, because the bread is one, all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread. For it is by our communicating with Christ, and with one another, in this blessed sacrament, that we are formed into one mystical body; and made, as it were, one bread, compounded of many grains of corn, closely united together.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel according to the flesh. Are not they that eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	19	What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? Or that the idol is any thing?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	20	But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	21	You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me: but all things are not expedient.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me: but all things do not edify.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but that which is another’s.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat: asking no question for conscience’ sake.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	26	The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you be willing to go: eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols: do not eat of it, for his sake that told it and for conscience’ sake.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	29	Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	31	Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	32	Be without offence to the Jew, and to the Gentiles and to the church of God:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	33	As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself but to many: that they may be saved. 1 Corinthians Chapter 11 Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	1	Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man: and the head of Christ is God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraceth his head.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	7	The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	9	For the man was not created for the woman: but the woman for the man.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	10	Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels. A power.... that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	11	But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	13	You yourselves judge. Doth it become a woman to pray unto God uncovered?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the Church of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	17	Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	18	For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you. And in part I believe it.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you. There must be also heresies.... By reason of the pride and perversity of man’s heart; not by God’s will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	20	When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper. The Lord’s supper.... So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	21	For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	22	What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	24	And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my body, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	27	Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. Or drink.... Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink. Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc.... This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord’s body.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	28	But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. Drink of the chalice.... This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	30	Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	31	But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	32	But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	34	If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. 1 Corinthians Chapter 12 Of the diversity of spiritual gifts. The members of the mystical body, like those of the natural body, must mutually cherish one another.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say The Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	5	And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	7	And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	8	To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	9	To another, faith in the same spirit: to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles: to another, prophecy: to another, the discerning of spirits: to another, diverse kinds of tongues: to another, interpretation of speeches.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	11	But all these things, one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body: So also is Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free: and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	14	For the body also is not one member, but many.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: Is it therefore not of the body?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	18	But now God hath set the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	19	And if they all were one member, where would be the body?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help. Nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	22	Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body are more necessary.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	23	And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour: and those that are our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	24	But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	25	That there might be no schism in the body: but the members might be mutually careful one for another.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it: or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ and members of member.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	28	And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors: after that miracles: then the graces of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	30	Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	31	But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way. 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Charity is to be preferred before all gifts.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	2	And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	3	And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	4	Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely, is not puffed up,
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	5	Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	8	Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void or tongues shall cease or knowledge shall be destroyed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part: and we prophesy in part.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	12	We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I shall know even as I am known.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	13	And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity. 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 The gift of prophesying is to be preferred before that of speaking strange tongues.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	1	Follow after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy. Prophesy.... That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries. Not unto men.... Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and comfort.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	5	And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	6	But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in doctrine?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	10	There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	11	If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	12	So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church. Of spirits.... Of spiritual gifts.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	13	And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth: but my understanding is without fruit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding, I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	16	Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing? Because he knoweth not what thou sayest. Amen.... The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	17	For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	19	But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a tongue.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in malice be children: and in sense be perfect.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecies, not to unbelievers but to believers.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	26	How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	27	If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church and speak to himself and to God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	29	And let the prophets speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	30	But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	31	For you may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	34	Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the law saith.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	35	But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God come out from you? Or came it only unto you?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	37	If any seem to be a prophet or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	38	But if any man know not, he shall not be known.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy: and forbid not to speak with tongues.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	14	40	But let all things be done decently and according to order. 1 Corinthians Chapter 15 Christ’s resurrection and ours. The manner of our resurrection.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	1	Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	2	By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried: and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	6	Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	7	After that, he was seen by James: then by all the apostles.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	8	And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me hath not been void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	11	For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have believed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain: and your faith is also vain.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain: for you are yet in your sins.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	18	Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	21	For by a man came death: and by a man the resurrection of the dead.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	22	And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	23	But every one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ: then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	24	Afterwards the end: when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father: when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	26	And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	27	All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. The Son also himself shall be subject unto him.... That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise, what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then baptized for them? That are baptized for the dead.... Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	30	Why also are we in danger every hour?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	31	I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	32	If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Let us eat and drink, etc.... That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	33	Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	34	Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak it to your shame.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? Or with what manner of body shall they come?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	36	Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be: but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	40	And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	41	One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption: it shall rise in incorruption.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness: it shall rise in power.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	45	The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	46	Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	47	The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	48	Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	49	Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible. And we shall be changed.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	54	And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	55	O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	56	Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 1 Corinthians Chapter 16 Of collection of alms. Admonitions and salutations.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collections that are made for the saints: as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week, let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him: that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	3	And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	6	And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way: for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus, until Pentecost.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct ye him on his way in peace, that he may come to me. For I look for him with the brethren.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	12	And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye: stand fast in the faith: do manfully and be strengthened.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done in charity.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	15	And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	16	That you also be subject to such and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	17	And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha. Let him be anathema, maranatha.... Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, ‘The Lord is come’ already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha: ‘May our Lord come’, that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
4	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	16	24	My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	31	That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	23	And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	27	But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	20	But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	26	For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	29	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	33	Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	55	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done with charity.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
4	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	1	To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	2	from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	3	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	4	I always thank God for you. I thank him for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	5	For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	6	and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	7	There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	8	And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	9	God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	10	But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	12	I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	13	You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	14	I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	15	so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	16	I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	17	My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	18	The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are on the path to ruin, but to us who are on the path of salvation it is the power of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	19	For scripture says –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	21	For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	22	While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	23	we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	24	but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	25	For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	26	Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	27	but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	28	and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	29	so that in his presence no one should boast.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	30	But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	1	31	so that – in the words of scripture –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	1	For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	2	for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything except Jesus Christ – and him crucified!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	3	Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	4	My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	6	Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	7	No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	8	This philosophy is clearly not known to any of the leaders of today, since, had they known it, they would never have crucified our glorious Lord!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	9	It is what scripture speaks of as –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	10	Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	11	For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	12	And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	13	And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	14	The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	15	But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	2	16	For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	1	But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	3	While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	4	When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	5	What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	7	Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	8	In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	10	In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	11	for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	12	Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	13	the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	14	If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	15	If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	16	Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	17	If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	19	For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	20	And it says again –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	3	23	But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	1	Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	2	Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	3	But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	4	for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	6	All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	7	For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	8	Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	9	For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	10	We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	11	To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	12	we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	13	we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	14	It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	15	Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	17	This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	18	Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	19	But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	20	for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	1	There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	2	Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	3	For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	4	I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	5	to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little yeast leavens all the dough?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	7	Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	8	therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	9	I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	10	not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	11	But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	12	What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	5	13	while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	1	Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	2	Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	3	Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	4	Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	5	Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	6	Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	7	To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	8	Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	9	Don’t you know that wrongdoers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	10	or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	11	Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	12	Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	13	Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	14	and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise us up also by the exercise of his power.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	15	Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	16	Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	17	while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	18	Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	19	Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	6	20	Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	1	With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	2	But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	3	A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	4	It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	6	I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	7	I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	8	My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	9	But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	10	To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	11	(If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	12	To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	13	and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	14	For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	15	However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	16	How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	17	In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	18	Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	20	Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	22	For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	24	Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	25	With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	26	I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	28	Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	29	What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	30	those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	33	while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	34	and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	35	I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter around your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	36	If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	37	On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	38	In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	7	40	Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	1	With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	2	If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	3	On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	4	With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	5	Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	6	Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	7	Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	8	What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	9	But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	10	For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	11	And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	12	In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	2	If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	3	The defense that I make to my critics is this:
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	4	Haven’t we a right to food and drink?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	5	Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	7	Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	8	Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	9	For in the Law of Moses it is said –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	10	Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the plowman ought not to plow, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	11	Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	12	If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	13	Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	14	So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	15	I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	16	If I proclaim the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not share it!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	17	If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	19	Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	21	To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	23	And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	24	Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	25	Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	26	I, therefore, do not run aimlessly. I do not box like a man hitting the air.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	9	27	No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	1	I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	2	that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	3	and that they all ate the same supernatural food,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	5	Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	7	Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	8	Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	9	Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by snakes.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	10	And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	11	These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	16	In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	17	The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	18	Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	19	What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	20	No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	21	You cannot drink both the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	22	Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	23	Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	24	A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	25	Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	26	for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	27	If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	28	But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	29	I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	30	If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	32	Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	10	33	for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	1	Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	2	I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	3	But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	4	Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonors him who is his head;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	5	while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonors him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	6	Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	7	A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	8	For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	9	Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	10	And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	11	Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	12	for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	14	Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	15	a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	16	If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	17	In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	18	To begin with, I am told that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you. In part I believe this,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	19	indeed, there must be parties among you, so that the people of real worth become known.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	20	When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	21	for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	22	Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	23	For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	24	and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said  “This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.”
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	25	And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying  “This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.”
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	26	For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offense against the Lord’s body and blood.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	28	Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	29	For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	30	That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	31	But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	32	Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	33	Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	1	In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	4	Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	5	ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	6	results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	7	To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	8	To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	10	to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	11	All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	12	For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	13	for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	14	The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	16	Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	17	If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	18	But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	19	If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	20	But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	21	The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	22	No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	23	and those parts which we deem less honorable we surround with special honor; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	24	Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honor to the part that lacks it –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	25	As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	26	If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honor done to it, all the others share its joy.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	27	Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	28	In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	29	Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	30	Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	12	31	Strive for the greater gifts.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	1	Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	2	Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	3	Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	5	love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	6	love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	7	love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will end; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will vanish.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	9	For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	10	but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will end.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	12	As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	13	13	Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	1	Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	2	The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	3	But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	4	Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	6	This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	7	Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	8	If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	9	And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	11	If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	12	And so with you; since you are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ should pray for ability to interpret them.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	14	If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	15	What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	16	If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	17	Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	18	Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	19	But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	20	My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	21	It is said in the Law –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	22	Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	23	So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	24	While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	25	the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	26	What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	27	If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	28	If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	29	Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	30	But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	31	For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	32	(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	34	At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	35	If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	36	What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	38	Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	14	40	Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	1	Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	2	and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	3	For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	6	After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	7	After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	8	Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, a miscarried baby – born untimely.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	10	But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	12	Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	13	But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	14	and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	15	Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	16	For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	17	and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	18	Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	19	If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	20	But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	21	For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	22	For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	24	Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be overthrown is death;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	27	for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	28	And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	29	Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	30	Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	31	Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	32	If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	34	Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	35	Someone, however, may ask ‘How do the dead rise? And in what body will they come?’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	36	You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not come to life, unless it dies!
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	37	And when you sow, you sow not the body that will be, but a mere grain – perhaps of wheat, or something else.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	38	God gives it the body that he pleases – to each seed its special body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	39	All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	40	There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	41	There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	42	It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	43	sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	44	As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	45	That is what is meant by the words – ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	46	That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterward comes the spiritual;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	47	the first man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	48	Those who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who are of heaven are like him who came from heaven.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	50	This I say, friends – Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	51	Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	52	at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	54	And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	55	‘death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?’
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	56	It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin its power.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	1	With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	3	On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	4	and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	5	I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	6	And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	7	I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	8	I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	9	for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	10	If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	11	No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	12	As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	13	Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	14	Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	15	I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	16	I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	17	I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	18	they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	19	The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	20	All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	21	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	22	Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	23	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.
4	OEB	1 Corinthians	16	24	My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	2	to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	5	that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	7	so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	8	who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	10	Now I beg you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	11	For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are contentions among you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow Cephas, and, I follow Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided?  Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	15	so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	16	(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News-- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.{Isaiah 29:14}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the lawyer of this world?  Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	22	For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	26	For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	27	but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise.  God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	28	and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should boast before God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	30	But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	1	31	that, according as it is written, He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	1	When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	3	I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	4	My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	5	that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	6	We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this world has known.  For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear, which didn't enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him.{Isaiah 64:4}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	10	But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him?  Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	12	But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	14	Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	15	But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?{Isaiah 40:13} But we have Christ's mind.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	1	Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly.  For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	4	For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, aren't you fleshly?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted.  Apollos watered.  But God gave the increase.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	7	So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God's fellow workers.  You are God's farming, God's building.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	12	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	13	each man's work will be revealed.  For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	14	If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	15	If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	16	Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself.  If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written, He has taken the wise in their craftiness.{Job 5:13}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.{Psalm 94:11}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast in men.  For all things are yours,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	3	23	and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	1	So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	2	Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment.  Yes, I don't judge my own self.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing against myself.  Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts.  Then each man will get his praise from God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	6	Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	7	For who makes you different?  And what do you have that you didn't receive?  But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	8	You are already filled.  You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us.  Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	9	For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death.  For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.  You have honor, but we have dishonor.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	11	Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	12	We toil, working with our own hands.  When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we entreat.  We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	14	I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	15	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	16	I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	17	Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	20	For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you want?  Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	1	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	2	You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	3	For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	5	are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good.  Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened.  For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	10	yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	11	But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	5	13	But those who are outside, God judges.  Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.{Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	2	Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	3	Don't you know that we will judge angels?  How much more, things that pertain to this life?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	4	If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	5	I say this to move you to shame.  Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	7	Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another.  Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	8	No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	9	Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God?  Don't be deceived.  Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	11	Such were some of you, but you were washed.  But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	13	Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	14	Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	15	Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	16	Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, The two, says he, will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	18	Flee sexual immorality!  Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	19	Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God?  You are not your own,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	6	20	for you were bought with a price.  Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	2	But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	4	The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	5	Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	7	Yet I wish that all men were like me.  However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	9	But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	11	(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	13	The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	17	Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk.  So I command in all the assemblies.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called having been circumcised?  Let him not become uncircumcised.  Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	20	Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you called being a bondservant?  Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	22	For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man.  Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price.  Don't become bondservants of men.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	24	Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	26	I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife?  Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife?  Don't seek a wife.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry, you have not sinned.  If a virgin marries, she has not sinned.  Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	29	But I say this, brothers:  the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	32	But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	33	but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	34	There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world-- how she may please her husband.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	35	This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin.  Let them marry.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	38	So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols:  We know that we all have knowledge.  Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	2	But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	4	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	5	For though there are things that are called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many gods and many lords;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	7	However, that knowledge isn't in all men.  But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	8	But food will not commend us to God.  For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	9	But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	10	For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	11	And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	12	Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free?  Am I not an apostle?  Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord?  Aren't you my work in the Lord?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	4	Have we no right to eat and to drink?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	5	Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	6	Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	7	What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	8	Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} Is it for the oxen that God cares,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	10	or does he say it assuredly for our sake?  Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	13	Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	14	Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward?  That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	19	For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	21	to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	23	Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	24	Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize?  Run like that, that you may win.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	25	Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things.  Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	26	I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly.  I fight like that, as not beating the air,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	9	27	but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	1	Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	2	and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	3	and all ate the same spiritual food;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink.  For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	5	However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	7	Neither be idolaters, as some of them were.  As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.{Exodus 32:6}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	10	Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men.  Judge what I say.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, isn't it a communion of the body of Christ?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	18	Consider Israel according to the flesh.  Don't those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the altar?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	19	What am I saying then?  That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have communion with demons.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	21	You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  Are we stronger than he?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	25	Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	26	for the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness.{Psalm 24:1}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	27	But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	28	But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience.  For the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	29	Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	32	Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	10	33	even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	1	Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head.  For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	8	For man is not from woman, but woman from man;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	9	for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	10	For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	12	For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves.  Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	14	Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	17	But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	19	For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	20	When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	21	For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	22	What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have?  What shall I tell you?  Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	24	When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you.  Do this in memory of me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	25	In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	31	For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	33	Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	11	34	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment.  The rest I will set in order whenever I come.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathen{or Gentiles}, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, Jesus is accursed.  No one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	4	Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	5	There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	6	There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	9	to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	10	and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	11	But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot would say, Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body, it is not therefore not part of the body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	16	If the ear would say, Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body, it's not therefore not part of the body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	18	But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one member, where would the body be?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	20	But now they are many members, but one body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	21	The eye can't tell the hand, I have no need for you, or again the head to the feet, I have no need for you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	22	No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	23	Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	24	whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	26	When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	28	God has set some in the assembly:  first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healings?  Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	12	31	But earnestly desire the best gifts.  Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	3	If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	5	doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	6	doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails.  But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with.  Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	10	but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child.  Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	12	For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	13	13	But now faith, hope, and love remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	1	Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	2	For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	3	But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	4	He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy.  For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	6	But now, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	9	So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	11	If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	12	So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	15	What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.  I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	17	For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	19	However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	20	Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.{Isaiah 28:11-12}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	22	Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	25	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.  So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	26	What is it then, brothers?  When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation.  Let all things be done to build each other up.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	27	If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	31	For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	34	let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	36	What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	37	If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	1	Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	2	by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	6	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	8	and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am.  His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	14	If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	15	Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	17	If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	18	Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	19	If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead.  He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	21	For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order:  Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	24	Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	27	For, He put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:6} But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	28	When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	29	Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	30	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	31	I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	32	If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me?  If the dead are not raised, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.{Isaiah 22:13}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	33	Don't be deceived!  Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	34	Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge of God.  I say this to your shame.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say, How are the dead raised? and, With what kind of body do they come?
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	36	You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	37	That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.  It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul.{Genesis 2:7} The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	46	However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth, made of dust.  The second man is the Lord from heaven.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	48	As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	49	As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's{NU, TR read we will instead of let's} also bear the image of the heavenly.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	54	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen:  Death is swallowed up in victory.{Isaiah 25:8}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	55	Death, where is your sting?  Hades{or, Hell}, where is your victory?{Hosea 13:14}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	4	If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	6	But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	7	For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	9	for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	11	Therefore let no one despise him.  But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	13	Watch!  Stand firm in the faith!  Be courageous!  Be strong!
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	14	Let all that you do be done in love.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	15	Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	16	that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	17	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours.  Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	19	The assemblies of Asia greet you.  Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers greet you.  Greet one another with a holy kiss.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	21	This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	22	If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed{Greek: anathema.}. Come, Lord!{Aramaic: Maranatha!}
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
4	WEB	1 Corinthians	16	27	{See Romans 14:23} {TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27.}
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the word of life.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	For the life was manifested: and we have seen and do bear witness and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father and hath appeared to us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you: that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice and your joy may be full.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him and declare unto you: That God is light and in him there is no darkness.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another: And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar: and his word is not in us. 1 John Chapter 2 Christ is our advocate. We must keep his commandments and love one another. We must not love the world nor give ear to new teachers, but abide by the spirit of God in the church.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	1	My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	3	And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. We have known him, if we keep his commandments.... He speaks of that practical knowledge by love and affection, which can only be proved by our keeping his commandments; and without which we can not be said to know God as we should do.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	4	He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar: and the truth is not in him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	5	But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected. And by this we know that we are in him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	7	Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	8	Again a new commandment I write unto you: which thing is true both in him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light now shineth. A new commandment.... Viz., the commandment of love, which was first given in the old law; but was renewed and extended by Christ. See John 13.34.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	9	He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light: and there is no scandal in him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth: because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	13	I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	14	I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	15	Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	16	For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	17	And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	18	Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. It is the last hour.... That is, it is the last age of the world. Many Antichrists; ... that is, many heretics, enemies of Christ and his church, and forerunners of the great Antichrist.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	19	They went out from us but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us: but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. They were not of us.... That is, they were not solid, steadfast, genuine Christians: otherwise they would have remained in the church.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	20	But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things. The unction from the Holy One.... That is, grace and wisdom from the Holy Ghost. Know all things.... The true children of God’s church, remaining in unity, under the guidance of their lawful pastors, partake of the grace of the Holy Ghost, promised to the church and her pastors; and have in the church all necessary knowledge and instruction; so as to have no need to seek it elsewhere, since it can be only found in that society of which they are members.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	21	I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	22	Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	24	As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	25	And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	26	These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	27	And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you: but as his unction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. You have no need, etc.... You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost; which these new teachers have no share in.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	28	And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	2	29	If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who doth justice is born of him. 1 John Chapter 3 Of the love of God to us. How we may distinguish the children of God and those of the devil. Of loving one another and of purity of conscience.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	1	Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	2	Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God: and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	3	And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity. And sin is iniquity. Iniquity.... transgression of the law.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	5	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and in him there is no sin.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: and whosoever sinneth hath not seen him nor known him. Sinneth not.... viz., mortally. See chap. 1.8.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	9	Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God. Committeth not sin.... That is, as long as he keepeth in himself this seed of grace, and this divine generation, by which he is born of God. But then he may fall from this happy state, by the abuse of his free will, as appears from Rom. 11.20-22; Cor. 9.27; and 10.12; Phil. 2.12; Apoc. 3.11.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	11	For this is the declaration which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother’s just.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	13	Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	16	In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	17	He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his brother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	19	In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall persuade our hearts.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	20	For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	21	Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	22	And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	23	And this is his commandment: That we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us. 1 John Chapter 4 What spirits are of God, and what are not. We must love one another, because God has loved us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	1	Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Try the spirits.... Viz., by examining whether their teaching be agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) He that knoweth God, heareth us [the pastors of the church]. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	2	By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: Every spirit which confesseth, etc.... Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient; but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished form the false.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	3	And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world. That dissolveth Jesus.... Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his divinity. He is now already in the world.... Not in his person, but in his spirit, and in his precursors.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	5	They are of the world. Therefore of the world they speak: and the world heareth them.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	6	We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	7	Dearly beloved, let us love one another: for charity is of God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God: for God is charity.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	9	By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	10	In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	11	My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	13	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	16	And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	17	In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	18	Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth is not perfected in charity. Fear is not in charity, etc.... Perfect charity, or love, banisheth human fear, that is, the fear of men; as also all perplexing fear, which makes men mistrust or despair of God’s mercy; and that kind of servile fear, which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome fear of God’s judgments, so often recomended in holy writ; nor that fear and trembling, with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2.12.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	19	Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	20	If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	4	21	And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother. 1 John Chapter 5 Of them that are born of God, and of true charity. Faith overcomes the world. Three that bear witness to Christ. Of faith in his name and of sin that is and is not to death.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. Is born of God.... That is, is justified, and become a child of God by baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere disposition to keep God’s holy law and commandments.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	2	In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	3	For this is the charity of God: That we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not heavy.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory which overcometh the world: Our faith. Our faith.... Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a faith that worketh by charity. Gal. 5.6
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth that Christ is the truth. Came by water and blood.... Not only to wash away our sins by the water of baptism, but by his own blood.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	7	And there are Three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	8	And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three are one. The spirit, and the water, and the blood.... As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ’s divinity; so the spirit, which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his humanity, and are one; that is, all agree in one testimony.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. He that believeth not the Son, etc.... By refusing to believe the testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal life is obtained and promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this lively confidence, that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in the manner we ought. And this we know, and have experience of, by having obtained the petitions that we have made.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	11	And this is the testimony that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life. He that hath not the Son hath not life.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	13	These things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life: you who believe in the name of the Son of God.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	14	And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	15	And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	16	He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death. For that I say not that any man ask. A sin which is not to death, etc.... It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin which is not to death, and a sin which is unto death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that is not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is unto death, and adds these words, for that I say not that any man ask, it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any man ask the remission: that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as St. John said before, ver. 14. Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures, that God desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be converted and live, Ezech. 33.11. Though men’s sins be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow, Isa. 3.18. It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved. There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault. A sin unto death.... Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	17	All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him and the wicked one toucheth him not.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	19	We know that we are of God and the whole world is seated in wickedness. And the whole world is seated in wickedness.... That is, a great part of the world. It may also signify, is under the wicked one, meaning the devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all the wicked. John 12.31.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come. And he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. And may be in his true Son. He is, or this is the true God, and life eternal.... Which words are a clear proof of Christ’s divinity, and as such made use of by the ancient fathers.
5	DRB	The First Epistle of St. John the Apostle	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. Keep yourselves from idols.... An admonition to the newly converted Christians, lest conversing with heathens and idolaters, they might fall back into the sin of idolatry, which may be the sin unto death here mentioned by St. John.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)

5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.

5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	15	Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	16	Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	17	But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	19	We love him, because he first loved us.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	4	21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	8	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
5	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
5	OEB	1 John	1	1	We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.
5	OEB	1 John	1	2	That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.
5	OEB	1 John	1	3	It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
5	OEB	1 John	1	4	We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete.
5	OEB	1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.
5	OEB	1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.
5	OEB	1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
5	OEB	1 John	1	8	If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
5	OEB	1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing.
5	OEB	1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us.
5	OEB	1 John	2	1	My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father – Jesus Christ, the righteous.
5	OEB	1 John	2	2	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world.
5	OEB	1 John	2	3	It is by keeping God’s commands that we can be sure we know him.
5	OEB	1 John	2	4	Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.
5	OEB	1 John	2	5	But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:
5	OEB	1 John	2	6	whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.
5	OEB	1 John	2	7	Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard.
5	OEB	1 John	2	8	Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
5	OEB	1 John	2	9	The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.
5	OEB	1 John	2	10	The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.
5	OEB	1 John	2	11	The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.
5	OEB	1 John	2	12	Little children, I am writing to you
5	OEB	1 John	2	13	Parents, I am writing to you
5	OEB	1 John	2	14	Parents, I write to you
5	OEB	1 John	2	15	Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them.
5	OEB	1 John	2	16	For all that the world can offer – the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth – belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.
5	OEB	1 John	2	17	And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God’s will remain for ever.
5	OEB	1 John	2	18	My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour.
5	OEB	1 John	2	19	These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us – if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us.
5	OEB	1 John	2	20	You, however, have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth.
5	OEB	1 John	2	21	I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth.
5	OEB	1 John	2	22	Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist – one who rejects the Father and the Son.
5	OEB	1 John	2	23	No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also.
5	OEB	1 John	2	24	As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.
5	OEB	1 John	2	25	And this is what he himself promised us – eternal life!
5	OEB	1 John	2	26	In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.
5	OEB	1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him.
5	OEB	1 John	2	28	Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn’t fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming.
5	OEB	1 John	2	29	Since you know he is righteous, you realize that everyone who does what is right is his child.
5	OEB	1 John	3	1	See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be called God’s children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it has not learned to know him.
5	OEB	1 John	3	2	Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.
5	OEB	1 John	3	3	And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.
5	OEB	1 John	3	4	Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.
5	OEB	1 John	3	5	You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.
5	OEB	1 John	3	6	No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.
5	OEB	1 John	3	7	My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
5	OEB	1 John	3	8	The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.
5	OEB	1 John	3	9	No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.
5	OEB	1 John	3	10	By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.
5	OEB	1 John	3	11	For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one another.
5	OEB	1 John	3	12	We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.
5	OEB	1 John	3	13	Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you.
5	OEB	1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The person who does not love remains in a state of death.
5	OEB	1 John	3	15	The person who hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life dwelling within them.
5	OEB	1 John	3	16	This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. So we should lay down our own lives for each other.
5	OEB	1 John	3	17	If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?
5	OEB	1 John	3	18	My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be true and show itself in actions.
5	OEB	1 John	3	19	This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure ourselves in God’s presence:
5	OEB	1 John	3	20	though our conscience condemns us, God is greater than our conscience and knows everything.
5	OEB	1 John	3	21	Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,
5	OEB	1 John	3	22	and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his commands, and are doing what pleases him.
5	OEB	1 John	3	23	His command is that we should believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ commanded us.
5	OEB	1 John	3	24	The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he has given us.
5	OEB	1 John	4	1	Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
5	OEB	1 John	4	2	This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,
5	OEB	1 John	4	3	while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world!
5	OEB	1 John	4	4	You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
5	OEB	1 John	4	5	Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.
5	OEB	1 John	4	6	We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
5	OEB	1 John	4	7	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.
5	OEB	1 John	4	8	Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.
5	OEB	1 John	4	9	This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
5	OEB	1 John	4	10	This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
5	OEB	1 John	4	11	Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.
5	OEB	1 John	4	12	No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.
5	OEB	1 John	4	13	We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.
5	OEB	1 John	4	14	Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
5	OEB	1 John	4	15	Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.
5	OEB	1 John	4	16	And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us.
5	OEB	1 John	4	17	This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.
5	OEB	1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.
5	OEB	1 John	4	19	We love, because God first loved us.
5	OEB	1 John	4	20	If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
5	OEB	1 John	4	21	Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.
5	OEB	1 John	5	1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child.
5	OEB	1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.
5	OEB	1 John	5	3	For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,
5	OEB	1 John	5	4	for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith!
5	OEB	1 John	5	5	Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
5	OEB	1 John	5	6	Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood – not by water only but by water and blood – and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.
5	OEB	1 John	5	7	Indeed three testify:
5	OEB	1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree.
5	OEB	1 John	5	9	We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.
5	OEB	1 John	5	10	The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.
5	OEB	1 John	5	11	And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
5	OEB	1 John	5	12	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn’t have God’s Son does not have life.
5	OEB	1 John	5	13	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God’s Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
5	OEB	1 John	5	14	We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us.
5	OEB	1 John	5	15	And if we know he hears us – whatever we ask – we know also that what we ask for is ours.
5	OEB	1 John	5	16	If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.
5	OEB	1 John	5	17	All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
5	OEB	1 John	5	18	We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them.
5	OEB	1 John	5	19	We know that we are God’s children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
5	OEB	1 John	5	20	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God – and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
5	OEB	1 John	5	21	My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God.
5	WEB	1 John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life
5	WEB	1 John	1	2	(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);
5	WEB	1 John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us.  Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
5	WEB	1 John	1	4	And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.
5	WEB	1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
5	WEB	1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.
5	WEB	1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
5	WEB	1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
5	WEB	1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
5	WEB	1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
5	WEB	1 John	2	1	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.  If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
5	WEB	1 John	2	2	And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
5	WEB	1 John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.
5	WEB	1 John	2	4	One who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.
5	WEB	1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him.  This is how we know that we are in him:
5	WEB	1 John	2	6	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.
5	WEB	1 John	2	7	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.
5	WEB	1 John	2	8	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.
5	WEB	1 John	2	9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
5	WEB	1 John	2	10	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.
5	WEB	1 John	2	11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
5	WEB	1 John	2	12	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
5	WEB	1 John	2	13	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
5	WEB	1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
5	WEB	1 John	2	15	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.
5	WEB	1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.
5	WEB	1 John	2	17	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.
5	WEB	1 John	2	18	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.
5	WEB	1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.
5	WEB	1 John	2	20	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.
5	WEB	1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
5	WEB	1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
5	WEB	1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
5	WEB	1 John	2	24	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning.  If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.
5	WEB	1 John	2	25	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.
5	WEB	1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.
5	WEB	1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.
5	WEB	1 John	2	28	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
5	WEB	1 John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.
5	WEB	1 John	3	1	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!  For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.
5	WEB	1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be.  But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.
5	WEB	1 John	3	3	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
5	WEB	1 John	3	4	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.
5	WEB	1 John	3	5	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.
5	WEB	1 John	3	6	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.
5	WEB	1 John	3	7	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
5	WEB	1 John	3	8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
5	WEB	1 John	3	9	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.
5	WEB	1 John	3	10	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.  Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.
5	WEB	1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
5	WEB	1 John	3	12	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him?  Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
5	WEB	1 John	3	13	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
5	WEB	1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.  He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.
5	WEB	1 John	3	15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.
5	WEB	1 John	3	16	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
5	WEB	1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?
5	WEB	1 John	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and forever.  Amen.
5	WEB	1 John	3	18	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.
5	WEB	1 John	3	19	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,
5	WEB	1 John	3	20	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
5	WEB	1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;
5	WEB	1 John	3	22	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
5	WEB	1 John	3	23	This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.
5	WEB	1 John	3	24	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
5	WEB	1 John	4	1	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
5	WEB	1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
5	WEB	1 John	4	3	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.
5	WEB	1 John	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
5	WEB	1 John	4	5	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
5	WEB	1 John	4	6	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
5	WEB	1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.
5	WEB	1 John	4	8	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.
5	WEB	1 John	4	9	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
5	WEB	1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins.
5	WEB	1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.
5	WEB	1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.
5	WEB	1 John	4	13	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
5	WEB	1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
5	WEB	1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
5	WEB	1 John	4	16	We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.
5	WEB	1 John	4	17	In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.
5	WEB	1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made perfect in love.
5	WEB	1 John	4	19	We love Him, because he first loved us.
5	WEB	1 John	4	20	If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
5	WEB	1 John	4	21	This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.
5	WEB	1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him.
5	WEB	1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.
5	WEB	1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.
5	WEB	1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world:  your faith.
5	WEB	1 John	5	5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
5	WEB	1 John	5	6	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
5	WEB	1 John	5	7	For there are three who testify{Only a few recent manuscripts add in heaven:  the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.  And there are three that testify on earth}:
5	WEB	1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.
5	WEB	1 John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.
5	WEB	1 John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
5	WEB	1 John	5	11	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
5	WEB	1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life.  He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.
5	WEB	1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
5	WEB	1 John	5	14	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.
5	WEB	1 John	5	15	And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
5	WEB	1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.
5	WEB	1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.
5	WEB	1 John	5	18	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.
5	WEB	1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
5	WEB	1 John	5	20	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, elect,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	2	According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	4	Unto an inheritance, incorruptible, and undefiled and that cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	5	Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	6	Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	7	That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	8	Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now though you see him not, you believe and, believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified;
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	11	Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ and the glories that should follow.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	12	To whom it was revealed that, not to themselves but to you, they ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you: the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	13	Wherefore, having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	14	As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former desires of your ignorance,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	15	But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all manner of conversation holy:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	16	Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	17	And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons, judgeth according to every one’s work: converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	18	Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	20	Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the last times for you:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	21	Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the dead and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	22	Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love, from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	24	For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel hath been preached unto you. 1 Peter Chapter 2 We are to lay aside all guile and go to Christ the living stone, and, as being now his people, walk worthily of him, with submission to superiors and patience under sufferings.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	1	Wherefore laying away all malice and all guile and dissimulations and envies and all detractions,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	2	As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	3	If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	4	Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen and made honourable by God:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	5	Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	6	Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him shall not be confounded.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	7	To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	8	And a stone of stumbling and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	9	But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	10	Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy: but now have obtained mercy.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	12	Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	13	Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	14	Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of the good.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	15	For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	16	As free and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	19	For this is thankworthy: if, for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	20	For what glory is it, if, committing sin and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently: this is thankworthy before God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	21	For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	23	Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not, but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	24	Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	25	For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. 1 Peter Chapter 3 How wives are to behave to their husbands. What ornaments they are to seek. Exhortations to divers Virtues.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	1	In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	2	Considering your chaste conversation with fear.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	3	Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	4	But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	5	For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	6	As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well and not fearing any disturbance.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	7	Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	8	And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	10	For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	11	Let him decline from evil and do good: Let him seek after peace and pursue it:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	12	Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	13	And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	14	But if also you suffer any thing for justice’ sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear: and be not troubled.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	15	But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	16	But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	17	For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer than doing ill.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	18	Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	19	In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison: Spirits that were in prison.... See here a proof of a third place, or middle state of souls: for these spirits in prison, to whom Christ went to preach, after his death, were not in heaven; nor yet in the hell of the damned: because heaven is no prison: and Christ did not go to preach to the damned.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	20	Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	21	Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Whereunto baptism, etc.... Baptism is said to be of the like form with the water by which Noe was saved, because the one was a figure of the other. Not the putting away, etc.... As much as to say, that baptism has not its efficacy, in order to salvation, from its washing away any bodily filth or dirt; but from its purging the conscience from sin, when accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party, to answer the interrogations made at that time, with relation to faith, the renouncing of Satan with all his works; and the obedience to God’s commandments.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	22	Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him. 1 Peter Chapter 4 Exhortations to cease from sin, to mutual charity, to do all for the glory of God, to be willing to suffer for Christ.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	1	Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sins:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	2	That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh, not after the desires of men but according to the will of God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	3	For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings and unlawful worshipping of idols.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them into the same confusion of riotousness: speaking evil of you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	5	Who shall render account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	6	For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: That they might be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh: but may live according to God, in the Spirit.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	7	But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore and watch in prayers.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	8	But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	9	Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	10	As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	11	If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any minister, let him do it, as of the power which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	12	Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you: as if some new thing happened to you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	13	But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	14	If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory and power of God, and that which is his Spirit resteth upon you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a railer or a coveter of other men’s things.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	16	But, if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed: but let him glorify God in that name.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	17	For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if at first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	18	And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Scarcely.... That is, not without much labour and difficulty; and because of the dangers which constantly surround, the temptations of the world, of the devil, and of our own corrupt nature.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	4	19	Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator. 1 Peter Chapter 5 He exhorts both priests and laity to their respective duties and recommends to all humility and watchfulness.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	1	The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself also an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre’s sake but voluntarily:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	3	Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	4	And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	5	In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another: for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	6	Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	7	Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	8	Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	9	Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls, your brethren who are in the world.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you and confirm you and establish you.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	11	To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	12	By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	13	The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you. And so doth my son, Mark.
6	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	5	14	Salute one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	4	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	5	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	7	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	8	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	14	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	15	But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	18	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	20	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	21	Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	24	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	1	25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	4	To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	5	Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	9	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	10	Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	16	As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	20	For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	2	25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	2	While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	4	But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	8	Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	11	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	14	But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	17	For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	3	22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	2	That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	10	As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	11	If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	13	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	4	19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	3	Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.
6	KJV	The First Epistle General of Peter	5	14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	1	To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	2	and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	4	given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	5	for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	6	At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	7	that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	8	Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	9	as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	10	It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	11	as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	12	And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	13	Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	14	Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	15	but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	16	For scripture says –
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	17	And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	18	For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	19	but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	20	Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	21	who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	22	Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	23	since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	24	For –
6	OEB	1 Peter	1	25	but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	1	Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	2	like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	3	since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	4	Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	5	and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	6	For there is a passage of scripture that runs –
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	7	It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	8	and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	9	But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	10	Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	11	Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	12	Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evildoers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	13	Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	14	and to governors as sent by him to punish evildoers and to commend those who do right.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	15	For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	16	Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	17	Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	18	Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	19	For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	20	What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	21	For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	22	He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	23	He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	24	And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	2	25	Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	1	Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	2	as they see your pure, reverent conduct.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	3	Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	4	but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	5	It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	6	as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	7	Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	8	Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	9	never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing!
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	10	‘The person who wants to enjoy life
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	11	they should turn from evil and do good,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	13	Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	14	Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	15	Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	16	and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	17	It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	18	For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	19	And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	20	who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	21	And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
6	OEB	1 Peter	3	22	who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	1	Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	2	and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	3	Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	4	And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	5	But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	6	For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	8	Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	9	Never grudge hospitality to one another.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	10	Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	11	When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	12	Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	13	No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	14	If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	15	I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	16	But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name.
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	18	If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’
6	OEB	1 Peter	4	19	Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	1	As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	2	I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	3	not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	4	Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	5	Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	7	laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	8	Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	9	Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	10	God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	11	To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	12	I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	13	Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.
6	OEB	1 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with the kiss of love.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood:  Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	4	to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	5	who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	6	Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	7	that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	8	whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	9	receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	10	Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	11	searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	12	To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	13	Therefore, prepare your minds for action,{literally, gird up the waist of your mind} be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	14	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	15	but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	16	because it is written, You shall be holy; for I am holy.{Leviticus 11:44-45}
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	17	If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	18	knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	19	but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	20	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	21	who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	22	Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	23	having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	24	For, All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass.  The grass withers, and its flower falls;
6	WEB	1 Peter	1	25	but the Lord's word endures forever.{Isaiah 40:6-8} This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	1	Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	2	as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	3	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	4	coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	5	You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	6	Because it is contained in Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	7	For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,{Psalm 118:22}
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	8	and, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.{Isaiah 8:14} For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	10	who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	11	Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	12	having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	13	Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:  whether to the king, as supreme;
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	14	or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	15	For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	16	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	17	Honor all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God. Honor the king.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	18	Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	19	For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	20	For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	21	For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you{TR reads us instead of you} an example, that you should follow his steps,
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	22	who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.{Isaiah 53:9}
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	23	Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back.  When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	24	who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
6	WEB	1 Peter	2	25	For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer{Overseer is from the Greek episkopon, which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent.} of your souls.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	1	In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any don't obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	2	seeing your pure behavior in fear.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	3	Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	4	but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	5	For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	7	You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	8	Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	10	For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	11	Let him turn away from evil, and do good.  Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.{Psalm 34:12-16}
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	13	Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed.  Don't fear what they fear, neither be troubled.{Isaiah 8:12}
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	16	having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good manner of life in Christ.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	17	For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	18	Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	19	in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	20	who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	21	This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-- not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
6	WEB	1 Peter	3	22	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	2	that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	3	For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	4	They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	5	who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	6	For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is near.  Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	8	And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	10	As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.  Amen.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	12	Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	13	But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	14	If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	16	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God.  If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God?
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	18	If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?{Proverbs 11:31}
6	WEB	1 Peter	4	19	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	1	I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	2	Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	3	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	4	When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	5	Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	7	casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	8	Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful.  Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	9	Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	10	But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	11	To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.  Amen.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.
6	WEB	1 Peter	5	20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all: making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing,
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	3	Being mindful of the work of your faith and labour and charity: and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	6	And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	7	So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	8	For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2 The sincerity of the apostle’s preaching the gospel to them and of their receiving it.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	1	For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	2	But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	5	For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	6	Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	7	Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	8	So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame we have been to you that have believed:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	11	As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	12	We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	13	Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	16	Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end. To fill up their sins.... That is, to fill up the measure of their sins, after which God’s justice would punish them. For the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.... That is, to continue on them to the end.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	18	For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and joy. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3 The apostle’s concern and love for the Thessalonians.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	1	For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	2	And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	4	For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations: as also it is come to pass, and you know.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be made vain.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	8	Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	13	To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to purity and mutual charity. He treats of the resurrection of the dead.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	1	For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus that, as you have received from us, how you ought to walk and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should abstain from fornication:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour,
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	6	And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before and have testified.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	10	For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	11	And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your own business and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any man’s.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	12	And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	13	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	14	For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	15	For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ shall rise first.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	16	Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air: and so shall we be always with the Lord.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	4	17	Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5 The day of the Lord shall come when least expected. Exhortations to several duties.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	1	But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you:
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	5	For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we are not of the night nor of darkness.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be sober.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast plate of faith and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	11	For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you also do.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you;
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	13	That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have peace with them.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	14	And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the feeble minded: support the weak: be patient towards all men. The unquiet.... That is, such as are irregular and disorderly.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil to any man: but ever follow that which is good towards each other and towards all men.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	16	Always rejoice.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	18	In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	19	Extinguish not the spirit.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophecies.
7	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	5	21	But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.

7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	20	For ye are our glory and joy.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	2	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	6	That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	17	Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice evermore.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	19	Quench not the Spirit.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophesyings.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
7	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	1	To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	2	We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	3	recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	4	Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	5	because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	6	And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	7	and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	8	For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	9	Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	1	10	and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	1	Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	2	For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	3	Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	4	But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	5	Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	6	Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	8	In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s good news, but our lives as well – so dear had you become to us.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	9	You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	10	You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	11	Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	12	so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	13	This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	16	for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	17	As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	18	That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	19	For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	2	20	You are our pride and our delight!
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	1	And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	3	so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	4	For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	5	Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	6	But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	7	on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	8	For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	9	How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	11	May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	12	And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	3	13	and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	1	Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	4	each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	5	and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	6	none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God does not call us to an impure life, but demands holiness.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	9	As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	10	and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	11	Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	12	so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	13	We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	14	For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	15	This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	16	For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	17	Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterward we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	1	But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	2	You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	3	When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	4	You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	5	For you all are children of light and children of the day.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	7	It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	10	that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	12	We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are your leaders in the Lord’s service, and give you counsel.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	13	Hold them in the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live at peace with one another.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	14	We entreat you also, friends – warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with everyone.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	15	Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with everyone.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	16	Always be joyful;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	17	never cease to pray;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	18	under all circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made known in Christ Jesus.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	19	Do not quench the Spirit;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	20	do not make light of preaching.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	21	Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good;
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	22	shun every form of evil.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	23	May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	24	He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	25	Friends, pray for us.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the Lord’s followers with a sacred kiss.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	27	I order you in the Lord’s name to have this letter read to all the brethren.
7	OEB	1 Thessalonians	5	28	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	2	We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	4	We know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} loved by God, that you are chosen,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	5	and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	6	You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	8	For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	1	For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	2	but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	4	But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	5	For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	8	Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	11	As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	12	to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary to all men;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always.  But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	18	because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again-- but Satan hindered us.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} at his coming?
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and our joy.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	1	Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	3	that no one be moved by these afflictions.  For you know that we are appointed to this task.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	4	For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	6	But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	7	for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	10	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	12	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	3	13	to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	1	Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God:  your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	4	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	5	not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	6	that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you.  For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	10	for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia.  But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	11	and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we charged you;
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	12	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	13	But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	15	For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	18	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand:  remember my bonds. Grace be with you.  Amen.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	1	But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	3	For when they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	5	You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	6	so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	10	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	12	But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	13	and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	14	We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice always.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	18	In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	19	Don't quench the Spirit.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	20	Don't despise prophesies.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	21	Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from every form of evil.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	23	May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	24	He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	25	Brothers, pray for us.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
7	WEB	1 Thessalonians	5	27	I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	3	As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	4	Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which furnish questions rather than the edification of God which is in faith.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	6	From which things some, going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law: understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	9	Knowing this: That the law is not made for the just man but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, The law is not.... He means, that the just man doth good, and avoideth evil, not as compelled by the law, and merely for fear of the punishment appointed for transgressors; but voluntarily, and out of the love of God and virtue; and would do so, though there were no law.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	10	For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	11	Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God which hath been committed to my trust.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	12	I give him thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	13	Who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	14	Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	15	A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	16	But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	17	Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	18	This precept, I commend to thee, O son Timothy: according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	19	Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 1 Timothy Chapter 2 Prayers are to be said for all men, because God wills the salvation of all. Women are not to teach.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	1	I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	2	For kings and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	5	For there is one God: and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: One mediator.... Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times. A redemption for all.... He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle (I say the truth, I lie not), a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	9	In like manner, women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	10	But, as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence. 2:13.For Adam was first formed; then Eve.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not seduced; but the woman, being seduced, was in the transgression.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	2	15	Yet she shall be saved through child bearing; if she continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety. 1 Timothy Chapter 3 What sort of men are to be admitted into the clergy. The church is the pillar of truth.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	1	A faithful saying: If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	2	It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher, Of one wife.... The meaning is not that every bishop should have a wife (for St. Paul himself had none), but that no one should be admitted to the holy orders of bishop, priest, or deacon, who had been married more than once.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	5	But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	6	Not a neophyte: lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil. A neophyte.... That is, one lately baptized, a young convert.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	7	Moreover, he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	8	Deacons in like manner: chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	11	The women in like manner: chaste, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in all things.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children and their own houses.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	13	For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a good degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	14	These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee shortly.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. The pillar and ground of the truth.... Therefore the church of the living God can never uphold error, nor bring in corruptions, superstition, or idolatry.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	3	16	And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory. 1 Timothy Chapter 4 He warns him against heretics, and exhorts him to the exercise of piety.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	1	Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of devils,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have known the truth. Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats.... He speaks of the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Eneratites, the Manicheans, and other ancient heretics, who absolutely condemned marriage, and the use of all kind of meat; because they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. Whereas the church of God, so far from condemning marriage, holds it a holy sacrament; and forbids it to none but such as by vow have chosen the better part: and prohibits not the use of any meats whatsoever in proper times and seasons; though she does not judge all kind of diet proper for days of fasting and penance.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	6	These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	7	But avoid foolish and old wives fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	9	A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	10	For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	13	Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	16	Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee. 1 Timothy Chapter 5 He gives him lessons concerning widows, and how he is to behave to his clergy.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	1	An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	2	Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her parents; for this is acceptable before God.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	5	But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	6	For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	7	And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	8	But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	10	Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	12	Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith. Their first faith.... Their vow, by which they had engaged themselves to Christ.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	13	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	14	I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	16	If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	17	Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	19	Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	20	Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	21	I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	22	Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	23	Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent infirmities.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	24	Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	5	25	In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. 1 Timothy Chapter 6 Duties of servants. The danger of covetousness. Lessons for the rich.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	1	Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be blasphemed.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	2	But they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	5	Conflicts of men corrupted in mind and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	8	But having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	9	For they that will become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	10	For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.

8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	13	I charge thee before God who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	14	That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings and Lord of lords:
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality and inhabiteth light inaccessible: whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire everlasting. Amen.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	17	Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy)
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	18	To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to others,
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	19	To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called.
8	DRB	The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	6	21	Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	15	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	2	For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	1	This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	8	Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	11	Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	13	And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	21	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	24	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	14	That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
8	KJV	The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	2	To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	3	I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	4	nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	5	The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	6	And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	8	We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	9	by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	10	for the immoral, for perverts, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	11	as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	12	I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	13	though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	14	and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	15	How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’! And there is no greater sinner than I!
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	16	Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterward to believe on him and attain eternal life.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	17	To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	18	This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	19	with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	1	20	Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	1	First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	2	especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	3	This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	4	whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	5	There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	7	and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	8	My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	9	I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	10	but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	11	They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	12	I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	13	Adam was formed first, not Eve.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	14	And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	2	15	But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	1	How true is this saying:‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	2	The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	3	not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	4	they should provide for their own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	5	If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	6	The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	7	They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	8	So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	9	but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	10	They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	11	It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	12	Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	13	Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	14	I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	15	but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	3	16	Yes, and undeniably wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for –
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	2	who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	3	and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	4	Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	5	for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	6	Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	7	As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	8	for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	9	How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	10	With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	11	Remember these things in your teaching.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	12	Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	15	Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	4	16	Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	1	Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	2	the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	3	Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	4	But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	5	As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	6	But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	7	Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	8	Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	9	A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	10	and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	11	But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	12	and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	13	And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	14	Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	15	There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	16	Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	17	Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	18	The words of scripture are –
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	19	Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	20	but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	21	I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	22	Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrongdoing of others. Keep your life pure.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	23	Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	24	There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	5	25	In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	1	All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	3	Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	4	is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarreling, recriminations, base suspicions,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	5	and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	6	Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment!
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	8	So, with food and shelter, we will be content.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	9	Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	10	Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	11	But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	12	Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	13	I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	14	I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	15	This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	16	who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honor and power for ever. Amen.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	17	Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	18	Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	19	storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	20	Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall ‘theology,’
8	OEB	1 Timothy	6	21	for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my true child in faith:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	4	neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith--
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	5	but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	6	from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	9	as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	10	for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	11	according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	12	And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	13	although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	14	The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	15	The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	16	However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever.  Amen.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	1	20	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	1	I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	2	for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	4	who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	7	to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	9	In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	10	but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	12	But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	14	Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	2	15	but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	1	This is a faithful saying:  if a man seeks the office of an overseer{or, superintendents, or bishops}, he desires a good work.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	2	The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	3	not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	4	one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	5	(but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	6	not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	8	Servants{or, Deacons.}, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	10	Let them also first be tested; then let them serve{or, serve as deacons} if they are blameless.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	11	Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	12	Let servants{or, deacons} be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	13	For those who have served well{or, served well as deacons} gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	14	These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	15	but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	16	Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	2	through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	3	forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	6	If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives' fables.  Exercise yourself toward godliness.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	9	This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	10	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	14	Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	15	Be diligent in these things.  Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	4	16	Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	1	Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	2	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are widows indeed.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is{TR adds good and} acceptable in the sight of God.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	5	Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	6	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	7	Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	8	But if anyone doesn't provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	9	Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	10	being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	11	But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	12	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	13	Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	14	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	15	For already some have turned aside after Satan.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	17	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} And, The laborer is worthy of his wages.{Luke 10:7; Leviticus 19:13}
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	19	Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	20	Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	21	I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	22	Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins.  Keep yourself pure.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	23	Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	24	Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	5	25	In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	1	Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	4	he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	5	constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.{NU omits Withdraw yourself from such.}
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can't carry anything out.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	8	But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	9	But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	11	But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith.  Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	13	I charge you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	14	that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	15	which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	16	who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see:  to whom be honor and eternal power.  Amen.
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	17	Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;
8	WEB	1 Timothy	6	18	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead:
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	5	To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	6	I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	7	Which is not another: only there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	9	As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	11	For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it of man: nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	14	And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles: immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	17	Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	18	Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter: and I tarried with him fifteen days.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	21	Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past doth now preach the faith which once he impugned.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me. Galatians Chapter 2 The apostle’s preaching was approved of by the other apostles. The Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	1	Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	2	And I went up according to revelation and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles: but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	4	But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	5	To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	6	But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man): for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision. The gospel of the uncircumcision.... The preaching of the gospel to the uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles. St. Paul was called in an extraordinary manner to be the apostle of the Gentiles; St. Peter, besides his general commission over the whole flock, (John 21. 15, etc.,) had a peculiar charge of the people of the circumcision, that is, of the Jews.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	8	(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	9	And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	10	Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. I withstood, etc.... The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul’s reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	12	For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	13	And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented: so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	15	We by nature are Jews: and not of the Gentiles, sinners.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	16	But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid!
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	19	For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God; with Christ I am nailed to the cross.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	20	And I live, now not I: but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself for me.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	2	21	I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain. Galatians Chapter 3 The Spirit, and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law, but by faith.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	1	O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth: before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	5	He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you: doth he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of the faith?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	6	As it is written: Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	7	Know ye, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	9	Therefore, they that are of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one that abideth, not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	11	But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	12	But the law is not of faith: but he that doth those things shall live in them.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us (for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree).
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	15	Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to it.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	16	To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And to his seeds as of many. But as of one: And to thy seed, which is Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	17	Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	19	Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Because of transgressions.... To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats. Ordained by angels.... The law was delivered by angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the mediator, on this occasion, between God and the people.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	21	Was the law then against the promises of God: God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe. Hath concluded all under sin.... that is, hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	23	But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ: that we might be justified by faith. Pedagogue.... That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	25	But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	26	For you are all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. Neither Jew, etc.... That is, no distinction of Jew, etc.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	3	29	And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise. Galatians Chapter 4 Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn sons of Abraham.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	1	Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. Under the elements, etc.... That is, under the first rudiments of religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and sacraments.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	5	That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	7	Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	8	But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature, are not gods.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	9	But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire to serve again?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	10	You observe days and months and times, and years. You observe days, etc.... He speaks not of the observation of the Lord’s day, or other Christian festivals; but either of the superstitious observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the Jewish festivals, to the observance of which, certain Jewish teachers sought to induce the Galatians.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	12	Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You have not injured me at all.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	13	And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	14	You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	15	Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	16	Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	17	They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	18	But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	20	And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	24	Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is Agar.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	25	For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is: and is in bondage with her children.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	26	But that Jerusalem which is above is free: which is our mother.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	27	For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was after the spirit: so also it is now.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	30	But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. Galatians Chapter 5 He exhorts them to stand to their Christian liberty. Of the fruits of the flesh and of the spirit.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	1	Stand fast and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	2	Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man circumcising himself that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	4	You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	5	For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by Charity.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	7	You did run well. What hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	9	A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	13	For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty. Only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh: but by charity of the spirit serve one another.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another: take heed you be not consumed one of another.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	16	I say then: Walk in the spirit: and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh: For these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest: which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	21	Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	23	Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	5	26	Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. Galatians Chapter 6 He exhorts to charity, humility and all virtue. He glories in nothing but in the cross of Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	1	Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another’s burdens: and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	3	For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	4	But let every one prove his own work: and so he shall have glory in himself only and not in another.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	5	For every one shall bear his own burden.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	6	And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived: God is not mocked.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	8	For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	9	And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	10	Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	11	See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	12	For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law: but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but a new creature.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	16	And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them and mercy: and upon the Israel of God.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.
9	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	5	To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	9	As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	14	And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	9	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	17	And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	19	Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	1	Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	17	They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	8	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
9	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	1	To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;
9	OEB	Galatians	1	2	and from all the followers of the Lord here.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	3	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,
9	OEB	Galatians	1	4	gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of our God and Father,
9	OEB	Galatians	1	5	to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	6	I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’
9	OEB	Galatians	1	7	which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	8	Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!
9	OEB	Galatians	1	9	We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!
9	OEB	Galatians	1	10	Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	11	I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	12	I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	13	You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and tried to destroy it,
9	OEB	Galatians	1	14	and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	15	But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,
9	OEB	Galatians	1	16	saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,
9	OEB	Galatians	1	17	or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	18	Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	19	I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	20	(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).
9	OEB	Galatians	1	21	Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.
9	OEB	Galatians	1	22	But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;
9	OEB	Galatians	1	23	all that they had heard was – ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once tried to destroy.’
9	OEB	Galatians	1	24	And they praised God for my sake.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	1	Fourteen years afterward I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	2	It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	3	Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	4	But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –
9	OEB	Galatians	2	5	Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!
9	OEB	Galatians	2	6	Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	7	On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	8	For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	9	Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	10	Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	11	But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	12	Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	14	But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”
9	OEB	Galatians	2	15	We, though we are Jews by birth and not sinners of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	16	So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	17	If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be sinners, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!
9	OEB	Galatians	2	18	For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	19	I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
9	OEB	Galatians	2	21	I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die!
9	OEB	Galatians	3	1	Foolish Galatians! Who has been enchanting you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?
9	OEB	Galatians	3	2	Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?
9	OEB	Galatians	3	3	Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?
9	OEB	Galatians	3	4	Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose!
9	OEB	Galatians	3	5	He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?
9	OEB	Galatians	3	6	It is just as it was with Abraham –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	7	You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	8	And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	9	And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	10	All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	11	Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	12	But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	13	Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says –
9	OEB	Galatians	3	14	And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	15	To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	16	Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	17	My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	18	If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	19	What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrongdoings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	20	Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	21	Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	22	But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	23	Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	24	Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	26	For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	28	All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.
9	OEB	Galatians	3	29	And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	1	My point is this – as long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	2	He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	3	And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;
9	OEB	Galatians	4	4	but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –
9	OEB	Galatians	4	5	to ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	6	And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – ‘Abba, our Father.’
9	OEB	Galatians	4	7	You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	8	Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?
9	OEB	Galatians	4	10	You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years!
9	OEB	Galatians	4	11	You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	12	I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	13	You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	14	And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself!
9	OEB	Galatians	4	15	What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!
9	OEB	Galatians	4	16	Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?
9	OEB	Galatians	4	17	Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	18	It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –
9	OEB	Galatians	4	19	you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	20	But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?
9	OEB	Galatians	4	22	Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	23	But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	24	This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	25	Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and represents the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	27	For scripture says –
9	OEB	Galatians	4	28	As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	29	Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.
9	OEB	Galatians	4	30	But what does the passage of scripture say?
9	OEB	Galatians	4	31	And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	1	It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	2	Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	3	I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	4	You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	5	For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	6	If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	7	You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?
9	OEB	Galatians	5	8	The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	9	A little yeast leavens all the dough.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	10	I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	11	If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle!
9	OEB	Galatians	5	12	I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	13	Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only, do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence but serve one another in a loving spirit.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	14	Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept –
9	OEB	Galatians	5	15	But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	16	This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	17	For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	18	But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	19	The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,
9	OEB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
9	OEB	Galatians	5	21	feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	23	Against such things there is no law!
9	OEB	Galatians	5	24	And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	25	Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.
9	OEB	Galatians	5	26	Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	1	My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	2	Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	3	If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	4	Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;
9	OEB	Galatians	6	5	for everyone must bear their own load.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	6	The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	8	For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	9	Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	10	Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the household of the faith.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	11	See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	12	The people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are the people who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances. They do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ
9	OEB	Galatians	6	13	Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	14	But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	16	May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	17	For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
9	OEB	Galatians	6	18	May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
9	WEB	Galatians	1	2	and all the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
9	WEB	Galatians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
9	WEB	Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father--
9	WEB	Galatians	1	5	to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	6	I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different good news;
9	WEB	Galatians	1	7	and there isn't another good news.  Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	8	But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any good news other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	9	As we have said before, so I now say again:  if any man preaches to you any good news other than that which you received, let him be cursed.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God?  Or am I striving to please men?  For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	11	But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	14	I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	15	But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,
9	WEB	Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,
9	WEB	Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia.  Then I returned to Damascus.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	19	But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	20	Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	21	Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	22	I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,
9	WEB	Galatians	1	23	but they only heard:  He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.
9	WEB	Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	1	Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	2	I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	4	This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
9	WEB	Galatians	2	5	to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	6	But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,
9	WEB	Galatians	2	7	but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision
9	WEB	Galatians	2	8	(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);
9	WEB	Galatians	2	9	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	12	For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?
9	WEB	Galatians	2	15	We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,
9	WEB	Galatians	2	16	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	17	But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!
9	WEB	Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	19	For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me.  That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.
9	WEB	Galatians	2	21	I don't make void the grace of God.  For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!
9	WEB	Galatians	3	1	Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?
9	WEB	Galatians	3	2	I just want to learn this from you.  Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
9	WEB	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish?  Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?
9	WEB	Galatians	3	4	Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
9	WEB	Galatians	3	5	He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
9	WEB	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	7	Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations will be blessed.{Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18}
9	WEB	Galatians	3	9	So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.{Deuteronomy 27:26}
9	WEB	Galatians	3	11	Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, The righteous will live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}
9	WEB	Galatians	3	12	The law is not of faith, but, The man who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}
9	WEB	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.  For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,{Deuteronomy 21:23}
9	WEB	Galatians	3	14	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	15	Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, To seeds, as of many, but as of one, To your seed,{Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7} which is Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	17	Now I say this.  A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	19	What then is the law?  It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	22	But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	24	So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	26	For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
9	WEB	Galatians	3	29	If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	1	But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;
9	WEB	Galatians	4	2	but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,
9	WEB	Galatians	4	5	that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	6	And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba,{Abba is a Greek spelling for the Aramaic word for Father or Daddy used in a familiar, respectful, and loving way.} Father!
9	WEB	Galatians	4	7	So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	8	However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?
9	WEB	Galatians	4	10	You observe days, months, seasons, and years.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	12	I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are.  You did me no wrong,
9	WEB	Galatians	4	13	but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	14	That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	15	What was the blessing you enjoyed?  For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	16	So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
9	WEB	Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek you in no good way.  No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	18	But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--
9	WEB	Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?
9	WEB	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	23	However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	24	These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	25	For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband.{Isaiah 54:1}
9	WEB	Galatians	4	28	Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	29	But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
9	WEB	Galatians	4	30	However what does the Scripture say?  Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman.{Genesis 21:10}
9	WEB	Galatians	4	31	So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	1	Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	2	Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	3	Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	4	You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law.  You have fallen away from grace.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	5	For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	7	You were running well!  Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
9	WEB	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	9	A little yeast grows through the whole lump.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way.  But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	11	But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted?  Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	13	For you, brothers, were called for freedom.  Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}
9	WEB	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
9	WEB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
9	WEB	Galatians	5	21	envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,{or, faithfulness}
9	WEB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.
9	WEB	Galatians	5	26	Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	1	Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	2	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	3	For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	4	But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	5	For each man will bear his own burden.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	6	But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	7	Don't be deceived.  God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	8	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	9	Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	10	So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	13	For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	16	As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel.
9	WEB	Galatians	6	17	From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
9	WEB	Galatians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.  Amen.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	1	God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	2	In these days, hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory and the figure of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high: The figure ... that is, the express image, and most perfect resemblance. Making purgation.... That is, having purged away our sins by his passion.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels hath he said at any time: Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	7	And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	8	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	10	And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish: but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. But thou art the selfsame: and thy years shall not fail.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation? Hebrews Chapter 2 The transgression of the precepts of the Son of God is far more condemnable than of those of the Old Testament given by angels.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	1	Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	5	For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	7	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of thy hands.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God he might taste death for all.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	10	For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion. Perfect by his passion.... By suffering, Christ was to enter into his glory, Luke 24.26, which the apostle here calls being made perfect.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	12	I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	13	And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	14	Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	15	And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	16	For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold. No where doth he, etc.... That is, he never took upon him the nature of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	2	18	For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he is able to succour them also that are tempted. Hebrews Chapter 3 Christ is more excellent than Moses. Wherefore we must adhere to him by faith and obedience.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	2	Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater honour than the house.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things is God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	6	But Christ, as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the desert,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	10	Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	11	As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	12	Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	15	While it is said: To day, if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	16	For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	3	19	And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief. Hebrews Chapter 4 The Christian’s rest. We are to enter into it through Jesus Christ.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore lest, the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	2	For unto us also it hath been declared in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	3	For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	4	For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	6	Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached did not enter because of unbelief:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	7	Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David; To day, after so long a time as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest he would never have afterwards spoken of another day. Jesus.... Josue, who in Greek is called Jesus.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	11	Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and effectual and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	14	Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	15	For we have not a high priest who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	4	16	Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid. Hebrews Chapter 5 The office of a high priest. Christ is our high priest.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	3	And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	4	Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	5	So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	8	And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	9	And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	10	Called by God a high priest, according to the order of Melchisedech.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	12	For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	13	For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat is for the perfect: for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil. Hebrews Chapter 6 He warns them of the danger of falling by apostasy and exhorts them to patience and perseverance.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	1	Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect: not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works and of faith towards God, The word of the beginning.... The first rudiments of the Christian doctrine.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, It is impossible, etc.... The meaning is, that it is impossible for such as have fallen after baptism, to be again baptized; and very hard for such as have apostatized from the faith, after having received many graces, to return again to the happy state from which they fell.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	5	Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	6	And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	7	For the earth, that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	8	But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and very near unto a curse: whose end is to be burnt.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	9	But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered and do minister to the saints.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	12	That you become not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	13	For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	14	Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I shall multiply thee.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	15	And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, we who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	19	Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	6	20	Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. Hebrews Chapter 7 The priesthood of Christ according to the order of Melchisedech excels the Levitical priesthood and puts an end both to that and to the law.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever. Without father, etc.... Not that he had no father, etc., but that neither his father, nor his pedigree, nor his birth, nor his death, are set down in scripture.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	5	And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	6	But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the better.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	8	And here indeed, men that die receive tithes: but there, he hath witness that he liveth.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	9	And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedech met him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	11	If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech: and not be called according to the order of Aaron?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	16	Who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	18	There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	19	For the law brought nothing to perfection: but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it is not without an oath (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	21	But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever).
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	23	And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue: Many priests, etc.... The apostle notes this difference between the high priests of the law, and our high priest Jesus Christ; that they being removed by death, made way for their successors; whereas our Lord Jesus is a priest for ever, and hath no successor; but liveth and concurreth for ever with his ministers, the priests of the new testament, in all their functions. Also, that no one priest of the law, nor all of them together, could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting redemption, which our one high priest Jesus Christ has offered once, and for ever.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	24	But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	25	Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us. Make intercession.... Christ, as man, continually maketh intercession for us, by representing his passion to his Father.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath (which was since the law) the Son who is perfected for evermore. Hebrews Chapter 8 More of the excellence of the priesthood of Christ and of the New Testament.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. The holies.... That is, the sanctuary.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	4	If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law. If then he were on earth, etc.... That is, if he were not of a higher condition than the Levitical order of earthly priests, and had not another kind of sacrifice to offer, he should be excluded by them from the priesthood, and its functions, which by the law were appropriated to their tribe.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount. Who serve unto, etc.... The priesthood of the law and its functions were a kind of an example and shadow of what is done by Christ in his church militant and triumphant, of which the tabernacle was a pattern.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	6	But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament which is established on better promises.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	7	For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	8	For, finding fault with them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	10	For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind: and in their heart will I write them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord. For all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them. They shall not teach, etc.... So great shall be light and grace of the new testament, that it shall not be necessary to inculcate to the faithful the belief and knowledge of the true God, for they shall all know him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	12	Because I will be merciful to their iniquities: and their sins I will remember no more.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	8	13	Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old is near its end. A new.... Supply ‘covenant’. Hebrews Chapter 9 The sacrifices of the law were far inferior to that of Christ.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	1	The former indeed had also justifications of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks and the table and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the Holy.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	4	Having a golden censer and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna and the rod of Aaron that had blossomed and the tables of the testament.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	5	And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	6	Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle, the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	7	But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own and the people’s ignorance:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost signifying this: That the way into the Holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	9	Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	10	And divers washings and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction. Of correction.... Viz., when Christ should correct and settle all things.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	11	But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption. Eternal redemption.... By that one sacrifice of his blood, once offered on the cross, Christ our Lord paid and exhibited, once for all, the general price and ransom of all mankind: which no other priest could do.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer, being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	15	And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of necessity come in.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	20	Saying: This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	21	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	23	It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	24	For Jesus is not entered into the Holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into Heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the Holies every year with the blood of others: Offer himself often.... Christ shall never more offer himself in sacrifice, in that violent, painful, and bloody manner, nor can there be any occasion for it: since by that one sacrifice upon the cross, he has furnished the full ransom, redemption, and remedy for all the sins of the world. But this hinders not that he may offer himself daily in the sacred mysteries in an unbloody manner, for the daily application of that one sacrifice of redemption to our souls.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	26	For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world. But now once, at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	9	28	So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many. The second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation. To exhaust.... That is, to empty, or draw out to the very bottom, by a plentiful and perfect redemption. Hebrews Chapter 10 Because of the insufficiency of the sacrifices of the law, Christ our high priest shed his own blood for us, offering up once for all the sacrifice of our redemption. He exhorts them to perseverance.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	2	For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer. They would have ceased.... If they had been of themselves perfect to all the intents of redemption and remission, as Christ’s death is there would have been no occasion of so often repeating them: as there is no occasion for Christ’s dying any more for our sins.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	3	But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore, when he cometh into the world he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	6	Holocausts for sin did not please thee.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	7	Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	8	In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	9	Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: He taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	10	In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	11	And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	12	But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	14	For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	16	And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts and on their minds will I write them:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	18	Now, where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin. There is no more an oblation for sin.... Where there is a full remission of sins, as in baptism, there is no more occasion for a sin offering to be made for such sins already remitted; and as for sins committed afterwards, they can only be remitted in virtue of the one oblation of Christ’s death.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	20	A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	21	And a high priest over the house of God:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised):
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed: but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins: If we sin wilfully.... He speaks of the sin of wilful apostasy from the known truth; after which, as we can not be baptized again, we can not expect to have that abundant remission of sins, which Christ purchased by his death, applied to our souls in that ample manner as it is in baptism: but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful judgment; the more because apostates from the known truth, seldom or never have the grace to return to it.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	27	But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	28	A man making void the law of Moses dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	29	How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	32	But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	33	And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on them that were in bands and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	35	Do not therefore lose your confidence which hath a great reward.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	36	For patience is necessary for you: that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come will come and will not delay.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	38	But my just man liveth by faith: but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	10	39	But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul. Hebrews Chapter 11 What faith is. Its wonderful fruits and efficacy demonstrated in the fathers.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	1	Now, faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	2	For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God: that from invisible things visible things might be made.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts. And by it he being dead yet speaketh.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	5	By faith Henoch was translated that he should not see death: and he was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is: and is a rewarder to them that seek him.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house: by the which he condemned the world and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	8	By faith he that is called Abraham obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing whither he went. He that is called Abraham ... or, Abraham being called.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	9	By faith he abode in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city that hath foundations: whose builder and maker is God.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	11	By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive seed, even past the time of age: because she believed that he was faithful who had promised,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	12	For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	13	All these died according to faith, not having received the promises but beholding them afar off and saluting them and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	14	For they that say these things do signify that they seek a country.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they had doubtless, time to return.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	18	(To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called:)
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Whereupon also he received him for a parable. For a parable.... That is, as a figure of Christ, slain and coming to life again.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	20	By faith also of things to come Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and adored the top of his rod. Adored the top of his rod.... The apostle here follows the ancient Greek Bible of the seventy interpreters, (which translates in this manner, Gen. 47. 31.,) and alleges this fact of Jacob, in paying a relative honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of Joseph, as to a figure of Christ’s sceptre and kingdom, as an instance and argument of his faith. But some translators, who are no friends to this relative honour, have corrupted the text, by translating it, he worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff; as if this circumstance of leaning upon his staff were any argument of Jacob’s faith, or worthy the being thus particularly taken notice of by the Holy Ghost.

That is, in all things belonging to the marriage state. This is a warning to married people, not to abuse the sanctity of their state, by any liberties or irregularities contrary thereunto. Now it does not follow from this text that all persons are obliged to marry, even if the word omnibus were rendered, in all persons, instead of in all things: for if it was a precept, St. Paul himself would have transgressed it, as he never married. Moreover, those who have already made a vow to God to lead a single life, should they attempt to marry, they would incur their own damnation. 1 Tim. 5. 12.

10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach. Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.... That is, bearing his cross. It is an exhortation to them to be willing to suffer with Christ, reproaches, persecutions, and even death, if they desire to partake of the benefit of his suffering for man’s redemption.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	14	For, we have not here a lasting city: but we seek one that is to come.

10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	17	Obey your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls: that they may do this with joy and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	19	And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	20	And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	21	Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.
10	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews	13	22	And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.

10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	8	But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.

10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	12	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	16	For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.

10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	4	For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	13	For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	19	Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	24	But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	26	For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	13	In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	1	Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	9	Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	10	Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	20	Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	21	And having an high priest over the house of God;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	18	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	10	For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	17	For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	20	(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	22	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	26	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	27	And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	1	Let brotherly love continue.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	5	Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	19	But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	22	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
10	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	1	God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	2	has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	3	For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he took his seat at the right hand of God’s Majesty on high,
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	4	having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	6	And again, when God brought the firstborn into the world, he said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	7	Speaking of the angels, he said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	8	while of the Son he said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	9	You love righteousness and hates iniquity;
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	10	Again –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish, but you remain;
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	12	As a mantle you will fold them up,
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	13	To which of the angels has God ever said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	1	14	Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	2	For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	3	how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	4	while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	5	God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	6	No; a writer has declared somewhere –
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	7	You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	8	you have placed all things beneath their feet.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	9	What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	10	It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	11	For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	12	He says –
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	13	And again –
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	15	and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	16	It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	17	And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.
10	OEB	Hebrews	2	18	The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	2	See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	3	He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	5	While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	6	the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says –
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	8	harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	9	Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	11	While in my wrath I swore –
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	12	Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	13	Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	14	For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	15	To use the words of scripture –
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	16	Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	18	And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?
10	OEB	Hebrews	3	19	We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	1	We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	2	For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	3	Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	4	for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words –
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	5	On the other hand, we read in that passage –
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	6	Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	7	again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted –
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	8	Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	9	There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	10	For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	11	Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	12	God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	13	There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	14	We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	15	Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.
10	OEB	Hebrews	4	16	Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	1	Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	2	And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	3	and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	4	Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	5	In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him –
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	6	and on another occasion also –
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	7	Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	8	Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	9	and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	10	while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	11	Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	12	For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.
10	OEB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	1	Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	2	teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	3	Yes and, with God’s help, we will.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	4	For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	5	and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	6	if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	7	Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	8	but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	9	But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	11	But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	12	Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	13	When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	14	His words were –
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	15	And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	16	People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	17	And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	18	For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	19	This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,
10	OEB	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	1	It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	2	and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	3	There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	4	Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	5	Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	6	But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	7	Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	9	Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	10	for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	11	If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	12	With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	13	And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	15	All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	16	and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	17	for that is the meaning of the declaration –
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	18	On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	19	(for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	20	Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	21	but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him –
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	22	And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	23	Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	24	but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	25	And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	26	This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	27	one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.
10	OEB	Hebrews	7	28	The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	1	To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	2	where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	4	If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	5	(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	6	But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	7	If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	8	But, finding fault with the people, God says –
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	9	Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	10	“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	11	There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their wrongdoings,
10	OEB	Hebrews	8	13	By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	1	It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	2	For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	3	The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	4	In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	5	while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	6	Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	7	but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	8	By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	9	For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	10	the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	11	But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	12	Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	13	For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	15	And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	16	Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	17	For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	18	This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	19	For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	20	saying, as he did so – “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	22	Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	23	While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	24	For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	26	for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	27	And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),
10	OEB	Hebrews	9	28	so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	1	The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	3	But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	4	For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	5	That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared –
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	6	You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	7	So I said, “See, I have come” (as is written of me in the pages of the book),
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	8	First come the words – ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the Law),
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	9	and then there is added – ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	10	And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	11	Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	12	But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	13	and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	14	By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	15	We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying –
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	16	‘“This is the covenant that I will make with them
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	17	then we have –
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	18	And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he inaugurated for us – a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	21	and, since we have in him ‘a great priest set over the house of God,’
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	24	Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	25	And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	26	Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	27	there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	28	When someone disregarded the Law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	30	We know who it was that said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	32	Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	34	For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	35	Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	36	You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	37	‘For there is indeed but a very little while
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	38	and through faith the righteous will find life,
10	OEB	Hebrews	10	39	But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	1	Faith is the realization of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	2	And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	3	Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	4	Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	5	Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	6	but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	7	It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	8	It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterward to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	9	It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	11	Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for childbearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	12	And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous ‘as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	13	All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only foreigners and strangers on the earth.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	14	Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	16	But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	17	It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	18	of whom it had been said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	19	For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	20	It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	21	Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and ‘to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	22	Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	23	Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	24	It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of ‘son of a daughter of Pharaoh.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	25	He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	26	For he counted ‘the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ’ of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	27	Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	28	Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	29	Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	30	Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	31	Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	32	Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	33	By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	34	quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	36	Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	38	people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	39	Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfillment of God’s promise;
10	OEB	Hebrews	11	40	since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	1	Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	2	our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	3	Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children –
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	6	For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	7	It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	8	If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	9	Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	10	Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	11	No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	13	make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	14	Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	15	Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	16	Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	18	It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	19	and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	20	for they could not bear to think of the command – ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – ‘I tremble with fear.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	22	No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	23	to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	25	Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	26	Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is –
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	27	And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.
10	OEB	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	1	Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	2	Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	3	Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	5	Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said –
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	6	Therefore we may say with confidence –
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	7	Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever!
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	9	Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	10	We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	11	The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	12	And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	13	Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	14	for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	15	Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	16	Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	19	And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	20	May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord –
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	21	may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	22	I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	23	You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	24	Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.
10	OEB	Hebrews	13	25	May God bless you all.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	1	God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	2	has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	3	His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	4	having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did he say at any time, You are my Son. Today have I become your father?{Psalm 2:7} and again, I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?{2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13}
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	6	Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, Let all the angels of God worship him.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	7	Of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire.{Psalm 104:4}
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	8	But of the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.{Psalm 45:6-7}
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	10	And, You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish, but you continue.  They all will grow old like a garment does.
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	12	As a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same.  Your years will not fail.{Psalm 102:25-27}
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	13	But which of the angels has he told at any time, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?{Psalm 110:1}
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	14	Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
10	WEB	Hebrews	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	3	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation-- which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	5	For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	6	But one has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that you think of him?  Or the son of man, that you care for him?
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels.  You crowned him with glory and honor.{TR adds and set him over the works of your hands}
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	8	You have put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:4-6} For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him.  But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	9	But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	11	For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.},
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	12	saying, I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.{Psalm 22:22}
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	13	Again, I will put my trust in him.{Isaiah 8:17} Again, Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.{Isaiah 8:18}
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	14	Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	15	and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	16	For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
10	WEB	Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	3	For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	5	Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear his voice,
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	8	don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	11	as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into my rest.'{Psalm 95:7-11}
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	12	Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	13	but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.{Psalm 95:7-8}
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	16	For who, when they heard, rebelled?  No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	17	With whom was he displeased forty years?  Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	18	To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
10	WEB	Hebrews	3	19	We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;{Psalm 95:11} although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	4	For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, God rested on the seventh day from all his works;{Genesis 2:2}
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	5	and in this place again, They will not enter into my rest.{Psalm 95:11}
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	7	he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts.{Psalm 95:7-8}
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	9	There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	10	For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	13	There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	14	Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	15	For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
10	WEB	Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	2	The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	3	Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	4	Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, You are my Son. Today I have become your father.{Psalm 2:7}
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	6	As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	7	He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	8	though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	9	Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	10	named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	11	About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	12	For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.
10	WEB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	2	of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	3	This will we do, if God permits.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	4	For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	5	and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	6	and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	7	For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	8	but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	11	We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	12	that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	14	saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.{Genesis 22:17}
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	15	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	16	For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	17	In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	18	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
10	WEB	Hebrews	6	20	where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	5	They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	6	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	8	Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	9	We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	11	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	15	This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	16	who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	17	for it is testified, You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	18	For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	19	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	20	Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	21	(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, The Lord swore and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'{Psalm 110:4}
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	22	By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	23	Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	24	But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	26	For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	27	who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.
10	WEB	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	1	Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	2	a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.  Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	5	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.{Exodus 25:40}
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	6	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	11	They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,{TR reads neighbor instead of fellow citizen} and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.  I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.{Jeremiah 31:31-34}
10	WEB	Hebrews	8	13	In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	1	Now indeed even the first{TR adds tabernacle} covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was prepared.  In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	3	After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	4	having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	5	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	6	Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	7	but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	9	which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	10	being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	12	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	16	For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	17	For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	20	saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.{Exodus 24:8}
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	22	According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	23	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	25	nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	26	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world.  But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	27	Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,
10	WEB	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	2	Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me;
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	6	You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'{Psalm 40:6-8}
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	8	Previously saying, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them (those which are offered according to the law),
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	9	then he has said, Behold, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	10	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	12	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	13	from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'{Jeremiah 31:33} then he says,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	17	I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.{Jeremiah 31:34}
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	21	and having a great priest over the house of God,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	22	let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	23	let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	24	Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	28	A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, says the Lord, I will repay.{Deuteronomy 32:35} Again, The Lord will judge his people.{Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14}
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	33	partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	36	For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	37	In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	38	But the righteous will live by faith.  If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.{Habakkuk 2:3-4}
10	WEB	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	2	For by this, the elders obtained testimony.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	3	By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	6	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	7	By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	8	By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	9	By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen{TR adds and being convinced of} them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	15	If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	18	even he to whom it was said, In Isaac will your seed be called;{Genesis 21:12}
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	19	concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	20	By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	21	By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	22	By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	23	By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	26	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	29	By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	32	What more shall I say?  For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	33	who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,{Daniel 6:22-23}
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire,{Daniel 3:1-30} escaped the edge of the sword,{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead by resurrection.{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	36	Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned.{2 Chronicles 24:20-21} They were sawn apart. They were tempted.  They were slain with the sword.{Jeremiah 26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10} They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	38	(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	39	These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,
10	WEB	Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	1	Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	2	looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	3	For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.{Proverbs 3:11-12}
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure.  God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect.  Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	11	All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,{Isaiah 35:3}
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet,{Proverbs 4:26} so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	14	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	15	looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	16	lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	19	the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	20	for they could not stand that which was commanded, If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned{TR adds or shot with an arrow [see Exodus 19:12-13]};{Exodus 19:12-13}
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.{Deuteronomy 9:19}
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,{Jeremiah 31:31} and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	25	See that you don't refuse him who speaks.  For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.{Haggai 2:6}
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	27	This phrase, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,
10	WEB	Hebrews	12	29	for our God is a consuming fire.{Deuteronomy 4:24}
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	1	Let brotherly love continue.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	2	Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled:  but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	5	Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you.{Deuteronomy 31:6}
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	6	So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper. I will not fear.  What can man do to me?{Psalm 118:6-7}
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	9	Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.{Leviticus 16:27}
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	13	Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	14	For we don't have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	15	Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God{Psalm 50:23} continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	16	But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	19	I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	20	Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	21	make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	22	But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.
10	WEB	Hebrews	13	24	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	1	James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	2	My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations: Into divers temptations.... The word temptation, in this epistle, is sometimes taken for trials by afflictions or persecutions, as in this place: at other times, it is to be understood, tempting, enticing, or drawing others into sin.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	3	Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	4	And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	5	But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	7	Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	8	A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	9	But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	10	And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	11	For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished. So also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love him.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	13	Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	14	But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	15	Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	16	Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	17	Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	18	For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creature. Some beginning.... That is, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	19	You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak and slow to anger.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	20	For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	21	Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	22	But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	23	For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	24	For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of man he was.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	25	But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	26	And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	1	27	Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world. James Chapter 2 Against respect of persons. The danger of transgressing one point of the law. Faith is dead without works.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, with respect of persons. With respect of persons.... The meaning is, that in matters relating to faith, the administering of the sacraments, and other spiritual functions in God’s church, there should be no respect of persons; but that the souls of the poor should be as much regarded as those of the rich. See Deut. 1.17.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	2	For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire:
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	3	And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel and shall say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or: Sit under my footstool:
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	4	Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	5	Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	6	But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	8	If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	9	But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	10	And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. Guilty of all; ... That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such a manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him to salvation; for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great and general commandment of charity, even by one mortal sin. For all the precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law, and as it were a chain of precepts, where, by breaking one link of this chain, the whole chain is broken, or the integrity of the law consisting of a collection of precepts. A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence against any one precept, incurs eternal punishment; yet the punishment in hell shall be greater for those who have been greater sinners, as a greater reward shall be for those in heaven who have lived with greater sanctity and perfection.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	11	For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	12	So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	13	For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	14	What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	15	And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	16	And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	17	So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	18	But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	22	Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works faith was made perfect?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	24	Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	25	And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	2	26	For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works is dead. James Chapter 3 Of the evils of the tongue. Of the difference between the earthly and heavenly wisdom.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	1	Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	2	For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	3	For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us: and we turn about their whole body.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	4	Behold also ships, whereas they are great and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	5	Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	7	For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the rest is tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	8	But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	9	By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men who are made after the likeness of God.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes? Or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	14	But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	15	For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	16	For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and every evil work.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	3	18	And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace. James Chapter 4 The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends to this world. Admonitions against pride, detraction and the like.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	1	From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	2	You covet, and have not: you kill and envy and cannot obtain. You contend and war, and you have not: because you ask not.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	3	You ask and receive not: because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your concupiscences.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	4	Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world becometh an enemy of God.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	5	Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	6	But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	7	Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil: and he will fly from you.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	8	Draw nigh to God: and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	9	Be afflicted and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into sorrow.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	10	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord: and he will exalt you.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	11	Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	12	There is one lawgiver and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	13	But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year and will traffic and make our gain.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	14	Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	15	For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and, If we shall live, we will do this or that.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	16	But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	4	17	To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is sin. James Chapter 5 A woe to the rich that oppress the poor. Exhortations to patience and to avoid swearing. Of the anointing the sick, confession of sins and fervour in prayer.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	1	Go to now, ye rich men: weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	2	Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	4	Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	5	You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the Just One: and he resisted you not.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	7	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	8	Be you therefore also patient and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	9	Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	10	Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	11	Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be: Yea, Yea: No, No: that you fall not under judgment.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	13	Is any of you sad? Let him pray: Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	14	Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. Let him bring in, etc.... See here a plain warrant of scripture for the sacrament of extreme unction, that any controversy against its institution would be against the express words of the sacred text in the plainest terms.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	16	Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much. Confess your sins one to another.... That is, to the priests of the church, whom (ver.14) he had ordered to be called for, and brought in to the sick; moreover, to confess to persons who had no power to forgive sins, would be useless. Hence the precept here means, that we must confess to men whom God hath appointed, and who, by their ordination and jurisdiction, have received the power of remitting sins in his name.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	17	Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth. And it rained not for three years and six months.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	18	And he prayed again. And the heaven gave rain: and the earth brought forth her fruit.
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	19	My brethren, if any of you err from the truth and one convert him:
11	DRB	The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle	5	20	He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way shall save his soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	3	Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	4	But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	8	A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	10	But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	14	But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	19	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	24	For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	3	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	9	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	14	What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	2	26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	3	Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	4	Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	16	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	1	From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	13	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	14	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	4	17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	1	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	6	Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	16	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
11	KJV	The General Epistle of James	5	20	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
11	OEB	James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the twelve tribes that are living abroad.
11	OEB	James	1	2	My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,
11	OEB	James	1	3	knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.
11	OEB	James	1	4	And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.
11	OEB	James	1	5	If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.
11	OEB	James	1	6	But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –
11	OEB	James	1	7	Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,
11	OEB	James	1	8	vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.
11	OEB	James	1	9	Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,
11	OEB	James	1	10	but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.
11	OEB	James	1	11	As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.
11	OEB	James	1	12	Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
11	OEB	James	1	13	Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.
11	OEB	James	1	14	A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.
11	OEB	James	1	15	Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.
11	OEB	James	1	16	Do not be deceived, my dear friends.
11	OEB	James	1	17	Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.
11	OEB	James	1	18	Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation.
11	OEB	James	1	19	Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;
11	OEB	James	1	20	for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.
11	OEB	James	1	21	Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.
11	OEB	James	1	22	Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.
11	OEB	James	1	23	For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.
11	OEB	James	1	24	They look at themselves, then go on their way,
11	OEB	James	1	25	but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.
11	OEB	James	1	26	When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.
11	OEB	James	1	27	That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.
11	OEB	James	2	1	My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?
11	OEB	James	2	2	Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,
11	OEB	James	2	3	and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”
11	OEB	James	2	4	Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?
11	OEB	James	2	5	Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?
11	OEB	James	2	6	But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?
11	OEB	James	2	7	Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?
11	OEB	James	2	8	If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;
11	OEB	James	2	9	but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.
11	OEB	James	2	10	For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.
11	OEB	James	2	11	He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.
11	OEB	James	2	12	Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’
11	OEB	James	2	13	For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.
11	OEB	James	2	14	My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?
11	OEB	James	2	15	Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,
11	OEB	James	2	16	and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?
11	OEB	James	2	17	In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.
11	OEB	James	2	18	Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.”
11	OEB	James	2	19	It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.
11	OEB	James	2	20	Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?
11	OEB	James	2	21	Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?
11	OEB	James	2	22	You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;
11	OEB	James	2	23	and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”
11	OEB	James	2	24	You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.
11	OEB	James	2	25	Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?
11	OEB	James	2	26	Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.
11	OEB	James	3	1	Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.
11	OEB	James	3	2	We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.
11	OEB	James	3	3	When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.
11	OEB	James	3	4	Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.
11	OEB	James	3	5	So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!
11	OEB	James	3	6	And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.
11	OEB	James	3	7	For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,
11	OEB	James	3	8	no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!
11	OEB	James	3	9	With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’
11	OEB	James	3	10	From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.
11	OEB	James	3	11	Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?
11	OEB	James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.
11	OEB	James	3	13	Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.
11	OEB	James	3	14	But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.
11	OEB	James	3	15	That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.
11	OEB	James	3	16	For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.
11	OEB	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.
11	OEB	James	3	18	Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace.
11	OEB	James	4	1	What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?
11	OEB	James	4	2	You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.
11	OEB	James	4	3	You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.
11	OEB	James	4	4	Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.
11	OEB	James	4	5	Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’
11	OEB	James	4	6	But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, –
11	OEB	James	4	7	Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.
11	OEB	James	4	8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!
11	OEB	James	4	9	Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!
11	OEB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
11	OEB	James	4	11	Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.
11	OEB	James	4	12	There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor?
11	OEB	James	4	13	Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’
11	OEB	James	4	14	yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
11	OEB	James	4	15	Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’
11	OEB	James	4	16	But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.
11	OEB	James	4	17	The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them.
11	OEB	James	5	1	Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!
11	OEB	James	5	2	Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.
11	OEB	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire, so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.
11	OEB	James	5	4	Listen! The wages you have held back from the laborers who mowed your fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts!
11	OEB	James	5	5	You have lived on earth a life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a time of bloodshed.
11	OEB	James	5	6	You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous one! Must not God be opposed to you?
11	OEB	James	5	7	Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.
11	OEB	James	5	8	And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.
11	OEB	James	5	9	Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!
11	OEB	James	5	10	Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
11	OEB	James	5	11	We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’
11	OEB	James	5	12	Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.
11	OEB	James	5	13	If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.
11	OEB	James	5	14	If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
11	OEB	James	5	15	The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.
11	OEB	James	5	16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.
11	OEB	James	5	17	Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.
11	OEB	James	5	18	And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.
11	OEB	James	5	19	My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,
11	OEB	James	5	20	be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.
11	WEB	James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion:  Greetings.
11	WEB	James	1	2	Count it all joy, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, when you fall into various temptations,
11	WEB	James	1	3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
11	WEB	James	1	4	Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
11	WEB	James	1	5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him.
11	WEB	James	1	6	But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.
11	WEB	James	1	7	For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
11	WEB	James	1	8	He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
11	WEB	James	1	9	But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;
11	WEB	James	1	10	and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.
11	WEB	James	1	11	For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes.  So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.
11	WEB	James	1	12	Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.
11	WEB	James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God can't be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.
11	WEB	James	1	14	But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
11	WEB	James	1	15	Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.
11	WEB	James	1	16	Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.
11	WEB	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.
11	WEB	James	1	18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
11	WEB	James	1	19	So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
11	WEB	James	1	20	for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.
11	WEB	James	1	21	Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls{or, preserve your life.}.
11	WEB	James	1	22	But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.
11	WEB	James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;
11	WEB	James	1	24	for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
11	WEB	James	1	25	But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
11	WEB	James	1	26	If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless.
11	WEB	James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
11	WEB	James	2	1	My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.
11	WEB	James	2	2	For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue{or, meeting}, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;
11	WEB	James	2	3	and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, Sit here in a good place; and you tell the poor man, Stand there, or Sit by my footstool;
11	WEB	James	2	4	haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
11	WEB	James	2	5	Listen, my beloved brothers.  Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
11	WEB	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man.  Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?
11	WEB	James	2	7	Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
11	WEB	James	2	8	However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself,{Leviticus 19:18} you do well.
11	WEB	James	2	9	But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
11	WEB	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.
11	WEB	James	2	11	For he who said, Do not commit adultery,{Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18} also said, Do not commit murder.{Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17} Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
11	WEB	James	2	12	So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.
11	WEB	James	2	13	For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
11	WEB	James	2	14	What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works?  Can faith save him?
11	WEB	James	2	15	And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
11	WEB	James	2	16	and one of you tells them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs, what good is it?
11	WEB	James	2	17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
11	WEB	James	2	18	Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.
11	WEB	James	2	19	You believe that God is one.  You do well.  The demons also believe, and shudder.
11	WEB	James	2	20	But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?
11	WEB	James	2	21	Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
11	WEB	James	2	22	You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;
11	WEB	James	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;{Genesis 15:16} and he was called the friend of God.
11	WEB	James	2	24	You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.
11	WEB	James	2	25	In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
11	WEB	James	2	26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
11	WEB	James	3	1	Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.
11	WEB	James	3	2	For in many things we all stumble.  If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
11	WEB	James	3	3	Indeed, we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.
11	WEB	James	3	4	Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.
11	WEB	James	3	5	So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!
11	WEB	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire.  The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.{or, Hell}
11	WEB	James	3	7	For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.
11	WEB	James	3	8	But nobody can tame the tongue.  It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
11	WEB	James	3	9	With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
11	WEB	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
11	WEB	James	3	11	Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
11	WEB	James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.
11	WEB	James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you?  Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.
11	WEB	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the truth.
11	WEB	James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
11	WEB	James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.
11	WEB	James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
11	WEB	James	3	18	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
11	WEB	James	4	1	Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members?
11	WEB	James	4	2	You lust, and don't have.  You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war.  You don't have, because you don't ask.
11	WEB	James	4	3	You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.
11	WEB	James	4	4	You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?  Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
11	WEB	James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously?
11	WEB	James	4	6	But he gives more grace.  Therefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}
11	WEB	James	4	7	Be subject therefore to God.  But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
11	WEB	James	4	8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.  Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
11	WEB	James	4	9	Lament, mourn, and weep.  Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
11	WEB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
11	WEB	James	4	11	Don't speak against one another, brothers.  He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law.  But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
11	WEB	James	4	12	Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?
11	WEB	James	4	13	Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.
11	WEB	James	4	14	Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life?  For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.
11	WEB	James	4	15	For you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.
11	WEB	James	4	16	But now you glory in your boasting.  All such boasting is evil.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	3	Saying: Hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in their foreheads.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	4	And I heard the number of them that were signed. An hundred forty-four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the children of Israel.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	5	Of the tribe of Juda, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Ruben, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand signed:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	6	Of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Nephthali, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Manasses, twelve thousand signed:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	7	Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand signed:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	8	Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand signed.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	9	After this, I saw a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne and to the Lamb.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	11	And all the angels stood round about the throne and the ancients and the four living creatures. And they fell down before the throne upon their faces and adored God,
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	12	Saying: Amen. Benediction and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, honour and power and strength, to our God, for ever and ever. Amen.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	13	And one of the ancients answered and said to me: These that are clothed in white robes, who are they? And whence came they?
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	14	And I said to him: My Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they who are come out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	15	Therefore, they are before the throne of God: and they serve him day and night in his temple. And he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	16	They shall no more hunger nor thirst: neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	17	For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall rule them and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. Apocalypse Chapter 8 The seventh seal is opened. The angels with the seven trumpets.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven, as it were for half an hour.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	2	And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God: and there were given to them seven trumpets.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	3	And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer: and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the throne of God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	4	And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	5	And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it on the earth: and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and a great earthquake.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpet.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	7	And the first angel sounded the trumpet: and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood: and it was cast on the earth. And the third part of the earth was burnt up: and the third part of the trees was burnt up: and all green grass was burnt up.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	8	And the second angel sounded the trumpet: and, as it were, a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	9	And the third part of those creatures died which had life in the sea: and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	10	And the third angel sounded the trumpet: and a great star fell from heaven, burning as it were a torch. And it fell on the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became wormwood. And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day did not shine for a third part of it: and the night in like manner.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	13	And I beheld: and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, Woe, Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the rest of the voices of the three angels, who are yet to sound the trumpet! Apocalypse Chapter 9 Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of horsemen.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	1	And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. A star full.... This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith. Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.... That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star. To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit: and the smoke of the pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	3	And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. There came out locusts.... These may be devils in Antichrist’s time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads. Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc. These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies. Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists: besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	5	And it was given unto them that they should not kill them: but that they should torment them five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	6	And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die: and death shall fly from them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle. And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold: and their faces were as the faces of men.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women: and their teeth were as lions.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	9	And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron: and the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	10	And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men, five months. And they had over them
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	11	A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	12	One woe is past: and behold there come yet two woes more hereafter.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet: and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of God,
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	14	Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet: Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	15	And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third part of men.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	16	And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand. And I heard the number of them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision. And they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions: and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	18	And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads: and with them they hurt.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	20	And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	21	Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts. Apocalypse Chapter 10 The cry of a mighty angel. He gives John a book to eat.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head: and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	2	And he had in his hand a little book, open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	3	And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken. And write them not.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	5	And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	6	And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things which are in it, and the sea and the things which are therein: That time shall be no longer.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the prophets. Declared.... literally evangelized, to signify the good tidings, agreeable to the Gospel, of the final victory of Christ, and of that eternal life, which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of the martyrs and faithful servants of God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	8	And I heard a voice from heaven, again speaking to me and saying: Go and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	9	And I went to the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book and eat it up. And it shall make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	10	And I took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it up: and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey. And when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	11	And he said to me: Thou must prophesy again to many nations and peoples and tongues and kings. Apocalypse Chapter 11 He is ordered to measure the temple. The two witnesses.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	1	And there was given me a reed, like unto a rod. And it was said to me: Arise, and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that adore therein.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	2	But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles. And the holy city they shall tread under foot, two and forty months:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	3	And I will give unto my two witnesses: and they shall prophesy, a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. My two witnesses.... It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand before the Lord of the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	5	And if any man will hurt them, fire shall come out of their mouths and shall devour their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, in this manner must he be slain.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	6	These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: And they have power over waters, to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	8	And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which is called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt: where their Lord also was crucified.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	9	And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall see their bodies for three days and a half: and they shall not suffer their bodies to be laid in sepulchres.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry: and shall send gifts one to another, because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	11	And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God entered into them. And they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell upon them that saw them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	12	And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them: Come up hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud: and their enemies saw them.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	13	And at that hour there was made a great earthquake: and the tenth part of the city fell. And there were slain in the earthquake, names of men, seven thousand: and the rest were cast into a fear and gave glory to the God of heaven.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	14	The second woe is past: and behold the third woe will come quickly.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	15	And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet: and there were great voices in heaven, saying: The kingdom of this world is become our Lord’s and his Christ’s, and he shall reign for ever and ever. Amen.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	16	And the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the sight of God, fell on their faces and adored God, saying:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	17	We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast and who art to come: because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and thou hast reigned.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	18	And the nations were angry: and thy wrath is come. And the time of the dead, that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints, and to them that fear thy name, little and great: and shouldest destroy them who have corrupted the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven: and the ark of his testament was seen in his temple. And there were lightnings and voices and an earthquake and great hail. Apocalypse Chapter 12 The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon her persecutor.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	1	And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. A woman.... The church of God. It may also, by allusion, be applied to our blessed Lady. The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet: and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	2	And being with child, she cried travailing in birth: and was in pain to be delivered.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	3	And there was seen another sign in heaven. And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered: that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	5	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod. And her son was taken up to God and to his throne.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her, a thousand two hundred sixty days.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	7	And there was a great battle in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	8	And they prevailed not: neither was their place found any more in heaven.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	9	And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world. And he was cast unto the earth: and his angels were thrown down with him.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our God day and night.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of the testimony: and they loved not their lives unto death.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	12	Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	14	And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert, unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the woman, water, as it were a river: that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	16	And the earth helped the woman: and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	17	And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	18	And he stood upon the sand of the sea. Apocalypse Chapter 13 Of the beast with seven heads and of a second beast.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	1	And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns: and upon his horns, ten diadems: and upon his heads, names of blasphemy. A beast.... This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.: the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz., the empire of Rome: and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard: and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his own strength and great power.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	3	And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and his death’s wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration after the beast. One of his heads, etc.... Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the Apostate.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	4	And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast. And they adored the beast, saying: Who is like to the beast? And who shall be able to fight with him?
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	5	And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies: and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	6	And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. His tabernacle, etc.... That is, his church and his saints.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	8	And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the beginning of the world. Slain from the beginning, etc.... In the foreknowledge of God; and inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view of his death and passion.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	9	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	10	He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity: he that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	11	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had two horns, like a lamb: and he spoke as a dragon. Another beast.... This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	12	And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	13	And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down from heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	14	And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which had the wound by the sword and lived.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	15	And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast: and that the image of the beast should speak: and should cause that whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	16	And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on their foreheads:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	17	And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	18	Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the number of him is six hundred sixty-six. Six hundred sixty-six.... The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number. Apocalypse Chapter 14 Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him. Of the judgments that shall fall upon the wicked.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	1	And I beheld: and lo a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters and as the voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	3	And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	4	These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	5	And in their mouth there was found no lie: for they are without spot before the throne of God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	6	And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over every nation and tribe and tongue and people:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	7	Saying with a loud voice: Fear the Lord and give him honour, because the hour of his judgment is come. And adore ye him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	8	And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Babylon.... By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked world in general, which God will punish, and destroy after the short time of this mortal life: or it may signify every great city wherein enormous sins and abominations are daily committed; and that when the measure of its iniquities is full, the punishments due to its crimes are poured on it. It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end of the world.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character in his forehead or in his hand,
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	10	He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath: and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	11	And the smoke of their torments, shall ascend up for ever and ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	12	Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me: Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours. For their works follow them. Die in the Lord.... It is understood of the martyrs who die for the Lord.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	14	And I saw: and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp sickle.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	15	And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap. For the harvest of the earth is ripe.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth: and the earth was reaped.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes thereof are ripe.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	19	And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	20	And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs. Apocalypse Chapter 15 They that have overcome the beast glorify God. Of the seven angels with the seven vials.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels having the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath of God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	3	And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the canticle of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, O King of ages.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	4	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name? For thou only art holy. For all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight, because thy judgments are manifest.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	5	And after these things, I looked: and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	6	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts with golden girdles.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	7	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and from his power. And no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. Apocalypse Chapter 16 The seven vials are poured out. The plagues that ensue.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	2	And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. And there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of the beast: and upon them that adored the image thereof.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea. And there came blood as it were of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	4	And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of waters. And there was made blood.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets: and thou hast given them blood to drink. For they are worthy.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	7	And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun. And it was given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	9	And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues. Neither did they penance to give him glory.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast. And his kingdom became dark: and they gnawed their tongues for pain.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	11	And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and wounds: and did not penance for their works.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	13	And I saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	14	For they are the spirits of devils, working signs: and they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle against the great day of the Almighty God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	16	And he shall gather them together into a place which in Hebrew is called Armagedon. Armagedon.... That is, the hill of robbers.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air. And there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It is done.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	18	And there were lightnings and voices and thunders: and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	19	And the great city was divided into three parts: and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	20	And every island fled away: and the mountains were not found.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	21	And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God, for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great. Apocalypse Chapter 17 The description of the great harlot and of the beast upon which she sits.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	1	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. And they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	3	And he took me away in spirit into the desert. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	4	And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	5	And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery: Babylon the great, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth. A mystery.... That is, a secret; because what follows of the name and title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense. Babylon.... Either the city of the devil in general; or, if this place be to be understood of any particular city, pagan Rome, which then and for three hundred years persecuted the church; and was the principal seat both of empire and idolatry.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I wondered, when I had seen her, with great admiration.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	7	And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	8	The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction. And the inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not. The beast which thou sawest.... This beast which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil: which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist. The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap. 13.1, and below, ver. 10.) The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	9	And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth: and they are seven kings.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	10	Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come: and when he is come, he must remain a short time.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	11	And the beast which was and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom: but shall receive power as kings, one hour after the beast. Ten kings.... Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the church of Christ: which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the justice of God for the punishment of Babylon. Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of Rome.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	13	These have one design: and their strength and power they shall deliver to the beast.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	14	These shall fight with the Lamb. And the Lamb shall overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings: and they that are with him are called and elect and faithful.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	15	And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: These shall hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with fire.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	17	For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth him: that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	18	And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth. Apocalypse Chapter 18 The fall of Babylon. Kings and merchants lament over her.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	1	And after these things, I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power: and the earth was enlightened with his glory.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	2	And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen: and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every unclean spirit and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	3	Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication: and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her; And the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of her delicacies.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: Go out from her, my people; that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	5	For her sins have reached unto heaven: and the Lord hath remembered her iniquities.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	6	Render to her as she also hath rendered to you: and double unto her double, according to her works. In the cup wherein she hath mingled, mingle ye double unto her.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	7	As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her. Because she saith in her heart: I sit a queen and am no widow: and sorrow I shall not see.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	8	Therefore, shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she shall be burnt with the fire: because God is strong, who shall judge her.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived in delicacies with her, shall weep and bewail themselves over her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	10	Standing afar off for fear of her torments, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, Babylon, that mighty city: for in one hour is thy judgment come.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her: for no man shall buy their merchandise any more.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	12	Merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones: and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet: and all thyine wood: and all manner of vessels of ivory: and all manner of vessels of precious stone and of brass and of iron and of marble:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	13	And cinnamon and odours and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots: and slaves and souls of men.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	14	And the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee: and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee. And they shall find them no more at all.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	15	The merchants of these things, who were made rich, shall stand afar off from her, for fear of her torments, weeping and mourning,
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	16	And saying: Alas! alas! that great city, which was clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet and was gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	17	For in one hour are so great riches come to nought. And every shipmaster and all that sail into the lake, and mariners, and as many as work in the sea, stood afar off,
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	18	And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What city is like to this great city?
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	19	And they cast dust upon their heads and cried, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were made rich, that had ships at sea, by reason of her prices. For, in one hour she is made desolate.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	20	Rejoice over her, thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets. For God hath judged your judgment on her.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	21	And a mighty angel took up a stone, as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: With such violence as this, shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down and shall be found no more at all.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	22	And the voice of harpers and of musicians and of them that play on the pipe and on the trumpet shall no more be heard at all in thee: and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in thee: and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	23	And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee: and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth: for all nations have been deceived by thy enchantments.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	18	24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth. Apocalypse Chapter 19 The saints glorify God for his judgments on the great harlot. Christ’s victory over the beast and the kings of the earth.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	1	After these things, I heard as it were the voice of much people in heaven, saying: Alleluia. Salvation and glory and power is to our God.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	2	For true and just are his judgments, who hath judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication and hath revenged the blood of his servants, at her hands.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	3	And again they said: Alleluia. And her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	4	And the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures fell down and adored God that sitteth upon the throne, saying: Amen. Alleluia.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	5	And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our God, all ye his servants: and you that fear him, little and great.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunders, saying: Alleluia: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, hath reigned.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	7	Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb is come: and his wife hath prepared herself.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	8	And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine linen, glittering and white. For the fine linen are the justifications of saints.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	9	And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they that are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me: These words of God are true.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	10	And I fell down before his feet, to adore him. And he saith to me: See thou do it not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. I fell down before, etc.... St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant. St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	11	And I saw heaven opened: and behold a white horse. And he that sat upon him was called faithful and true: and with justice doth he judge and fight.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	12	And his eyes were as a flame of fire: and on his head were many diadems. And he had a name written, which no man knoweth but himself.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	15	And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may strike the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	16	And he hath on his garment and on his thigh written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun: and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that did fly through the midst of heaven: Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God:
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	18	That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them: and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen and of little and of great.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who wrought signs before him, wherewith he seduced them who received the character of the beast and who adored his image. These two were cast alive into the pool of fire burning with brimstone.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	19	21	And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the horse, which proceedeth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh. Apocalypse Chapter 20 Satan is bound for a thousand years. The souls of the martyrs reign with Christ in the first resurrection. The last attempts of Satan against the church. The last judgment.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	1	And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	2	And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. Bound him, etc.... The power of Satan has been very much limited by the passion of Christ: for a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of the New Testament; but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the church, towards the end of the world. During which time the souls of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory; as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of the general judgment.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	3	And he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him, that he should no more seduce the nations till the thousand years be finished. And after that, he must be loosed a little time.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	4	And I saw seats. And they sat upon them: and judgment was given unto them. And the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God and who had not adored the beast nor his image nor received his character on their foreheads or in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	5	The rest of the dead lived not, till the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection. In these the second death hath no power. But they shall be priests of God and of Christ: and shall reign with him a thousand years.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	7	And when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go forth and seduce the nations which are over the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog: and shall gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	8	And they came upon the breadth of the earth and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	10	And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is at hand. For the time is at hand.... That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world. Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men. In fine, others think that St. John’s design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general: the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events: for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	11	He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is just, let him be justified still: and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still. Let him hurt still.... It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in sin; but an intimation, that how far soever the wicked may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments.

12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	19	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	20	He that giveth testimony of these things, saith: Surely, I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
12	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. APPENDICES These texts come from the 1582 Rhemes and 1610 Doway printings of the portions of the Bible. The primary sources provide a glimpse both into the history of the Douay-Rheims version and the English language itself. The reader will quickly notice that the letter ‘j’ does not appear in the texts, rather ‘i’ functions either as a vowel or a consonant. Likewise ‘u’ is not a distinct letter; it is employed typographically in the lower-case in place of ‘v’ where not starting a word. The letters ‘u’ and ‘v’ both function either as vowels or consonants. The word ‘vniuersity’ demonstrates this rule. The letter ‘w’ is often employed, but in many cases the earlier form of a double-v (vv) appears instead. The transcriber has done his best to render the text accurately. Note the relaxed spelling standards of the time; many variants appear. While the errata section from the 1610 edition observed: “We haue also found some other faultes of lesse importance; and feare there be more. But we trust the reader may easely correct them, as they occurre.” only obvious errors have been amended. Where the transcriber has doubt between whether an irregular spelling is either an error and a variant, the printed text stands. 7-bit ASCII cannot fully represent the typographical standards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many special characters have been replaced with modern equivalents. Where verse numbers stand in the margins of the printed texts, they

12	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

12	KJV	The First Epistle General of John	5	16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

12	OEB	John	1	1	In the beginning the Word was;
12	OEB	John	1	2	He was in the beginning with God;
12	OEB	John	1	3	through him all things came into being,
12	OEB	John	1	4	That which came into being in him was life;
12	OEB	John	1	5	and the light shines in the darkness,
12	OEB	John	1	6	There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;
12	OEB	John	1	7	he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light
12	OEB	John	1	8	He was not the light,
12	OEB	John	1	9	That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.
12	OEB	John	1	10	He was in the world;
12	OEB	John	1	11	He came to his own –
12	OEB	John	1	12	But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God –
12	OEB	John	1	13	For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life,
12	OEB	John	1	14	And the Word became human, and lived among us,
12	OEB	John	1	15	(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke –
12	OEB	John	1	16	out of his fullness we have all received
12	OEB	John	1	17	for the Law was given through Moses,
12	OEB	John	1	18	No one has ever yet seen God;
12	OEB	John	1	19	When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”,
12	OEB	John	1	20	he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.”
12	OEB	John	1	21	“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”
12	OEB	John	1	22	“Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
12	OEB	John	1	23	“I,” he answered, “am –
12	OEB	John	1	24	These men had been sent from the Pharisees;
12	OEB	John	1	25	and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”
12	OEB	John	1	26	John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;
12	OEB	John	1	27	he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”
12	OEB	John	1	28	This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
12	OEB	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
12	OEB	John	1	30	I was talking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’
12	OEB	John	1	31	I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”
12	OEB	John	1	32	John also said:
12	OEB	John	1	33	I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
12	OEB	John	1	34	This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”
12	OEB	John	1	35	The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,
12	OEB	John	1	36	he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!”
12	OEB	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.
12	OEB	John	1	38	But Jesus turned around, and saw them following.  “What are you looking for?”  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?”
12	OEB	John	1	39	“Come, and you will see,”  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him.
12	OEB	John	1	40	One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
12	OEB	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)
12	OEB	John	1	42	Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said,  “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).
12	OEB	John	1	43	The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him,  “Follow me.”
12	OEB	John	1	44	Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.
12	OEB	John	1	45	He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”
12	OEB	John	1	46	“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.
12	OEB	John	1	47	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said,  “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”
12	OEB	John	1	48	“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael.  “Even before Philip called you,”  replied Jesus,  “when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
12	OEB	John	1	49	“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”
12	OEB	John	1	50	“Do you believe in me,”  asked Jesus,  “because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!
12	OEB	John	1	51	In truth I tell you,”  he added,  “you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
12	OEB	John	2	1	Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.
12	OEB	John	2	2	Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.
12	OEB	John	2	3	And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”
12	OEB	John	2	4	“What do you want with me?”  answered Jesus.  “My time has not come yet.”
12	OEB	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
12	OEB	John	2	6	There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
12	OEB	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants,  “Fill the water-jars with water.”
12	OEB	John	2	8	And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added,  “Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”  The servants did so.
12	OEB	John	2	9	And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –
12	OEB	John	2	10	He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”
12	OEB	John	2	11	This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
12	OEB	John	2	12	After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.
12	OEB	John	2	13	Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
12	OEB	John	2	14	In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.
12	OEB	John	2	15	So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,
12	OEB	John	2	16	and said to the pigeon-dealers,  “Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.”
12	OEB	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’
12	OEB	John	2	18	Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”
12	OEB	John	2	19	“Destroy this temple,”  was his answer,  “and I will raise it in three days.”
12	OEB	John	2	20	“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”
12	OEB	John	2	21	But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.
12	OEB	John	2	22	Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.
12	OEB	John	2	23	While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.
12	OEB	John	2	24	But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.
12	OEB	John	2	25	He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.
12	OEB	John	3	1	Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.
12	OEB	John	3	2	This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”
12	OEB	John	3	3	“In truth I tell you,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.”
12	OEB	John	3	4	“How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”
12	OEB	John	3	5	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.
12	OEB	John	3	6	All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual.
12	OEB	John	3	7	Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn.
12	OEB	John	3	8	The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.”
12	OEB	John	3	9	“How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.
12	OEB	John	3	10	“What! You a teacher of Israel,”  exclaimed Jesus,  “and yet do not understand this!
12	OEB	John	3	11	In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements.
12	OEB	John	3	12	If, when I tell you earthly things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you of heavenly things?
12	OEB	John	3	13	No one has ascended to heaven, except him who descended from heaven – the Son of Man himself.
12	OEB	John	3	14	And, as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
12	OEB	John	3	15	so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”
12	OEB	John	3	16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.
12	OEB	John	3	17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.
12	OEB	John	3	18	The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God.
12	OEB	John	3	19	The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked.
12	OEB	John	3	20	For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed;
12	OEB	John	3	21	but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do.
12	OEB	John	3	22	After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.
12	OEB	John	3	23	John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.
12	OEB	John	3	24	(For John had not yet been imprisoned).
12	OEB	John	3	25	Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification;
12	OEB	John	3	26	and the disciples came to John and said, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”
12	OEB	John	3	27	John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.
12	OEB	John	3	28	You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’
12	OEB	John	3	29	It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.
12	OEB	John	3	30	He must become greater, and I less.”
12	OEB	John	3	31	He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.
12	OEB	John	3	32	He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.
12	OEB	John	3	33	They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.
12	OEB	John	3	34	For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.
12	OEB	John	3	35	The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.
12	OEB	John	3	36	The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure.
12	OEB	John	4	1	Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John
12	OEB	John	4	2	(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),
12	OEB	John	4	3	he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.
12	OEB	John	4	4	He had to pass through Samaria,
12	OEB	John	4	5	and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
12	OEB	John	4	6	Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.
12	OEB	John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her –  “Give me some to drink,”
12	OEB	John	4	8	For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
12	OEB	John	4	9	“How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).
12	OEB	John	4	10	“If you knew of the gift of God,”  replied Jesus,  “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
12	OEB	John	4	11	“You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said. “Where did you get that ‘living water?’
12	OEB	John	4	12	Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!”
12	OEB	John	4	13	“All who drink of this water,”  replied Jesus,  “will be thirsty again;
12	OEB	John	4	14	but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.”
12	OEB	John	4	15	“Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.”
12	OEB	John	4	16	“Go and call your husband,”  said Jesus,  “and then come back.”
12	OEB	John	4	17	“I have no husband,” answered the woman.  “You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’”  replied Jesus,
12	OEB	John	4	18	“For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.”
12	OEB	John	4	19	“I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.
12	OEB	John	4	20	“It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.”
12	OEB	John	4	21	“Believe me,”  replied Jesus,  “a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.
12	OEB	John	4	22	You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.
12	OEB	John	4	23	But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.
12	OEB	John	4	24	God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.”
12	OEB	John	4	25	“I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.”
12	OEB	John	4	26	“I am he,”  Jesus said to her,  “I who am speaking to you.”
12	OEB	John	4	27	At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’
12	OEB	John	4	28	So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,
12	OEB	John	4	29	“Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”
12	OEB	John	4	30	And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.
12	OEB	John	4	31	Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.”
12	OEB	John	4	32	“I have food to eat,”  he answered,  “of which you know nothing.”
12	OEB	John	4	33	“Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.
12	OEB	John	4	34	“My food,”  replied Jesus,  “is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.
12	OEB	John	4	35	Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!
12	OEB	John	4	36	Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.
12	OEB	John	4	37	For here the proverb holds good – ‘One sows, another reaps.’
12	OEB	John	4	38	I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.”
12	OEB	John	4	39	Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’
12	OEB	John	4	40	And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
12	OEB	John	4	41	But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,
12	OEB	John	4	42	and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.”
12	OEB	John	4	43	After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;
12	OEB	John	4	44	for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’
12	OEB	John	4	45	When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.
12	OEB	John	4	46	So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.
12	OEB	John	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.
12	OEB	John	4	48	Jesus answered,  “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”
12	OEB	John	4	49	“Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.”
12	OEB	John	4	50	The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;
12	OEB	John	4	51	and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.
12	OEB	John	4	52	So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”
12	OEB	John	4	53	By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him  ‘Your son is living’ ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.
12	OEB	John	4	54	This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.
12	OEB	John	5	1	Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
12	OEB	John	5	2	There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades around it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’
12	OEB	John	5	3	In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled.
12	OEB	John	5	4	^[ 5:4 Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had.]
12	OEB	John	5	5	One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years.
12	OEB	John	5	6	Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him,  “Do you wish to be cured?”
12	OEB	John	5	7	“I have no one, Sir,” the sick man answered, “to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.”
12	OEB	John	5	8	“Stand up,”  said Jesus,  “take up your mat, and walk.”
12	OEB	John	5	9	The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking.
12	OEB	John	5	10	Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.”
12	OEB	John	5	11	“The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me  ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”
12	OEB	John	5	12	“Who was it,” they asked, “that said to you  ‘Take up your mat and walk’?”
12	OEB	John	5	13	But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there.
12	OEB	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him,  “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.”
12	OEB	John	5	15	The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.
12	OEB	John	5	16	And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.
12	OEB	John	5	17	But Jesus replied,  “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.”
12	OEB	John	5	18	This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God.
12	OEB	John	5	19	So Jesus made this further reply,  “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also.
12	OEB	John	5	20	For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder.
12	OEB	John	5	21	For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases.
12	OEB	John	5	22	The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son,
12	OEB	John	5	23	so that everyone may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him.
12	OEB	John	5	24	In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life.
12	OEB	John	5	25	In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live.
12	OEB	John	5	26	For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him;
12	OEB	John	5	27	and, because he is Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge.
12	OEB	John	5	28	Do not wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice,
12	OEB	John	5	29	and will come out – those who have done good rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for condemnation.
12	OEB	John	5	30	I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
12	OEB	John	5	31	“If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy;
12	OEB	John	5	32	it is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is trustworthy.
12	OEB	John	5	33	You have yourselves sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
12	OEB	John	5	34	But the testimony which I receive is not from people; I am saying this for your salvation.
12	OEB	John	5	35	He was the Lamp that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time, in his light.
12	OEB	John	5	36	But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than John’s; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out – the work that I am doing – is in itself proof that the Father has sent me as his messenger.
12	OEB	John	5	37	The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form;
12	OEB	John	5	38	and you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not believe him whom he sent as his messenger.
12	OEB	John	5	39	You search the scriptures, because you think that you find in them immortal life;  and, though it is those scriptures that bear testimony to me,
12	OEB	John	5	40	you refuse to come to me to have life.
12	OEB	John	5	41	“I do not receive honor from people,
12	OEB	John	5	42	but I know this of you, that you have not the love of God in your hearts.
12	OEB	John	5	43	I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
12	OEB	John	5	44	How can you believe in me, when you receive honor from one another and do not desire the honor which comes from the only God?
12	OEB	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes.
12	OEB	John	5	46	For, had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote;
12	OEB	John	5	47	but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my teaching?”
12	OEB	John	6	1	After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.
12	OEB	John	6	2	A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.
12	OEB	John	6	3	Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.
12	OEB	John	6	4	It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.
12	OEB	John	6	5	Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,  “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?”
12	OEB	John	6	6	He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.
12	OEB	John	6	7	“Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,” answered Philip, “it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.”
12	OEB	John	6	8	“There is a boy here,” said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother,
12	OEB	John	6	9	“Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?”
12	OEB	John	6	10	“Make the people sit down,”  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,
12	OEB	John	6	11	and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.
12	OEB	John	6	12	When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,  “Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.”
12	OEB	John	6	13	The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.
12	OEB	John	6	14	When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, “This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.”
12	OEB	John	6	15	But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone.
12	OEB	John	6	16	When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea,
12	OEB	John	6	17	and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;
12	OEB	John	6	18	the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.
12	OEB	John	6	19	When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.
12	OEB	John	6	20	But Jesus said to them,  “It is I; do not be afraid!”
12	OEB	John	6	21	And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.
12	OEB	John	6	22	The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.
12	OEB	John	6	23	Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.
12	OEB	John	6	24	So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.
12	OEB	John	6	25	And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?”
12	OEB	John	6	26	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied.
12	OEB	John	6	27	Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.”
12	OEB	John	6	28	“How,” they asked, “are we to do the work that God wants us to do?”
12	OEB	John	6	29	“The work that God wants you to do,”  answered Jesus,  “is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.”
12	OEB	John	6	30	“What sign, then,” they asked, “are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?
12	OEB	John	6	31	Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
12	OEB	John	6	32	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven;
12	OEB	John	6	33	for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.”
12	OEB	John	6	34	“Master,” they exclaimed, “give us that bread always!”
12	OEB	John	6	35	“I am the life-giving bread,”  Jesus said to them,  “whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst again.
12	OEB	John	6	36	But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me.
12	OEB	John	6	37	All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away.
12	OEB	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me;
12	OEB	John	6	39	and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day.
12	OEB	John	6	40	For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.”
12	OEB	John	6	41	The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying –  ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven.’
12	OEB	John	6	42	“Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,” they asked, “whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?”
12	OEB	John	6	43	“Do not murmur among yourselves,”  said Jesus in reply.
12	OEB	John	6	44	“No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day.
12	OEB	John	6	45	It is said in the prophets – ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me.
12	OEB	John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father.
12	OEB	John	6	47	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life.
12	OEB	John	6	48	I am the life-giving bread.
12	OEB	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died.
12	OEB	John	6	50	The bread that comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die.
12	OEB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
12	OEB	John	6	52	They began disputing with one another, “How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?”
12	OEB	John	6	53	“In truth I tell you,”  answered Jesus,  “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you.
12	OEB	John	6	54	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day.
12	OEB	John	6	55	For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink.
12	OEB	John	6	56	Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them.
12	OEB	John	6	57	As the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live because I live.
12	OEB	John	6	58	That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.”
12	OEB	John	6	59	All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.
12	OEB	John	6	60	On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?”
12	OEB	John	6	61	But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them,
12	OEB	John	6	62	“Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?
12	OEB	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life.
12	OEB	John	6	64	Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.”  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;
12	OEB	John	6	65	and he added,  “This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.”
12	OEB	John	6	66	After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.
12	OEB	John	6	67	So Jesus said to the Twelve,  “Do you also wish to leave me?”
12	OEB	John	6	68	But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;
12	OEB	John	6	69	and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
12	OEB	John	6	70	“Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?”  replied Jesus,  “and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.”
12	OEB	John	6	71	He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.
12	OEB	John	7	1	After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.
12	OEB	John	7	2	When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
12	OEB	John	7	3	his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.
12	OEB	John	7	4	For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”
12	OEB	John	7	5	For even his brothers did not believe in him.
12	OEB	John	7	6	“My time,”  answered Jesus,  “is not come yet, but your time is always here.
12	OEB	John	7	7	The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.
12	OEB	John	7	8	Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.”
12	OEB	John	7	9	After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.
12	OEB	John	7	10	But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.
12	OEB	John	7	11	The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;
12	OEB	John	7	12	and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’
12	OEB	John	7	13	No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities.
12	OEB	John	7	14	About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.
12	OEB	John	7	15	The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”
12	OEB	John	7	16	So, in reply, Jesus said,  “My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.
12	OEB	John	7	17	If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.
12	OEB	John	7	18	The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.
12	OEB	John	7	19	Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?”
12	OEB	John	7	20	“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”
12	OEB	John	7	21	“There was one thing I did,”  replied Jesus,  “at which you are all still wondering.
12	OEB	John	7	22	But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.
12	OEB	John	7	23	When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?
12	OEB	John	7	24	Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.”
12	OEB	John	7	25	At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?
12	OEB	John	7	26	Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?
12	OEB	John	7	27	Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”
12	OEB	John	7	28	Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said,  “Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.
12	OEB	John	7	29	I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.”
12	OEB	John	7	30	So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.
12	OEB	John	7	31	Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”
12	OEB	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;
12	OEB	John	7	33	at which Jesus said,  “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.
12	OEB	John	7	34	You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.”
12	OEB	John	7	35	“Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?
12	OEB	John	7	36	What does he mean by saying  ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”
12	OEB	John	7	37	On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed,  “If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me and drink.
12	OEB	John	7	38	From the heart of those who believe in me will flow, as is said in scripture, rivers of living water.”
12	OEB	John	7	39	(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)
12	OEB	John	7	40	Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;
12	OEB	John	7	41	others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?
12	OEB	John	7	42	Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”
12	OEB	John	7	43	So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.
12	OEB	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.
12	OEB	John	7	45	When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?”
12	OEB	John	7	46	“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.
12	OEB	John	7	47	“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.
12	OEB	John	7	48	“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?
12	OEB	John	7	49	As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”
12	OEB	John	7	50	But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,
12	OEB	John	7	51	“Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?”
12	OEB	John	7	52	“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”
12	OEB	John	7	53	And everyone went home
12	OEB	John	8	1	except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives^[ 8:1 This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.].
12	OEB	John	8	2	But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.
12	OEB	John	8	3	Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,
12	OEB	John	8	4	and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.
12	OEB	John	8	5	Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?”
12	OEB	John	8	6	They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
12	OEB	John	8	7	However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.”
12	OEB	John	8	8	And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
12	OEB	John	8	9	When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.
12	OEB	John	8	10	Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
12	OEB	John	8	11	“No one, Sir,” she answered.
12	OEB	John	8	12	Jesus again addressed the people.  “I am the light of the world,”  he said.  “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”
12	OEB	John	8	13	“You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.”
12	OEB	John	8	14	“Even if I bear testimony to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.
12	OEB	John	8	15	You judge by appearances; I judge no one.
12	OEB	John	8	16	Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.
12	OEB	John	8	17	Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.
12	OEB	John	8	18	I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.”
12	OEB	John	8	19	“Where is your father, then?”  they asked.  “You know neither me nor my Father,”  replied Jesus.  “If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.”
12	OEB	John	8	20	These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.
12	OEB	John	8	21	Jesus again spoke to the people.  “I am going away,”  he said,  “and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.”
12	OEB	John	8	22	“Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says –  ‘You cannot go where I am going’?”
12	OEB	John	8	23	“You,”  added Jesus,  “are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;
12	OEB	John	8	24	and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.”
12	OEB	John	8	25	“Who are you?” they asked.  “Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”  said Jesus.
12	OEB	John	8	26	“I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.”
12	OEB	John	8	27	They did not understand that he meant the Father.
12	OEB	John	8	28	So Jesus added,  “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.
12	OEB	John	8	29	Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.”
12	OEB	John	8	30	While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.
12	OEB	John	8	31	So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him,  “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;
12	OEB	John	8	32	and you will find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
12	OEB	John	8	33	“We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying  ‘you will be set free’?”
12	OEB	John	8	34	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
12	OEB	John	8	35	And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.
12	OEB	John	8	36	If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!
12	OEB	John	8	37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts.
12	OEB	John	8	38	I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”
12	OEB	John	8	39	“Our father is Abraham,” was their answer.  “If you are Abraham’s children,”  replied Jesus,  “do what Abraham did.
12	OEB	John	8	40	But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.
12	OEB	John	8	41	You are doing what your own father does.”
12	OEB	John	8	42	“If God were your Father,”  Jesus replied,  “you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger.
12	OEB	John	8	43	How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.
12	OEB	John	8	44	As for you, you are children of your father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.
12	OEB	John	8	45	But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.
12	OEB	John	8	46	Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth?
12	OEB	John	8	47	The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.”
12	OEB	John	8	48	“Aren’t we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?”
12	OEB	John	8	49	“I am not possessed by a demon,”  Jesus answered,  “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me.
12	OEB	John	8	50	Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides.
12	OEB	John	8	51	In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.”
12	OEB	John	8	52	“Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say  ‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’
12	OEB	John	8	53	Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?”
12	OEB	John	8	54	“If I do honor to myself,”  answered Jesus,  “such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor – and you say that he is your God;
12	OEB	John	8	55	and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart.
12	OEB	John	8	56	Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.”
12	OEB	John	8	57	“You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?”
12	OEB	John	8	58	“In truth I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “before Abraham existed I was.”
12	OEB	John	8	59	At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.
12	OEB	John	9	1	As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.
12	OEB	John	9	2	“Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
12	OEB	John	9	3	“Neither the man nor the parents,”  replied Jesus,  “but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him.
12	OEB	John	9	4	We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.
12	OEB	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
12	OEB	John	9	6	Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.
12	OEB	John	9	7	“Go,”  he said,  “and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam”  (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.
12	OEB	John	9	8	His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?”
12	OEB	John	9	9	“Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.”
12	OEB	John	9	10	“How did you get your sight, then?” they asked.
12	OEB	John	9	11	“The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said to me  ‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.”
12	OEB	John	9	12	“Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.
12	OEB	John	9	13	They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.
12	OEB	John	9	14	Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight.
12	OEB	John	9	15	So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put a paste on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.”
12	OEB	John	9	16	“The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.”
12	OEB	John	9	17	So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?”
12	OEB	John	9	18	The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.
12	OEB	John	9	19	“Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?”
12	OEB	John	9	20	“We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind;
12	OEB	John	9	21	but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.”
12	OEB	John	9	22	His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.
12	OEB	John	9	23	This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’
12	OEB	John	9	24	So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.”
12	OEB	John	9	25	“I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.”
12	OEB	John	9	26	“What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?”
12	OEB	John	9	27	“I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?”
12	OEB	John	9	28	“You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses.
12	OEB	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”
12	OEB	John	9	30	“Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight!
12	OEB	John	9	31	We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.
12	OEB	John	9	32	Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.
12	OEB	John	9	33	If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.”
12	OEB	John	9	34	“You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him.
12	OEB	John	9	35	Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked,  “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
12	OEB	John	9	36	“Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.”
12	OEB	John	9	37	“Not only have you seen him,”  said Jesus,  “but it is he who is now speaking to you.”
12	OEB	John	9	38	“Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him;
12	OEB	John	9	39	and Jesus added,  “It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.”
12	OEB	John	9	40	Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?”
12	OEB	John	9	41	“If you had been blind,”  replied Jesus,  “you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains.
12	OEB	John	10	1	In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;
12	OEB	John	10	2	but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep.
12	OEB	John	10	3	For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
12	OEB	John	10	4	When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
12	OEB	John	10	5	They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.”
12	OEB	John	10	6	This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking.
12	OEB	John	10	7	So he continued,  “In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep.
12	OEB	John	10	8	All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them.
12	OEB	John	10	9	I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.
12	OEB	John	10	10	The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.
12	OEB	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.
12	OEB	John	10	12	The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.
12	OEB	John	10	13	He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep.
12	OEB	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me –
12	OEB	John	10	15	Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep.
12	OEB	John	10	16	I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd.
12	OEB	John	10	17	This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again.
12	OEB	John	10	18	No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.”
12	OEB	John	10	19	In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people.
12	OEB	John	10	20	Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?”
12	OEB	John	10	21	Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?”
12	OEB	John	10	22	Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem.
12	OEB	John	10	23	It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon,
12	OEB	John	10	24	when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.”
12	OEB	John	10	25	“I have told you so,”  replied Jesus,  “and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me.
12	OEB	John	10	26	But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock.
12	OEB	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me;
12	OEB	John	10	28	and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.
12	OEB	John	10	29	What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands.
12	OEB	John	10	30	The Father and I are one.”
12	OEB	John	10	31	Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him;
12	OEB	John	10	32	and seeing this, Jesus said,  “I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?”
12	OEB	John	10	33	“It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.”
12	OEB	John	10	34	“Are there not,”  replied Jesus,  “these words in your Law – ‘I said, You are gods’?
12	OEB	John	10	35	If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ – and scripture cannot be set aside –
12	OEB	John	10	36	do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’?
12	OEB	John	10	37	If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me;
12	OEB	John	10	38	if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.”
12	OEB	John	10	39	The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.
12	OEB	John	10	40	Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.
12	OEB	John	10	41	“John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.”
12	OEB	John	10	42	And many learned to believe in Jesus there.
12	OEB	John	11	1	Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.
12	OEB	John	11	2	This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.
12	OEB	John	11	3	The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’;
12	OEB	John	11	4	and, when Jesus heard it, he said,  “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.”
12	OEB	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.
12	OEB	John	11	6	Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.
12	OEB	John	11	7	Then, after that, he said to his disciples,  “Let us go to Judea again.”
12	OEB	John	11	8	“Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?”
12	OEB	John	11	9	“Are not there twelve hours in the day?”  answered Jesus.  “If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun;
12	OEB	John	11	10	but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.”
12	OEB	John	11	11	And, when he had said this, he added,  “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.”
12	OEB	John	11	12	“If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples.
12	OEB	John	11	13	But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.
12	OEB	John	11	14	Then he said to them plainly,  “Lazarus is dead;
12	OEB	John	11	15	and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.”
12	OEB	John	11	16	At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”
12	OEB	John	11	17	When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.
12	OEB	John	11	18	Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,
12	OEB	John	11	19	a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother’s death.
12	OEB	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.
12	OEB	John	11	21	“Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
12	OEB	John	11	22	Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.”
12	OEB	John	11	23	“Your brother will rise to life,”  said Jesus.
12	OEB	John	11	24	“I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.”
12	OEB	John	11	25	“I am the resurrection and the life,”  said Jesus.  “He who believes in me will live, though he die;
12	OEB	John	11	26	and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
12	OEB	John	11	27	“Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”
12	OEB	John	11	28	After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.”
12	OEB	John	11	29	As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.
12	OEB	John	11	30	Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
12	OEB	John	11	31	So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
12	OEB	John	11	32	When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!”
12	OEB	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.
12	OEB	John	11	34	“Where have you buried him?”  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered.
12	OEB	John	11	35	Jesus burst into tears.
12	OEB	John	11	36	“How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed;
12	OEB	John	11	37	but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?”
12	OEB	John	11	38	Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.
12	OEB	John	11	39	“Move the stone away,”  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.”
12	OEB	John	11	40	“Didn’t I tell you,”  replied Jesus,  “that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?”
12	OEB	John	11	41	So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said,  “Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer;
12	OEB	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.”
12	OEB	John	11	43	Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice,  “Lazarus! Come out!”
12	OEB	John	11	44	The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth.  “Set him free,”  said Jesus,  “and let him go.”
12	OEB	John	11	45	In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.
12	OEB	John	11	46	Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.
12	OEB	John	11	47	The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?
12	OEB	John	11	48	If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and our nation.”
12	OEB	John	11	49	One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,
12	OEB	John	11	50	“You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”
12	OEB	John	11	51	Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –
12	OEB	John	11	52	And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.
12	OEB	John	11	53	So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.
12	OEB	John	11	54	In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
12	OEB	John	11	55	But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.
12	OEB	John	11	56	So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”
12	OEB	John	11	57	The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.
12	OEB	John	12	1	Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.
12	OEB	John	12	2	There a supper was given in his honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.
12	OEB	John	12	3	So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.
12	OEB	John	12	4	One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,
12	OEB	John	12	5	“Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?”
12	OEB	John	12	6	He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.
12	OEB	John	12	7	“Leave her alone,”  said Jesus,  “so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial.
12	OEB	John	12	8	The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.”
12	OEB	John	12	9	Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
12	OEB	John	12	10	The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,
12	OEB	John	12	11	because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.
12	OEB	John	12	12	On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,
12	OEB	John	12	13	and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord – the king of Israel!”
12	OEB	John	12	14	Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –
12	OEB	John	12	15	‘Fear not, people of Zion. Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey.’
12	OEB	John	12	16	His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.
12	OEB	John	12	17	Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.
12	OEB	John	12	18	This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.
12	OEB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!”
12	OEB	John	12	20	Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,
12	OEB	John	12	21	who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”
12	OEB	John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.
12	OEB	John	12	23	This was his reply –  “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.
12	OEB	John	12	24	In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful.
12	OEB	John	12	25	A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life.
12	OEB	John	12	26	If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them.
12	OEB	John	12	27	Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour –
12	OEB	John	12	28	Father, honor your own name.”  At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.”
12	OEB	John	12	29	The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.”
12	OEB	John	12	30	“It was not for my sake that the voice came,”  said Jesus,  “but for yours.
12	OEB	John	12	31	Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out;
12	OEB	John	12	32	and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”
12	OEB	John	12	33	By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.
12	OEB	John	12	34	“We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be  ‘lifted up’  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
12	OEB	John	12	35	“Only a little while longer,”  answered Jesus,  “will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going.
12	OEB	John	12	36	While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.”  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.
12	OEB	John	12	37	But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,
12	OEB	John	12	38	in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’
12	OEB	John	12	39	The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words –
12	OEB	John	12	40	‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.’
12	OEB	John	12	41	Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.
12	OEB	John	12	42	Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues;
12	OEB	John	12	43	for they valued honor from people more than honor from God.
12	OEB	John	12	44	But Jesus had proclaimed,  “He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me;
12	OEB	John	12	45	and he who sees me sees him who sent me.
12	OEB	John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness.
12	OEB	John	12	47	When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
12	OEB	John	12	48	He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day.
12	OEB	John	12	49	For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver.
12	OEB	John	12	50	And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.”
12	OEB	John	13	1	Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.
12	OEB	John	13	2	The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;
12	OEB	John	13	3	and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God –
12	OEB	John	13	4	rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist.
12	OEB	John	13	5	He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him.
12	OEB	John	13	6	When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?”
12	OEB	John	13	7	“You do not understand now what I am doing,”  replied Jesus,  “but you will learn by and by.”
12	OEB	John	13	8	“You will never wash my feet!” exclaimed Peter.  “Unless I wash you,”  answered Jesus,  “you have nothing in common with me.”
12	OEB	John	13	9	“Then, Master, not my feet only,” exclaimed Simon Peter, “but also my hands and my head.”
12	OEB	John	13	10	“He who has bathed,”  replied Jesus,  “has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,”  he said to the disciples,  “are clean, yet not all of you.”
12	OEB	John	13	11	For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said  ‘You are not all clean.’
12	OEB	John	13	12	When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again.  “Do you understand what I have been doing to you?”  he asked.
12	OEB	John	13	13	“You yourselves call me ‘the teacher’ and ‘the Master’, and you are right, for I am both.
12	OEB	John	13	14	If I, then – ‘the Master’ and ‘the teacher’ – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet;
12	OEB	John	13	15	for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you.
12	OEB	John	13	16	In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them.
12	OEB	John	13	17	Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them.
12	OEB	John	13	18	I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’
12	OEB	John	13	19	For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am.
12	OEB	John	13	20	In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.”
12	OEB	John	13	21	After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,  “In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.”
12	OEB	John	13	22	The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.
12	OEB	John	13	23	Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.
12	OEB	John	13	24	So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, “Tell me who it is that he means.”
12	OEB	John	13	25	Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, “Who is it, Master?”
12	OEB	John	13	26	“It is the one,”  answered Jesus,  “to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.”  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;
12	OEB	John	13	27	and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him,  “Do at once what you are going to do.”
12	OEB	John	13	28	But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas.
12	OEB	John	13	29	Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.
12	OEB	John	13	30	After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.
12	OEB	John	13	31	When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,  “Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him;
12	OEB	John	13	32	and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith.
12	OEB	John	13	33	My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – ‘You cannot come where I am going’ – I now say to you.
12	OEB	John	13	34	I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you.
12	OEB	John	13	35	It is by this that everyone will recognize you as my disciples – by your loving one another.”
12	OEB	John	13	36	“Where are you going, Master?” asked Peter.  “I am going where you cannot now follow me,”  answered Jesus,  “but you will follow me later.”
12	OEB	John	13	37	“Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.”
12	OEB	John	13	38	“Will you lay down your life for me?”  replied Jesus.  “In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times.
12	OEB	John	14	1	Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
12	OEB	John	14	2	In my Father’s home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.
12	OEB	John	14	3	And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am;
12	OEB	John	14	4	and you know the way to the place where I am going.”
12	OEB	John	14	5	“We do not know where you are going, Master,” said Thomas. “So how can we know the way?”
12	OEB	John	14	6	Jesus answered,  “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me.
12	OEB	John	14	7	If you had recognized me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognize him, indeed you have already seen him.”
12	OEB	John	14	8	“Master, show us the Father,” said Philip, “and we will be satisfied.”
12	OEB	John	14	9	“Have I been all this time among you,”  said Jesus,  “and yet you, Philip, have not recognized me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, ‘Show us the Father’?
12	OEB	John	14	10	Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work.
12	OEB	John	14	11	Believe me,” he said to them all, “when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself.
12	OEB	John	14	12	In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father.
12	OEB	John	14	13	Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honored in the Son.
12	OEB	John	14	14	If you ask anything, in my name, I will do it.
12	OEB	John	14	15	If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart,
12	OEB	John	14	16	and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you always – the Spirit of truth.
12	OEB	John	14	17	The world cannot receive this Spirit, because it does not see him or recognize him, but you recognize him, because he is always with you, and is within you.
12	OEB	John	14	18	I will not leave you bereaved; I will come to you.
12	OEB	John	14	19	In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living also.
12	OEB	John	14	20	At that time you will recognize that I am in union with the Father, and you with me, and I with you.
12	OEB	John	14	21	It is they who have my commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal myself to them.”
12	OEB	John	14	22	“What has happened, Master,” said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), “that you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”
12	OEB	John	14	23	“Whoever loves me,”  Jesus answered,  “will lay my message to heart; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
12	OEB	John	14	24	The person who does not love me will not lay my message to heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but comes from the Father who sent me.
12	OEB	John	14	25	I have told you all this while still with you,
12	OEB	John	14	26	but the helper – the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name – will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all that I have said to you.
12	OEB	John	14	27	Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, or dismayed.
12	OEB	John	14	28	You heard me say that I was going away and would return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
12	OEB	John	14	29	And this I have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you may still believe in me.
12	OEB	John	14	30	I will not talk with you much more, for the Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with me;
12	OEB	John	14	31	but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father, and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going.
12	OEB	John	15	1	“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower.
12	OEB	John	15	2	Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, so that it may bear more fruit.
12	OEB	John	15	3	You are already clean because of the message that I have given you.
12	OEB	John	15	4	Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me.
12	OEB	John	15	5	I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remains united to me, while I remain united to you – you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me.
12	OEB	John	15	6	If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt.
12	OEB	John	15	7	If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours.
12	OEB	John	15	8	It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honored.
12	OEB	John	15	9	As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.
12	OEB	John	15	10	If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father’s commands to heart and remain in his love.
12	OEB	John	15	11	I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete.
12	OEB	John	15	12	This is my command – love one another, as I have loved you.
12	OEB	John	15	13	No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends.
12	OEB	John	15	14	And you are my friends, if you do what I command you.
12	OEB	John	15	15	I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father.
12	OEB	John	15	16	It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name.
12	OEB	John	15	17	I am giving you these commands that you may love one another.
12	OEB	John	15	18	If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me.
12	OEB	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you.
12	OEB	John	15	20	Remember what I said to you – ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.
12	OEB	John	15	21	But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me.
12	OEB	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.
12	OEB	John	15	23	The person who hates me hates my Father also.
12	OEB	John	15	24	If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
12	OEB	John	15	25	And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – ‘They hated me without cause.’
12	OEB	John	15	26	But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me;
12	OEB	John	15	27	yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first.
12	OEB	John	16	1	“I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.
12	OEB	John	16	2	They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.
12	OEB	John	16	3	They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me.
12	OEB	John	16	4	But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.
12	OEB	John	16	5	I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – ‘Where are you going?’
12	OEB	John	16	6	Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.
12	OEB	John	16	7	Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.
12	OEB	John	16	8	And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment;
12	OEB	John	16	9	as to sin, for people do not believe in me;
12	OEB	John	16	10	as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;
12	OEB	John	16	11	as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.
12	OEB	John	16	12	I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.
12	OEB	John	16	13	Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.
12	OEB	John	16	14	He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
12	OEB	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.
12	OEB	John	16	16	In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.”
12	OEB	John	16	17	At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us  ‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’;  and by saying  ‘Because I am going to the Father’?
12	OEB	John	16	18	What does he mean by  ‘In a little while’?”  they said. “We do not know what he is speaking about.”
12	OEB	John	16	19	Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said,  “Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’?
12	OEB	John	16	20	In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy.
12	OEB	John	16	21	A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world.
12	OEB	John	16	22	You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.
12	OEB	John	16	23	And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name.
12	OEB	John	16	24	So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
12	OEB	John	16	25	I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly.
12	OEB	John	16	26	You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;
12	OEB	John	16	27	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.
12	OEB	John	16	28	I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.”
12	OEB	John	16	29	“At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.
12	OEB	John	16	30	Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.”
12	OEB	John	16	31	“Do you believe that already?”  Jesus answered.
12	OEB	John	16	32	“Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
12	OEB	John	16	33	I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.”
12	OEB	John	17	1	After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heavenwards, and said:
12	OEB	John	17	2	even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to everyone you have given him.
12	OEB	John	17	3	And the eternal life is this – to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent as your messenger.
12	OEB	John	17	4	I have honored you on earth by completing the work which you have given me to do;
12	OEB	John	17	5	and now do you honor me, Father, at your own side, with the honor which I had at your side before the world began.
12	OEB	John	17	6	I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart.
12	OEB	John	17	7	They recognize now that everything that you gave me was from you;
12	OEB	John	17	8	for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you have sent me as your messenger.
12	OEB	John	17	9	I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are your own –
12	OEB	John	17	10	All that is mine is yours, and all that is yours is mine – and I am honored in them.
12	OEB	John	17	11	Now I am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world, and I am to come to you. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of your name which you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are.
12	OEB	John	17	12	While I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul – in fulfillment of scripture.
12	OEB	John	17	13	But now I am to come to you; and I am speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts.
12	OEB	John	17	14	I have given them your message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.
12	OEB	John	17	15	I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from evil.
12	OEB	John	17	16	They do not belong to the world, even as I do not belong to the world.
12	OEB	John	17	17	Consecrate them by the truth; your message is truth.
12	OEB	John	17	18	Just as you have sent me as your messenger to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world.
12	OEB	John	17	19	And it is for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be truly consecrated.
12	OEB	John	17	20	But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message,
12	OEB	John	17	21	that they all may be one – that as you, Father, are in union with us – and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.
12	OEB	John	17	22	I have given them the honor which you have given me, so that they may be one as we are one –
12	OEB	John	17	23	I in union with them and you with me – so that they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me.
12	OEB	John	17	24	Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for you did love me before the beginning of the world.
12	OEB	John	17	25	Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger.
12	OEB	John	17	26	I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.”
12	OEB	John	18	1	When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.
12	OEB	John	18	2	The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.
12	OEB	John	18	3	So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
12	OEB	John	18	4	Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them,  “For whom are you looking?”
12	OEB	John	18	5	“Jesus of Nazareth,” was their answer.  “I am he,”  said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)
12	OEB	John	18	6	When Jesus said  ‘I am he,’  they drew back and fell to the ground.
12	OEB	John	18	7	So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
12	OEB	John	18	8	“I have already told you that I am he,”  replied Jesus,  “so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.”
12	OEB	John	18	9	This was in fulfillment of his words –  ‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’
12	OEB	John	18	10	At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
12	OEB	John	18	11	But Jesus said to Peter,  “Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?”
12	OEB	John	18	12	So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him,
12	OEB	John	18	13	and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
12	OEB	John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.
12	OEB	John	18	15	Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,
12	OEB	John	18	16	while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.
12	OEB	John	18	17	So the maidservant said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?”
12	OEB	John	18	18	The servants and guards were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.
12	OEB	John	18	19	The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
12	OEB	John	18	20	“For my part,”  answered Jesus,  “I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret.
12	OEB	John	18	21	Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.”
12	OEB	John	18	22	When Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.
12	OEB	John	18	23	“If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,”  replied Jesus,  “but if not, why do you strike me?”
12	OEB	John	18	24	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
12	OEB	John	18	25	Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.
12	OEB	John	18	26	One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?”
12	OEB	John	18	27	Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.
12	OEB	John	18	28	From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.
12	OEB	John	18	29	Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.
12	OEB	John	18	30	“If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.
12	OEB	John	18	31	“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.”
12	OEB	John	18	32	in fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.
12	OEB	John	18	33	After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
12	OEB	John	18	34	“Do you ask me that yourself?”  replied Jesus,  “or did others say it to you about me?”
12	OEB	John	18	35	“Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?”
12	OEB	John	18	36	“My kingly power,”  replied Jesus,  “is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.”
12	OEB	John	18	37	“So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate.  “Yes, it is true I am a king,”  answered Jesus.  “I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.”
12	OEB	John	18	38	“What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.
12	OEB	John	18	39	It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”
12	OEB	John	18	40	“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.
12	OEB	John	19	1	After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.
12	OEB	John	19	2	The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.
12	OEB	John	19	3	They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.
12	OEB	John	19	4	Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”
12	OEB	John	19	5	Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
12	OEB	John	19	6	When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
12	OEB	John	19	7	“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”
12	OEB	John	19	8	When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;
12	OEB	John	19	9	and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”
12	OEB	John	19	10	But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
12	OEB	John	19	11	“You would have no power over me at all,”  answered Jesus,  “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”
12	OEB	John	19	12	This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”
12	OEB	John	19	13	On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’
12	OEB	John	19	14	It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”
12	OEB	John	19	15	At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”
12	OEB	John	19	16	so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.
12	OEB	John	19	17	and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.
12	OEB	John	19	18	There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.
12	OEB	John	19	19	Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’
12	OEB	John	19	20	These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.
12	OEB	John	19	21	The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”
12	OEB	John	19	22	But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
12	OEB	John	19	23	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.
12	OEB	John	19	24	So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture –
12	OEB	John	19	25	Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.
12	OEB	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother,  “There is your son.”
12	OEB	John	19	27	Then he said to that disciple,  “There is your mother.”  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.
12	OEB	John	19	28	Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture,  “I am thirsty.”
12	OEB	John	19	29	There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.
12	OEB	John	19	30	When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed,  “All is finished!”  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.
12	OEB	John	19	31	It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
12	OEB	John	19	32	Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;
12	OEB	John	19	33	but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
12	OEB	John	19	34	One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.
12	OEB	John	19	35	This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.
12	OEB	John	19	36	For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’
12	OEB	John	19	37	And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’
12	OEB	John	19	38	After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.
12	OEB	John	19	39	Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.
12	OEB	John	19	40	They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.
12	OEB	John	19	41	At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.
12	OEB	John	19	42	And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
12	OEB	John	20	1	On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.
12	OEB	John	20	2	So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”
12	OEB	John	20	3	So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.
12	OEB	John	20	4	The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.
12	OEB	John	20	5	Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.
12	OEB	John	20	6	Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,
12	OEB	John	20	7	and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.
12	OEB	John	20	8	Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.
12	OEB	John	20	9	For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.
12	OEB	John	20	10	The disciples then returned to their companions.
12	OEB	John	20	11	Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,
12	OEB	John	20	12	and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.
12	OEB	John	20	13	“Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”
12	OEB	John	20	14	After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
12	OEB	John	20	15	“Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.”
12	OEB	John	20	16	“Mary!”  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).
12	OEB	John	20	17	“Do not hold me,”  Jesus said,  “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.”
12	OEB	John	20	18	Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.
12	OEB	John	20	19	In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  “Peace be with you”;
12	OEB	John	20	20	after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.
12	OEB	John	20	21	Again Jesus said to them,  “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.”
12	OEB	John	20	22	After saying this, he breathed on them, and said,  “Receive the Holy Spirit;
12	OEB	John	20	23	if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.”
12	OEB	John	20	24	But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came;
12	OEB	John	20	25	so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!”
12	OEB	John	20	26	A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said,  “Peace be with you.”
12	OEB	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas,  “Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.”
12	OEB	John	20	28	And Thomas exclaimed, “My Master, and my God!”
12	OEB	John	20	29	“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?”  said Jesus.  “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!”
12	OEB	John	20	30	There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book;
12	OEB	John	20	31	but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.
12	OEB	John	21	1	Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.
12	OEB	John	21	2	It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,
12	OEB	John	21	3	“I am going fishing.”
12	OEB	John	21	4	Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.
12	OEB	John	21	5	“My children,”  he said,  “have you anything to eat?”
12	OEB	John	21	6	“Cast your net to the right of the boat,”  he said,  “and you will find fish.”  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.
12	OEB	John	21	7	The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.
12	OEB	John	21	8	But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.
12	OEB	John	21	9	When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.
12	OEB	John	21	10	“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”  said Jesus.
12	OEB	John	21	11	So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.
12	OEB	John	21	12	“Come and have breakfast.” , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.
12	OEB	John	21	13	Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.
12	OEB	John	21	14	This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.
12	OEB	John	21	15	When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?”
12	OEB	John	21	16	Then, a second time, Jesus asked,  “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
12	OEB	John	21	17	The third time, Jesus said to him,  “Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.”
12	OEB	John	21	18	“In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.”
12	OEB	John	21	19	Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added,  “Follow me.”
12	OEB	John	21	20	Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.
12	OEB	John	21	21	Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?”
12	OEB	John	21	22	“If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”  answered Jesus,  “what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.”
12	OEB	John	21	23	So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said  “If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?”
12	OEB	John	21	24	It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.
12	OEB	John	21	25	There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.
12	WEB	1 John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life
12	WEB	1 John	1	2	(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);
12	WEB	1 John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us.  Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
12	WEB	1 John	1	4	And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.
12	WEB	1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
12	WEB	1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.
12	WEB	1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
12	WEB	1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
12	WEB	1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
12	WEB	1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
12	WEB	1 John	2	1	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.  If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
12	WEB	1 John	2	2	And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
12	WEB	1 John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.
12	WEB	1 John	2	4	One who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.
12	WEB	1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him.  This is how we know that we are in him:
12	WEB	1 John	2	6	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.
12	WEB	1 John	2	7	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.
12	WEB	1 John	2	8	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.
12	WEB	1 John	2	9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
12	WEB	1 John	2	10	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.
12	WEB	1 John	2	11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
12	WEB	1 John	2	12	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
12	WEB	1 John	2	13	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.
12	WEB	1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
12	WEB	1 John	2	15	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.
12	WEB	1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.
12	WEB	1 John	2	17	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.
12	WEB	1 John	2	18	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.
12	WEB	1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.
12	WEB	1 John	2	20	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.
12	WEB	1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
12	WEB	1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
12	WEB	1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.
12	WEB	1 John	2	24	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning.  If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.
12	WEB	1 John	2	25	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.
12	WEB	1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.
12	WEB	1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.
12	WEB	1 John	2	28	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
12	WEB	1 John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.
12	WEB	1 John	3	1	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!  For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.
12	WEB	1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be.  But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.
12	WEB	1 John	3	3	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
12	WEB	1 John	3	4	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.
12	WEB	1 John	3	5	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.
12	WEB	1 John	3	6	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.
12	WEB	1 John	3	7	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
12	WEB	1 John	3	8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
12	WEB	1 John	3	9	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.
12	WEB	1 John	3	10	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.  Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.
12	WEB	1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
12	WEB	1 John	3	12	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him?  Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
12	WEB	1 John	3	13	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
12	WEB	1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.  He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.
12	WEB	1 John	3	15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.
12	WEB	1 John	3	16	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
12	WEB	1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?
12	WEB	1 John	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and forever.  Amen.
12	WEB	1 John	3	18	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.
12	WEB	1 John	3	19	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,
12	WEB	1 John	3	20	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
12	WEB	1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;
12	WEB	1 John	3	22	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
12	WEB	1 John	3	23	This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.
12	WEB	1 John	3	24	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
12	WEB	1 John	4	1	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
12	WEB	1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
12	WEB	1 John	4	3	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.
12	WEB	1 John	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
12	WEB	1 John	4	5	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
12	WEB	1 John	4	6	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
12	WEB	1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.
12	WEB	1 John	4	8	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.
12	WEB	1 John	4	9	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
12	WEB	1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins.
12	WEB	1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.
12	WEB	1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.
12	WEB	1 John	4	13	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
12	WEB	1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
12	WEB	1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
12	WEB	1 John	4	16	We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.
12	WEB	1 John	4	17	In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.
12	WEB	1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made perfect in love.
12	WEB	1 John	4	19	We love Him, because he first loved us.
12	WEB	1 John	4	20	If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
12	WEB	1 John	4	21	This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.
12	WEB	1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him.
12	WEB	1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.
12	WEB	1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.
12	WEB	1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world:  your faith.
12	WEB	1 John	5	5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
12	WEB	1 John	5	6	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
12	WEB	1 John	5	7	For there are three who testify{Only a few recent manuscripts add in heaven:  the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.  And there are three that testify on earth}:
12	WEB	1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.
12	WEB	1 John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.
12	WEB	1 John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
12	WEB	1 John	5	11	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
12	WEB	1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life.  He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.
12	WEB	1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
12	WEB	1 John	5	14	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.
12	WEB	1 John	5	15	And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
12	WEB	1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.
12	WEB	1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.
12	WEB	1 John	5	18	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.
12	WEB	1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
12	WEB	1 John	5	20	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

13	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,

13	OEB	Philemon	1	1	From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	2	To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;
13	OEB	Philemon	1	3	may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	4	I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,
13	OEB	Philemon	1	5	because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;
13	OEB	Philemon	1	6	and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	7	I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s people have been cheered, friend, by you.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	8	And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,
13	OEB	Philemon	1	9	yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	10	I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	11	Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;
13	OEB	Philemon	1	12	and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	13	For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	14	But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	15	It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,
13	OEB	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!
13	OEB	Philemon	1	17	If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	18	If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	20	Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	21	Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	22	Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;
13	OEB	Philemon	1	24	and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.
13	OEB	Philemon	1	25	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	2	to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
13	WEB	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	5	hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
13	WEB	Philemon	1	6	that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	7	For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	8	Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	9	yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	10	I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,{Onesimus means useful.}
13	WEB	Philemon	1	11	who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back.  Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	13	whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	14	But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	17	If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	18	But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand:  I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).
13	WEB	Philemon	1	20	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	22	Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
13	WEB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
13	WEB	Philemon	1	24	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
13	WEB	Philemon	3	15	All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.  Amen.

14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	3	I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you:

14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	6	Being confident of this very thing: that he who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	7	As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that, in my bands and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	9	And this I pray: That your charity may more and more abound in knowledge and in all understanding:

14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	11	Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	12	Now, brethren, I desire you should know that the things which have happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	13	So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court and in all other places.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	15	Some indeed, even out of envy and contention: but some also for good will preach Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	16	Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	17	And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	18	But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	20	According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded: but with all confidence, as always, so now also, shall Christ be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	21	For to me, to live is Christ: and to die is gain.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	22	And if to live in the flesh: this is to me the fruit of labour. And what I shall choose I know not. This is to me, etc.... His meaning is, that although his dying immediately for Christ would be his gain, by putting him presently in possession of heaven; yet he is doubtful what he should choose, because by staying longer in the flesh, he should be more beneficial to the souls of his neighbours.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	23	But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	24	But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	26	That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	28	And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me and now have heard of me. Philippians Chapter 2 He recommends them to unity and humility, and to work out their salvation with fear and trembling.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	2	Fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through contention: neither by vain glory. But in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	4	Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men’s.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	5	For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	6	Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	7	But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man. Emptied himself, exinanivit.... made himself as of no account.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	8	He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	9	For which cause, God also hath exalted him and hath given him a name which is above all names:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	10	That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	12	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation. With fear, etc.... This is against the false faith, and presumptuous security of modern sectaries.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	13	For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	14	And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	15	That you may be blameless and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation: among whom you shine as lights in the world.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ: because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	17	Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	18	And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate with me.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	19	And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	20	For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	21	For all seek the things that are their own not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	22	Now know ye the proof of him: that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately: so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	24	And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you shortly.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	25	But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier, but your apostle: and he that hath ministered to my wants.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	26	For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him. And not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	28	Therefore, I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord: and treat with honour such as he is.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service. Philippians Chapter 3 He warneth them against false teachers. He counts all other things loss, that he may gain Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	1	As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you is necessary.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs: beware of evil workers: beware of the concision.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	5	Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews. According to the law, a Pharisee:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	6	According to zeal, persecuting the church of God: According to the justice that is in the law, conversing without blame.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	7	But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	8	Furthermore, I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	9	And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God: justice in faith.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	10	That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings: being made conformable to his death,
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	11	If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	12	Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	13	Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth myself to those that are before,
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	14	I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you,
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	17	Be ye followers of me, brethren: and observe them who walk so as you have our model.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping) that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction: whose God is their belly: and whose glory is in their shame: who mind earthly things.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	20	But our conversation is in heaven: from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	3	21	Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself. Philippians Chapter 4 He exhorts them to perseverance in all good and acknowledges their charitable contributions to him.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	1	Therefore my dearly beloved brethren and most desired, my joy and my crown: so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	2	I beg of Evodia and I beseech Syntyche to be of one mind in the Lord.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	3	And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always: again, I say, rejoice.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	5	Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	6	Be nothing solicitous: but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	8	For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline: think on these things. For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, etc.... Here the apostle enumerates general precepts of morality, which they ought to practise. Whatsoever things are true.... in words, in promises, in lawful oaths, etc., he commands rectitude of mind, and sincerity of heart. Whatsoever modest.... by these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. Whatsoever just.... That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest. Whatsoever holy.... by these words may be understood, that those who are in a religious state professed, or in holy orders, should lead a life of sanctity and chastity, according to the vows they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the virtuous life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow. Whatsoever lovely.... that is, to practise those good offices in society, that procure us the esteem and good will of our neighbours. Whatsoever of good fame.... That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline.... that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things.... that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of God might be with them.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	9	The things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, these do ye: and the God of peace shall be with you.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	10	Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	11	I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound (every where and in all things I am instructed): both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound and to suffer need.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	13	I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless, you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	15	And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	16	For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift: but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	18	But I have all and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	19	And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	20	Now to God and our Father be glory, world without end. Amen.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	21	Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	22	The brethren who are with me salute you. All the saints salute you: especially they that are of Caesar’s household.
14	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	10	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	16	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	17	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	20	According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	22	But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	2	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	6	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	15	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
14	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	1	To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	3	Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thanksgiving to God,
14	OEB	Philippians	1	4	always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –
14	OEB	Philippians	1	5	because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	6	For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	7	And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	8	God will bear me witness how I yearn for you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	9	And what I pray for is this – that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,
14	OEB	Philippians	1	10	until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,
14	OEB	Philippians	1	11	bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	12	Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	13	It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	14	And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	15	It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of jealousy and opposition, but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	16	The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	17	The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	18	But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	19	Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	20	And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as before, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,
14	OEB	Philippians	1	21	for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	22	But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!
14	OEB	Philippians	1	23	My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	24	But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	25	Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;
14	OEB	Philippians	1	26	so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	27	Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,
14	OEB	Philippians	1	28	without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	29	For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.
14	OEB	Philippians	1	30	You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	1	If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	2	I entreat you to make my happiness complete – live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	3	Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	4	considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	5	Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	6	Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	7	but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;
14	OEB	Philippians	2	8	he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross!
14	OEB	Philippians	2	9	And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	10	so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	12	Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	13	Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	14	In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	15	so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,
14	OEB	Philippians	2	16	offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	17	And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;
14	OEB	Philippians	2	18	and you must also rejoice and share my joy.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	19	I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	21	They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	22	But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	23	It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	24	And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	25	Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	26	For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	27	And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	28	I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	29	Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.
14	OEB	Philippians	2	30	For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	1	In conclusion, my friends, may all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	2	Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!
14	OEB	Philippians	3	3	For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;
14	OEB	Philippians	3	4	though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!
14	OEB	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;
14	OEB	Philippians	3	6	as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	7	But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	8	More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as rubbish, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;
14	OEB	Philippians	3	9	any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	10	Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,
14	OEB	Philippians	3	11	in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	13	For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,
14	OEB	Philippians	3	14	I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	15	Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	16	Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	17	My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	18	For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	19	The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.
14	OEB	Philippians	3	21	By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	1	So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	2	I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;
14	OEB	Philippians	4	3	yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	4	All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	5	Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	6	Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	7	Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	8	In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honor have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	9	All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	10	It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	11	Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	13	I can do everything through the strength of the one who makes me strong!
14	OEB	Philippians	4	14	Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	15	And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	16	Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	17	It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	18	My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	19	And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	20	To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	21	Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	22	All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.
14	OEB	Philippians	4	23	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers{or, superintendents, or bishops} and servants{Or, deacons}:
14	WEB	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God whenever I remember you,
14	WEB	Philippians	1	4	always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,
14	WEB	Philippians	1	5	for your partnership{The word translated partnership (koinonia) also means fellowship and sharing.} in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	7	It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	9	This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	10	so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	12	Now I desire to have you know, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	13	so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	14	and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	16	The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	17	but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	18	What does it matter?  Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
14	WEB	Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	22	But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't make known what I will choose.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	23	But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	24	Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	25	Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
14	WEB	Philippians	1	26	that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	27	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;
14	WEB	Philippians	1	28	and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
14	WEB	Philippians	1	29	Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,
14	WEB	Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	1	If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	2	make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
14	WEB	Philippians	2	3	doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;
14	WEB	Philippians	2	4	each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	5	Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	6	who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	8	And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	9	Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;
14	WEB	Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	12	So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	13	For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputes,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	15	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	16	holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	17	Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	18	In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	21	For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	22	But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	25	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;
14	WEB	Philippians	2	26	since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
14	WEB	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,
14	WEB	Philippians	2	30	because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
14	WEB	Philippians	3	4	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:
14	WEB	Philippians	3	5	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
14	WEB	Philippians	3	6	concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	7	However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	8	Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ
14	WEB	Philippians	3	9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
14	WEB	Philippians	3	10	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;
14	WEB	Philippians	3	11	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do.  Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,
14	WEB	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.  Let us be of the same mind.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	17	Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,
14	WEB	Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.
14	WEB	Philippians	3	20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
14	WEB	Philippians	3	21	who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	2	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	3	Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again I will say, Rejoice!
14	WEB	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness be known to all men.  The Lord is at hand.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	6	In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	8	Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	9	The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	14	However you did well that you shared in my affliction.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	18	But I have all things, and abound.  I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	19	My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!  Amen.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.  The brothers who are with me greet you.
14	WEB	Philippians	4	22	All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.
14	WEB	Philippians	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.  Amen.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	2	3	Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	2	4	He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	4	1	Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David. Unto the end.... Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.—Ibid.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	6	1	Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave. For the octave.... That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal life: and for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	6	7	I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	6	Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	7	Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	8	And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	9	The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	10	The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	11	Just is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	7	12	God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	3	Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	4	For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	5	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	6	Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	7	And hast set him over the works of thy hands.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover, the beasts also of the fields.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	8	9	The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, that pass through the paths of the sea.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	3	I will be glad, and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	4	When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	5	For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	6	Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	7	The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	8	But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	9	And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	10	And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	9	21	Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men. Here the late Hebrew doctors divide this psalm into two, making ver. 22 the beginning of Psalm 10. And again they join Psalms 146 and 147 into one, in order that the whole number of psalms should not exceed 150. And in this manner the psalms are numbered in the Protestant Bible. Psalm 10 according to the Hebrews. 9a:1. Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble? 9a:2. Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. 9a:3. For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. 9a:4. The sinner hath provoked the Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him: 9a:5. God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. 9a:6. For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. 9a:7. His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. 9a:8. He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may kill the innocent. 9a:9. His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. 9a:10. In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. 9a:11. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end. 9a:12. Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. 9a:13. Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. 9a:14. Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. 9a:15. Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. 9a:16. The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. 9a:17. The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. 9a:18. To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth. Psalms Chapter 10 In Domino confido. The just man’s confidence in God in the midst of persecutions.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	10	Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect. A free rain.... the manna, which rained plentifully from heaven, in favour of God’s inheritance, that is, of his people Israel: which was weakened indeed under a variety of afflictions, but was made perfect by God; that is, was still supported by divine providence, and brought on to the promised land. It agrees particularly to the church of Christ his true inheritance, which is plentifully watered with the free rain of heavenly grace; and through many infirmities, that is, crosses and tribulations, is made perfect, and fitted for eternal glory.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	14	If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold. If you sleep among the midst of lots (intermedios cleros, etc.)... Viz., in such dangers and persecutions, as if your enemies were casting lots for your goods and persons: or in the midst of the lots, (intermedios terminos, as St. Jerome renders it,) that is, upon the very bounds or borders of the dominions of your enemies: you shall be secure nevertheless under the divine protection; and shall be enabled to fly away, like a dove, with glittering wings and feathers shining like the palest and most precious gold; that is, with great increase of virtue, and glowing with the fervour of charity.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	15	When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be whited with snow in Selmon. Kings over her....

The church, which, Isa. 2.2, is called The mountain of the house of the Lord upon the top of mountains.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	17	Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end. Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?.... Why do you suppose or imagine there may be any other such curdled mountains?

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	18	The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place. The chariot of God....

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	24	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	27	In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of Israel. From the fountains of Israel.... From whom both Christ and his apostles sprung. By Benjamin, the holy fathers on this place understand St. Paul, who was of that tribe, named here a youth, because he was the last called to the apostleship. By the princes of Juda, Zabulon, and Nephthali, we may understand the other apostles, who were of the tribe of Juda; or of the tribes of Zabulon, and Nephthali, where our Lord began to preach, Matt. 4.13, etc.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	67	28	There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.

That is, the devils, who hide themselves in order to surprise their prey. Or by wild beasts, are here understood persecutors, who, for all their attempts against the Church, are but as weak reeds, which cannot prevail against them who are supported by the strength of the Almighty. The same are also called the congregation of bulls (from their rage against the Church) who assemble together all their kine, that is, the people their subjects, to exclude if they can, from Christ and his inheritance, his constant confessors, who are like silver tried by fire.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	5	They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	6	Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	7	Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart. Fatness.... Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them in their iniquity: and made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	8	They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	9	They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	10	Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them. Return here.... or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence which are set down in the following verses.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	11	And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	12	Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they have obtained riches.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	13	And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	14	And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	15	If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children. If I said, etc.... That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	16	I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	17	Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	18	But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down. Thou hast put it to them.... In punishment of their deceits, or for deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end, which, in their prosperity they never apprehended.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	19	How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	20	As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	21	For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	22	And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	23	I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	24	Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	25	For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	26	For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	27	For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	72	28	But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion. Psalms Chapter 73 Ut quid, Deus. A prayer of the church under grievous persecutions.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	1	Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	3	Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	4	And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs, Their ensigns, etc.... They have fixed their colours for signs and trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the temple: and they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place. This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the profanation of the temple by Antiochus.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	5	And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees,
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	6	They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	7	They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	8	They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	9	Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	10	How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	11	Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	12	But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	13	Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. The sea firm.... By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm walls, whilst Israel passed through: and destroying the Egyptians called here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their king: casting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	14	Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	15	Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers. Ethan rivers.... That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21.14.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	16	Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	17	Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	18	Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	19	Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	20	Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. The obscure of the earth.... Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled, that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	21	Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	22	Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	73	23	Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually. Psalms Chapter 74 Confitebimur tibi. There is a just judgment to come: therefore let the wicked take care.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	1	Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph. Corrupt not.... It is believed to have been the beginning of some ode or hymn, to the tune of which this psalm was to be sung. St. Augustine and other fathers take it to be an admonition of the spirit of God, not to faint or fail in our hope: but to persevere with constancy in good: because God will not fail in his due time to render to every man according to his works.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	2	We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	3	When I shall take a time, I will judge justices. When I shall take a time.... In proper times: particularly at the last day, when the earth shall melt away at the presence of the great Judge: the same who originally laid the foundations of it, and as it were established its pillars.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	4	The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	5	I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	6	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	7	For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	8	For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	9	For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	10	But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	74	11	And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. Psalms Chapter 75 Notus in Judaea. God is known in his church: and exerts his power in protecting it. It alludes to the slaughter of the Assyrians, in the days of king Ezechias.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	1	Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	2	In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	3	And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	4	There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	5	Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	6	All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	7	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	8	Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath. From that time, etc.... From the time that thy wrath shall break out.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	9	Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	10	When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	11	For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	12	Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	75	13	Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth. Psalms Chapter 76 Voce mea. The faithful have recourse to God in trouble of mind, with confidence in his mercy and power.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	1	Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	2	I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	3	In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	4	I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	5	My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	6	I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	7	And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	8	Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	9	Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	10	Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	11	And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	12	I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	13	And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	14	Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	15	Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	16	With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	17	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	18	Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	19	The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	20	Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	76	21	Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalms Chapter 77 Attendite. God’s great benefits to the people of Israel, notwithstanding their ingratitude.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	1	Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	2	I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. Propositions.... Deep and mysterious sayings. By this it appears that the historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep and mysterious: as being figures of great truths appertaining to the time of the New Testament.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	3	How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	4	They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	5	And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	6	That another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	7	That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	8	That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	9	The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	10	They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	11	And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	12	Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	13	He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	14	And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	15	He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	16	He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	17	And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	18	And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	19	And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	20	Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	21	Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	22	Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	23	And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	25	Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	26	He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the south-west wind.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	27	And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	28	And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	29	So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	30	they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	31	And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	32	In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	33	And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	35	And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	36	And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	37	But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	38	But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	39	And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	40	How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	41	And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	42	They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	43	How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	44	And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	45	He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	46	And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	47	And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	48	And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	49	And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	50	He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	51	And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	52	And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	53	And he brought them out in hope and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	54	And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	55	And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	56	Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	57	And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	58	They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	59	God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	60	And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	68	But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	69	And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. As of unicorns.... That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn. This is one of the chiefest of the propositions of this psalm, foreshewing the firm establishment of the one, true, and everlasting sanctuary of God, in his church.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	70	And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	71	To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	77	72	And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands. Psalms Chapter 78 Deus, venerunt gentes. The church in time of persecution prayeth for relief. It seems to belong to the time of the Machabees.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	2	They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	3	They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	5	How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	6	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	8	Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	78	9	Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name’s sake:

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	105	23	And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	105	24	And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word,

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	107	9	Galaad is mine: and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection of my head. Juda is my king:

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	108	5	And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	108	6	Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand. Set thou the sinner over him, etc.... Give to the devil, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty verses of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed our Lord; and are to be taken as prophetic denunciations of the evils that should befall the traitor and his accomplices the Jews; and not properly as curses.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	108	15	May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth:
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	108	16	because he remembered not to shew mercy,

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	108	18	And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.

The good man is happy. Alleluia, of the returning of Aggeus and Zacharias. Of the returning, etc.... This is in the Greek and Latin, but not in the Hebrew.

15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	113	2	Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	113	2	For thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake: lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	113	3	The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
15	DRB	The Book of Psalms	113	3	But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would.

The first eight verses of this psalm in the original begin with Aleph, which is the name of the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The second eight verses begin with Beth, the name of the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet; and so to the end of the whole alphabet, in all twenty-two letters, each letter having eight verses. This order is variously expounded by the holy fathers; which shews the difficulty of understanding the holy scriptures, and consequently with what humility, and submission to the Church they are to be read.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	72	16	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	72	20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	1	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	3	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	4	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	5	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	6	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	7	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	8	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	9	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	10	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	11	And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	12	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	13	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	14	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	15	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	16	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	17	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	19	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	20	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	21	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	22	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	24	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	73	28	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	3	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	4	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	5	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	6	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	9	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	12	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	16	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	74	23	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	2	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	4	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	5	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	6	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	75	7	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	9	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	10	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	11	Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	76	12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	1	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	3	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	4	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	6	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	10	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	11	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	77	20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	25	Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	78	72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	1	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	79	13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	4	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	5	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	80	9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	15	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	35	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	36	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	106	38	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	107	13	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
15	KJV	The Book of Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.

15	OEB	Psalms	4	6	Many are longing
15	OEB	Psalms	4	7	You have put in my heart, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	4	8	So in peace I will
15	OEB	Psalms	5	1	Hear my words, LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	5	2	Attend to my loud cry for help,
15	OEB	Psalms	5	3	When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning,
15	OEB	Psalms	5	4	For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:

15	OEB	Psalms	5	6	You destroy all speakers of lies,
15	OEB	Psalms	5	7	But I, through your kindness abundant,
15	OEB	Psalms	5	8	Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness
15	OEB	Psalms	5	9	For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
15	OEB	Psalms	5	10	Condemn them, God;
15	OEB	Psalms	5	11	But let all who take refuge in you
15	OEB	Psalms	5	12	For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly,
15	OEB	Psalms	6	1	Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger,
15	OEB	Psalms	6	2	LORD, be gracious to me
15	OEB	Psalms	6	3	all of me utterly racked.
15	OEB	Psalms	6	4	Turn, LORD, rescue me;
15	OEB	Psalms	6	5	For in death none can call you to mind;

15	OEB	Psalms	6	7	My eyes swollen with grief;
15	OEB	Psalms	6	8	Begone, workers of wrong,
15	OEB	Psalms	6	9	the LORD  has heard my entreaty,
15	OEB	Psalms	6	10	My foes will be stricken with terror,
15	OEB	Psalms	7	1	LORD  my God, I take refuge in you.
15	OEB	Psalms	7	2	or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
15	OEB	Psalms	7	3	LORD, my God, if my life has been such
15	OEB	Psalms	7	4	if friends I paid back with evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	7	5	may the enemy chase and find me,

15	OEB	Psalms	7	12	He will sharpen his sword without fail,
15	OEB	Psalms	7	13	his deadly weapons are ready,
15	OEB	Psalms	7	14	The enemy who conceives evil;
15	OEB	Psalms	7	15	a pit they have made and dug;
15	OEB	Psalms	7	16	On their own heads their mischief comes back;
15	OEB	Psalms	7	17	I will give thanks to the LORD  for his justice,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	1	LORD  our God!
15	OEB	Psalms	8	2	from the mouths of children and infants.
15	OEB	Psalms	8	3	When I look at your heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	4	what are mortals,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	5	Yet you made them little less than divine,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	6	made them lord of the works of your hands,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	7	sheep and oxen,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	8	birds of the air,
15	OEB	Psalms	8	9	LORD  our God!
15	OEB	Psalms	9	1	With all my heart I will praise the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	2	I will rejoice and exult in you,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	3	because backward my foes were turned,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	4	My right and my claim you have upheld,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	5	rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	6	The foe is vanished, ruined forever,

15	OEB	Psalms	9	11	Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	12	As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	13	Show me favor, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	14	so I may, in your help exulting,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	15	The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	16	The LORD  is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	17	Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	18	For the needy will not be always forgotten,
15	OEB	Psalms	9	19	Arise, LORD ; don’t let them triumph:
15	OEB	Psalms	9	20	Strike them with fear, LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	10	1	Why do you stand, LORD, so far away,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	2	The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
15	OEB	Psalms	10	3	For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed;
15	OEB	Psalms	10	4	in wicked pride, thinks:
15	OEB	Psalms	10	5	Never a season that they do not prosper;
15	OEB	Psalms	10	6	Each says in their heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	7	Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression:
15	OEB	Psalms	10	8	Lying in secret in some village ambush,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	9	Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair
15	OEB	Psalms	10	10	Their victims are crushed,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	11	The wicked say in their hearts
15	OEB	Psalms	10	12	Arise, LORD, lift up your hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	13	Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	14	You have seen the trouble and sorrow;

15	OEB	Psalms	10	16	The LORD  is king forever and ever:
15	OEB	Psalms	10	17	LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble,
15	OEB	Psalms	10	18	rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
15	OEB	Psalms	11	1	In the LORD  I take refuge.
15	OEB	Psalms	11	2	“See! The wicked are bending the bow,
15	OEB	Psalms	11	3	In this tearing down of foundations

15	OEB	Psalms	11	6	On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,

15	OEB	Psalms	12	6	The words of the LORD  are words that are pure,
15	OEB	Psalms	12	7	You will keep us, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	12	8	in a world where the wicked prowl,
15	OEB	Psalms	13	1	How long, LORD, will you forget me forever?
15	OEB	Psalms	13	2	How long must I nurse grief inside me,
15	OEB	Psalms	13	3	Look at me, answer me, LORD  my God.
15	OEB	Psalms	13	4	lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
15	OEB	Psalms	13	5	But I trust in your kindness:

15	OEB	Psalms	14	1	Fools say in their heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	14	2	From heaven the LORD  looks out
15	OEB	Psalms	14	3	But all have turned bad,
15	OEB	Psalms	14	4	Have they learned their lesson,
15	OEB	Psalms	14	5	Sore afraid will they be;
15	OEB	Psalms	14	6	you may mock the plans of the poor,

15	OEB	Psalms	15	1	LORD, who can be guest in your tent?
15	OEB	Psalms	15	2	The person whose walk is blameless,
15	OEB	Psalms	15	3	on whose tongue there sits no slander,
15	OEB	Psalms	15	4	nor cruelly insult a neighbor,
15	OEB	Psalms	15	5	whose money is lent without interest,
15	OEB	Psalms	16	1	Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
15	OEB	Psalms	16	2	I said to the LORD, “You are my LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	16	3	Those who are holy in the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	16	4	Those who choose other gods
15	OEB	Psalms	16	5	The LORD  is my share and my portion,
15	OEB	Psalms	16	6	The boundary lines of my life
15	OEB	Psalms	16	7	I praise the LORD  for his counsel,
15	OEB	Psalms	16	8	I keep the LORD  always in mind:
15	OEB	Psalms	16	9	So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
15	OEB	Psalms	16	10	For you will not give me up to Sheol
15	OEB	Psalms	16	11	You will show me the path that leads to life,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	1	Listen, O LORD, to my innocence;
15	OEB	Psalms	17	2	Let my vindication come from you,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	3	When you test my heart when you visit at night,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	4	I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
15	OEB	Psalms	17	5	My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
15	OEB	Psalms	17	6	So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
15	OEB	Psalms	17	7	Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemies
15	OEB	Psalms	17	8	Keep me as the apple of the eye,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	9	From wicked people who do me violence,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	10	They have closed their hearts to pity,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	11	Now they dog us at every step,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	12	like a lion, longing to tear,
15	OEB	Psalms	17	13	Arise, LORD, face them and fell them.
15	OEB	Psalms	17	14	by your hand, O LORD, from those –
15	OEB	Psalms	17	15	In my innocence I will see your face,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	1	I love you, O LORD, my strength.
15	OEB	Psalms	18	2	The LORD  is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	3	Worthy of praise is the LORD  whom I call on,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	4	The waves of death broke about me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	5	Sheol threw cords around me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	6	In distress I cried to the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	7	Then the earth shook and quaked,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	8	Smoke went up from his nostrils,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	9	Then he bent the sky and came down,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	10	He rode on a cherub and flew,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	11	with his screen of darkness about him,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	12	At the radiance before him there passed
15	OEB	Psalms	18	13	The LORD  thundered from heaven,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	14	He shot his arrows and scattered them,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	15	The channels of the sea were revealed,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	16	He stretched from on high, he seized me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	17	and saved me from those who hated me –
15	OEB	Psalms	18	18	In my day of distress they assailed me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	19	To a spacious place he brought me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	20	The LORD  repays my innocence,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	21	For I kept the ways of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	22	His commandments were all before me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	23	And I was blameless before him,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	24	So the LORD  repaid my innocence,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	25	With the loyal you are loyal,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	26	With the pure you show yourself pure,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	27	For the lowly people you save,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	28	You are my lamp, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	29	With you I can storm a rampart,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	30	As for God, his way is perfect;
15	OEB	Psalms	18	31	For who is God but the LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	18	32	The God who arms me with strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	33	He made my feet like hinds’ feet,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	34	He taught my hands how to fight,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	35	The shield of your help you gave me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	36	In your strength I took giant strides,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	37	So I chased the foe till I caught them,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	38	I smashed them, they could not rise,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	39	You did arm me with strength for war,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	40	You made my foes turn their back to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	41	They cried for help, but none saved them;
15	OEB	Psalms	18	42	I beat them like dust of the market-place,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	43	From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	44	On the instant they hear, they obey me,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	45	Foreigners lose courage,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	46	The LORD  is alive! Blest be my rock!
15	OEB	Psalms	18	47	The God who gave me revenge,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	48	who saved me from angry foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	49	For this I will praise you among the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	18	50	for great triumphs he grants to his king,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	1	The heavens declare God’s glory,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	2	Day tells it to day,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	3	without speaking, without words;
15	OEB	Psalms	19	4	But through all the world their voice carries
15	OEB	Psalms	19	5	it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	6	From one end of the heavens it rises,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	7	The law of the LORD  is perfect,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	8	The behests of the LORD  are right,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	9	The fear of the LORD  is clean,
15	OEB	Psalms	19	10	More precious are they than gold –
15	OEB	Psalms	19	11	By them is your servant warned;
15	OEB	Psalms	19	12	Who can know their flaws?
15	OEB	Psalms	19	13	Keep your servant from wilful sins –
15	OEB	Psalms	19	14	May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
15	OEB	Psalms	20	1	The LORD  answer you in the day of distress,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	2	sending you help from the temple,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	3	All your meal-offerings may he remember,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	4	May he grant you your heart’s desire,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	5	We will shout then for joy at your victory,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	6	Now I am sure that the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	20	7	Some in chariots are strong, some in horses;
15	OEB	Psalms	20	8	They will totter and fall,
15	OEB	Psalms	20	9	Give victory, LORD, to the king,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	1	The king rejoices, LORD, in your might,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	2	You have granted to him his heart’s desire,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	3	You came to meet him with rich blessings,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	4	He asked you for life, you gave it –
15	OEB	Psalms	21	5	Great is his glory because of your help,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	6	For you make him most blessed forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	7	For the king puts always his trust in the LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	21	8	Your hand will reach all your foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	9	You will make them like a furnace of fire,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	10	You will sweep their offspring from the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	11	When they scheme against you
15	OEB	Psalms	21	12	For you aim your bow at their faces,
15	OEB	Psalms	21	13	Be exalted, LORD, in your strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	1	My God, my God, why have you left me,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	2	I cry in the day, you do not answer,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	3	You are the Holy One,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	4	In you our ancestors trusted,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	5	They cried to you, and found safety,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	6	But I am a worm, not a person;
15	OEB	Psalms	22	7	All who see me mock me,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	8	“He relies on the LORD ; let him save him.
15	OEB	Psalms	22	9	But you drew me from the womb,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	10	On your care was I cast from my very birth,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	11	Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	12	I am circled by many bulls,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	13	who face me with gaping jaws,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	14	Poured out am I like water,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	15	My palate is dry as a sherd,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	16	For dogs are round about me,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	17	I can count my bones, every one.
15	OEB	Psalms	22	18	They divide my garments among them,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	19	But you, O LORD, be not far,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	20	Deliver my life from the sword
15	OEB	Psalms	22	21	Save me from the jaws of the lion,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	22	I will tell of your fame to my kindred,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	23	Praise the LORD, you who fear him.
15	OEB	Psalms	22	24	For he has not despised nor abhorred
15	OEB	Psalms	22	25	Of you is my praise in the great congregation;
15	OEB	Psalms	22	26	The afflicted will eat to their heart’s desire,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	27	All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	28	For the kingdom belongs to the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	22	29	To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	22	30	My descendants will tell of the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	22	31	they will declare his righteousness
15	OEB	Psalms	23	1	The LORD  is my shepherd: I am never in need.
15	OEB	Psalms	23	2	He lays me down in green pastures.
15	OEB	Psalms	23	3	he refreshes my life.
15	OEB	Psalms	23	4	And when my way lies through a valley of gloom,
15	OEB	Psalms	23	5	You spread a table for me
15	OEB	Psalms	23	6	Surely goodness and love will pursue me –
15	OEB	Psalms	24	1	The earth is the LORD ’s and all that it holds,
15	OEB	Psalms	24	2	For he founded it on the seas,
15	OEB	Psalms	24	3	Who may ascend the hill of the LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	24	4	The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	24	5	they win from the LORD  a blessing:
15	OEB	Psalms	24	6	Such must be those who resort to him,
15	OEB	Psalms	24	7	Lift high your heads, you gates –
15	OEB	Psalms	24	8	“Who is the glorious king?”
15	OEB	Psalms	24	9	Lift high your heads, you gates –
15	OEB	Psalms	24	10	“Who is the glorious king?”
15	OEB	Psalms	25	1	To you, O LORD, I lift up my heart:
15	OEB	Psalms	25	2	In you I trust, put me not to shame;
15	OEB	Psalms	25	3	None will be shamed who wait for you,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	4	Make me, O LORD, to know your ways:
15	OEB	Psalms	25	5	In your faithfulness guide me and teach me,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	6	Remember your pity, O LORD, and your kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	7	Do not remember the sins of my youth;
15	OEB	Psalms	25	8	Good is the LORD  and upright,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	9	The humble he guides in the right,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	10	All his ways are loving and loyal
15	OEB	Psalms	25	11	Be true to your name LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	12	Who then is the person who fears the LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	25	13	They will live in prosperity,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	14	The LORD  gives guidance to those who fear him,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	15	My eyes are ever toward the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	16	Turn to me with your favor,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	17	In my heart are strain and storm;
15	OEB	Psalms	25	18	Look on my misery and trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	19	look on my foes oh, so many!
15	OEB	Psalms	25	20	Deliver me, keep me, and shame not
15	OEB	Psalms	25	21	May integrity and innocence preserve me,
15	OEB	Psalms	25	22	Redeem Israel, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	1	Defend me, O LORD, for my walk has been blameless;
15	OEB	Psalms	26	2	Examine me, LORD, and test me;
15	OEB	Psalms	26	3	For your love is before my eyes,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	4	I never sat down with the worthless,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	5	I hate the assembly of knaves,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	6	but, with hands washed in innocence,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	7	singing loud songs of thanks,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	8	O LORD, I love your house,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	9	Do not gather me up with sinners;
15	OEB	Psalms	26	10	whose hands are stained with villainy,
15	OEB	Psalms	26	11	But my walk is blameless!
15	OEB	Psalms	26	12	My foot stands on even ground,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	1	The LORD  is my light and my savior;
15	OEB	Psalms	27	2	When the wicked drew near to assail me
15	OEB	Psalms	27	3	Though against me a host should encamp,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	4	One thing have I asked of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	5	For he will hide me in his shelter
15	OEB	Psalms	27	6	And now that my head he has lifted
15	OEB	Psalms	27	7	Hear, O LORD, my loud cry,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	8	My heart has said to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	9	Hide not your face from me,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	10	for father and mother have left me;
15	OEB	Psalms	27	11	Teach me your way, O LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	27	12	Give me not up, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	13	Firm is the faith I cherish,
15	OEB	Psalms	27	14	Let your heart be courageous and strong,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	1	Unto you, O LORD, do I cry;
15	OEB	Psalms	28	2	Hear my loud entreaty,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	3	Take me not off with the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	4	Give them as they have done,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	5	They are blind to all that the LORD  does,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	6	Blest be the LORD, who has heard
15	OEB	Psalms	28	7	The LORD  is my strength and my shield;
15	OEB	Psalms	28	8	The LORD  is the strength of his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	28	9	O save your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	1	Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	2	Ascribe to the LORD  the glory he manifests:
15	OEB	Psalms	29	3	The LORD ’s voice peals on the waters.
15	OEB	Psalms	29	4	The LORD ’s voice sounds with strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	5	The LORD ’s voice breaks the cedars,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	6	making Lebanon dance like a calf,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	7	The LORD ’s voice hews out flames of fire.
15	OEB	Psalms	29	8	The LORD ’s voice rends the desert,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	9	The LORD ’s voice whirls the oaks,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	10	The LORD  was king at the flood,
15	OEB	Psalms	29	11	The LORD  gives strength to his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	1	I will extol you, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	2	I cried to you for help,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	3	You have brought me up, LORD, from Sheol,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	4	Sing praise to the LORD, faithful people;
15	OEB	Psalms	30	5	For his anger lasts only a moment,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	6	When all went well, I imagined
15	OEB	Psalms	30	7	For by your favor, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	8	Then to you, LORD, I cried,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	9	“What profit is there in my blood,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	10	Hear, LORD, and show me your favor,
15	OEB	Psalms	30	11	You have turned my mourning to dancing;
15	OEB	Psalms	30	12	that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	1	In you, O LORD, I take refuge;
15	OEB	Psalms	31	2	incline to me your ear.
15	OEB	Psalms	31	3	For my rock and my fortress are you;
15	OEB	Psalms	31	4	Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	5	Into your hand I commend my spirit:
15	OEB	Psalms	31	6	I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
15	OEB	Psalms	31	7	I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	8	You have not given me into the enemy’s hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	9	Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed;
15	OEB	Psalms	31	10	For my life is consumed with grief,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	11	The scorn of all my foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	12	I am clean forgotten like the dead,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	13	I hear the whispers of many –
15	OEB	Psalms	31	14	But my trust is in you, LORD .
15	OEB	Psalms	31	15	my times are in your hand, save me
15	OEB	Psalms	31	16	Make your face to shine on your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	17	Put me not, O LORD, to shame,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	18	Strike the false lips dumb,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	19	How great is the goodness
15	OEB	Psalms	31	20	In your sheltering wings you hide them
15	OEB	Psalms	31	21	Blest be the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	31	22	For I had said in panic,
15	OEB	Psalms	31	23	Love the LORD, all you faithful;
15	OEB	Psalms	31	24	Let your hearts be courageous and strong,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	1	Happy those whose transgression is pardoned,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	2	Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	3	When I held my peace, my bones wore away
15	OEB	Psalms	32	4	for day and night did your hand
15	OEB	Psalms	32	5	I began to acknowledge my sin,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	6	For this cause let all who are faithful
15	OEB	Psalms	32	7	For you are my shelter,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	8	“With my eye steadfastly upon you,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	9	Do not be like the horse or the mule,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	10	The godless have many sorrows,
15	OEB	Psalms	32	11	Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous;
15	OEB	Psalms	33	1	Shout for joy in the LORD, you righteous:
15	OEB	Psalms	33	2	Give thanks to the LORD  on the lyre,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	3	Sing to him a new song,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	4	For the LORD  is straight in his promise;
15	OEB	Psalms	33	5	Justice and right he loves;
15	OEB	Psalms	33	6	By his word the heavens were made,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	7	He gathers the sea in a bottle,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	8	Let the whole world honor the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	9	For at his word it came into being,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	10	The LORD  frustrates the designs of the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	11	but the LORD ’s own design will stand forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	12	Happy the nation whose God is the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	13	The LORD  looks down from heaven,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	14	from where he rules he gazes
15	OEB	Psalms	33	15	He fashions the hearts of them all,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	16	It is not by great armies that kings are victorious,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	17	false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	18	See! The eye of the LORD  is on those who fear him,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	19	to deliver their life from death,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	20	We wait for the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	33	21	For in him our heart is glad,
15	OEB	Psalms	33	22	Let your kindness, O LORD, be upon us,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	1	I will bless the LORD  at all times,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	2	In the LORD  will my heart make her boast,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	3	O magnify the LORD  with me
15	OEB	Psalms	34	4	I sought the LORD, and, in answer,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	5	Look to him and you will be radiant,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	6	Here is one who was crushed,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	7	The LORD ’s angel encamps
15	OEB	Psalms	34	8	O taste and see that the LORD  is good,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	9	Fear the LORD, all his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	10	Even young lions may be poor and hungry,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	11	Come, children, listen to me.
15	OEB	Psalms	34	12	Which of you is desirous of life,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	13	Then guard your tongue from evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	14	Depart from evil, and do good;
15	OEB	Psalms	34	15	The eyes of the LORD  are towards the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	16	The LORD  sets his face against those who do evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	17	When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	18	The LORD  is near to the broken-hearted,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	19	Many misfortunes befall the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	20	He guards all their bones,
15	OEB	Psalms	34	21	Misfortune will slay the ungodly;
15	OEB	Psalms	34	22	The LORD  ransoms the life of his servants,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	1	Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	2	Grasp shield and buckler,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	3	Draw spear and battle-axe,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	4	Dishonor and shame be on those
15	OEB	Psalms	35	5	As chaff before wind may they be,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	6	Slippery and dark be their way,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	7	For they wantonly hid their net for me,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	8	Upon them may ruin come unawares;
15	OEB	Psalms	35	9	Then I will exult in the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	10	and all my being will say,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	11	Violent witnesses rise,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	12	Evil for good they requite me,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	13	But when *they* were sick, *I* put on sackcloth,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	14	as if for my friend or my brother.
15	OEB	Psalms	35	15	When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	16	impiously mocking and mocking,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	17	How long, LORD, will you look on?
15	OEB	Psalms	35	18	I will then give you thanks in the great congregation,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	19	Suffer not those to rejoice over me
15	OEB	Psalms	35	20	For it is not peace that they speak
15	OEB	Psalms	35	21	With wide open mouths they shout,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	22	But you have seen, too, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	23	Bestir you, awake, for my right
15	OEB	Psalms	35	24	You are just, LORD : win for me justice,
15	OEB	Psalms	35	25	inwardly saying, “Hurrah!
15	OEB	Psalms	35	26	Shame and confusion together
15	OEB	Psalms	35	27	Let such as delight in my cause
15	OEB	Psalms	35	28	Then my tongue will tell of your justice,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	1	Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	2	It flatters them in their eyes
15	OEB	Psalms	36	3	First, their speech becomes wicked and false,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	4	Then they plot deliberate wrong,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	5	Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	6	Your justice is like the great mountains,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	7	How precious your love, O God!
15	OEB	Psalms	36	8	They feast on the fat of your house,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	9	For with you is the fountain of life,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	10	O continue your grace to the faithful,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	11	Let no arrogant foot tread upon me,
15	OEB	Psalms	36	12	There the workers of wrong lie prostrate,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	1	Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	2	for, like grass, they will speedily wither,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	3	Trust in the LORD, and do good;
15	OEB	Psalms	37	4	then the LORD  will be your delight,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	5	Commit your way to the LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	37	6	making clear as the light your right,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	7	In silence and patience wait on the LORD .
15	OEB	Psalms	37	8	Desist from anger, abandon wrath:
15	OEB	Psalms	37	9	for evildoers will be cut off,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	10	Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish:
15	OEB	Psalms	37	11	But the humble will have the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	12	The wicked plots against the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	13	the LORD  laughs,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	14	The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	15	but their sword will pierce their own heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	16	Better is the righteous person’s little
15	OEB	Psalms	37	17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	18	The LORD  watches over the days of the blameless,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	19	They will not be shamed in the evil time,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	20	Because the wicked will perish:
15	OEB	Psalms	37	21	The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	22	For those blest by the LORD  inherit the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	23	The LORD  supports the steps
15	OEB	Psalms	37	24	Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	25	Never, from youth to age,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	26	They are ever lavishly lending,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	27	Turn away from evil and do good
15	OEB	Psalms	37	28	For the LORD  loves justice,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	29	But the land will belong to the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	30	The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	31	The law of their God is in their heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	32	The wicked watches the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	33	But the LORD  leaves them not in their hand:
15	OEB	Psalms	37	34	Wait on the LORD, and observe his way:
15	OEB	Psalms	37	35	I have seen the wicked exultant,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	36	But the moment I passed, they vanished!
15	OEB	Psalms	37	37	Preserve your honor and practise uprightness,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	38	But transgressors will perish together.
15	OEB	Psalms	37	39	The righteous are saved by the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	37	40	the LORD  helps and rescue them,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	1	Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	2	for your arrows have sunk into me,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	3	In my flesh is no soundness
15	OEB	Psalms	38	4	For that my guilt
15	OEB	Psalms	38	5	My wounds stink and fester,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	6	Bent and bowed am I utterly,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	7	My loins are filled with burning,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	8	I am utterly crushed and numb;
15	OEB	Psalms	38	9	LORD, you know all that I long for,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	10	My heart is throbbing,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	11	My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	12	They who aim at my life lay their snares,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	13	But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
15	OEB	Psalms	38	14	I am like one without hearing,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	15	For my hope, O LORD, is in you.
15	OEB	Psalms	38	16	when I utter the hope that those
15	OEB	Psalms	38	17	For I am ready to fall,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	18	I acknowledge my guilt,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	19	My wanton assailants are strong,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	20	who render me evil for good,
15	OEB	Psalms	38	21	Do not forsake me, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	38	22	Hasten to help me,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	1	I vowed to watch my words,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	2	I was silent and dumb,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	3	My heart grew hot within me;
15	OEB	Psalms	39	4	“Teach me, O LORD, my end,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	5	See! My days you have made but a span,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	6	it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	7	And now, what wait I for, LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	39	8	From all my transgressions deliver me;
15	OEB	Psalms	39	9	I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	10	Remove your stroke from off me:
15	OEB	Psalms	39	11	When you rebuke someone to punish their sins,
15	OEB	Psalms	39	12	Hear my prayer, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	39	13	Look away from me, let me smile again,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	1	For the LORD  I waited and waited,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	2	From the horrible pit he drew me,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	4	Happy the person who has put
15	OEB	Psalms	40	5	With us you have wrought in rich measure,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	6	In offerings bloody or bloodless
15	OEB	Psalms	40	7	Then said I, “Here I am,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	8	My delight, O God, is to do your will,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	9	Well, O LORD, you know
15	OEB	Psalms	40	10	not hiding it in my heart.
15	OEB	Psalms	40	11	So do not restrain, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	12	For evils that cannot be numbered
15	OEB	Psalms	40	13	O LORD, be pleased to deliver me,
15	OEB	Psalms	40	14	May those who are seeking my life
15	OEB	Psalms	40	15	May those who hurrah over me
15	OEB	Psalms	40	16	But may all who seek after you
15	OEB	Psalms	40	17	I am weak and needy,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	1	Happy are those who consider the weak;
15	OEB	Psalms	41	2	He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	3	The LORD  will sustain them on bed of languishing;
15	OEB	Psalms	41	4	For this cause I say, “LORD, show me your favor;
15	OEB	Psalms	41	5	My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	6	When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow;
15	OEB	Psalms	41	7	In secret they whisper together against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	8	“Some fatal disease has fastened upon him;
15	OEB	Psalms	41	9	My most trusted friend, on whom I relied,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	10	But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	11	By this will I know you delight in me:
15	OEB	Psalms	41	12	For my innocence you uphold me,
15	OEB	Psalms	41	13	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,*
15	OEB	Psalms	42	1	Like the hart which longs
15	OEB	Psalms	42	2	I thirst for God,
15	OEB	Psalms	42	3	My tears have been my food
15	OEB	Psalms	42	4	My heart floods with sorrow,
15	OEB	Psalms	42	5	Why am I downcast?
15	OEB	Psalms	42	6	I am sunk in my misery;
15	OEB	Psalms	42	7	Flood is calling to flood
15	OEB	Psalms	42	8	In the day I cry to the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	42	9	I say to God my rock,
15	OEB	Psalms	42	10	It pierces me to the heart
15	OEB	Psalms	42	11	Why am I downcast?
15	OEB	Psalms	43	1	Right me, defend my cause
15	OEB	Psalms	43	2	For you are God my protector:
15	OEB	Psalms	43	3	Send forth your light and your truth,
15	OEB	Psalms	43	4	Then will I go to God’s altar,
15	OEB	Psalms	43	5	Why am I downcast?
15	OEB	Psalms	44	1	O God, we have heard with our ears,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	2	uprooting and crushing the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	3	it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
15	OEB	Psalms	44	4	It was you, my king and my God,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	5	Through you we can thrust back our foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	6	for not in my bow do I trust,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	7	Our victory comes from you,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	8	In God we boast all the day long,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	9	Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	10	and in making us flee from the foe,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	11	You have let us be eaten like sheep,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	12	sold your people for a pittance,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	13	You have made us the butt of our neighbors,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	14	O’er the world you have made us a byword,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	15	My disgrace is forever before me,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	16	at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	17	All this has come upon us,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	18	Our heart has not turned back,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	19	that you thus should have crushed us down,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	20	Had we forgotten the name of our God,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	21	would God not have searched this out?
15	OEB	Psalms	44	22	But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	23	Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
15	OEB	Psalms	44	24	Why do you hide your face,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	25	For we have sunk down to the dust,
15	OEB	Psalms	44	26	Arise, come to our help:
15	OEB	Psalms	45	1	My heart is astir with beautiful words:
15	OEB	Psalms	45	2	Your beauty is more than mortal,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	3	Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh.
15	OEB	Psalms	45	4	Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride
15	OEB	Psalms	45	5	Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you:
15	OEB	Psalms	45	6	Your throne shall endure for ever and ever
15	OEB	Psalms	45	7	Right you love and wrong you hate:
15	OEB	Psalms	45	8	With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	9	King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	10	Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
15	OEB	Psalms	45	11	And when the king desires your beauty,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	12	So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	13	The king’s daughter is glorious altogether,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	14	In many-coloured robes she is led to the king,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	15	The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.
15	OEB	Psalms	45	16	May sons of yours take the place of your fathers,
15	OEB	Psalms	45	17	Your name will I celebrate world without end,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	1	God is our refuge and strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	2	So we have no fear, though earth should change,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	3	Let its waters roar and foam,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	4	A river there is, whose streams make glad
15	OEB	Psalms	46	5	God is within her: she cannot be shaken.
15	OEB	Psalms	46	6	Nations roared, kingdoms tottered:
15	OEB	Psalms	46	7	On our side is the LORD  of hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	8	Come and see what the LORD  has done,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	9	He stills wars to the ends of the earth –
15	OEB	Psalms	46	10	“Refrain; and know surely that I am God,
15	OEB	Psalms	46	11	On our side is the LORD  of Hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	1	Clap your hands, all you peoples:
15	OEB	Psalms	47	2	For the LORD  is most high and dread,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	3	He subdues the peoples under us,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	4	he chooses our heritage for us,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	5	God is gone up with a shout,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	6	Sing praise to our God, sing praises:
15	OEB	Psalms	47	7	For king of all earth is he:
15	OEB	Psalms	47	8	God is king over all the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	47	9	Princes of nations gather
15	OEB	Psalms	48	1	Great is the LORD  and worthy all praise
15	OEB	Psalms	48	2	that rises so fair,
15	OEB	Psalms	48	3	Once God made himself known
15	OEB	Psalms	48	4	For see! A concert of kings
15	OEB	Psalms	48	5	But one glance, and they were astounded;
15	OEB	Psalms	48	6	Trembling took hold of them there,
15	OEB	Psalms	48	7	They were shattered, as east wind shatters
15	OEB	Psalms	48	8	What we heard, we now have seen
15	OEB	Psalms	48	9	We think, O God, of your love,
15	OEB	Psalms	48	10	Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend
15	OEB	Psalms	48	11	Let mount Zion be glad;
15	OEB	Psalms	48	12	Walk about Zion, go round her;
15	OEB	Psalms	48	13	Set your mind on her ramparts,
15	OEB	Psalms	48	14	That such is God,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	1	Hear this, you peoples all;
15	OEB	Psalms	49	2	people of low degree and high,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	3	My mouth shall utter wisdom,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	4	I incline my ear to a proverb,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	5	Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	6	who put their trust in their wealth,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	7	For assuredly no one can ransom themselves,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	8	for the ransom of a life is costly,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	9	to keep them alive for ever and ever,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	10	But see it they will. Even wise people die,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	11	The grave is their everlasting home,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	12	Despite their wealth,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	13	This is the fate of the confident fool,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	14	Like sheep they descend to Sheol
15	OEB	Psalms	49	15	But God will assuredly ransom my life
15	OEB	Psalms	49	16	So be not afraid when someone grows rich,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	17	Not a shred of it all can they take when they die,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	18	Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	19	they must join their ancestors,
15	OEB	Psalms	49	20	The wealthy are without understanding,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	1	The LORD  God has spoken: He summons the earth
15	OEB	Psalms	50	2	From Zion, perfection of beauty,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	3	Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	4	He summons the heavens above
15	OEB	Psalms	50	5	Gather to him his saints
15	OEB	Psalms	50	6	that the heavens may declare his justice,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	7	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	8	Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
15	OEB	Psalms	50	9	Not a bullock will I take from your house,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	10	for all beasts of the forest are mine,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	11	I know all the birds of the air,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	12	Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	13	Am I such as to eat bulls’ flesh,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	14	Offer to God a thank-offering,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	15	Summon me in the day of distress,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	16	But to the wicked God says:
15	OEB	Psalms	50	17	while you yourself hate correction,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	18	When you see a thief, you run with them;
15	OEB	Psalms	50	19	You let your mouth loose for evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	20	You shamefully speak of your kin,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	21	And because I kept silence at this,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	22	“Now you who forget God, mark this,
15	OEB	Psalms	50	23	Those who bring a thank-offering honor me;
15	OEB	Psalms	51	1	In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	2	Wash me clean of my guilt,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	3	For well I know my transgressions,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	4	Against you, only you, have I sinned,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	5	See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	6	It’s the innermost truth you desire,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	7	Purge me clean with hyssop,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	8	Fill me with joy and gladness,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	9	Hide your face from my sins,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	10	Create me a clean heart, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	11	Cast me not forth from your presence,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	12	Give me back the joy of your help,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	13	I will teach your ways to transgressors,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	14	Save me from blood, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	15	Open my lips, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	16	For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	17	The sacrifice pleasing to God
15	OEB	Psalms	51	18	Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	51	19	Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	1	Why glory in mischief, you hero?
15	OEB	Psalms	52	2	Engulfing ruin you plot,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	3	Evil, not good, you love,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	4	But you love all words that devour,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	5	But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	6	Smitten with awe at the sight,
15	OEB	Psalms	52	7	“Look” (they will say) “at the hero
15	OEB	Psalms	52	8	But I am like a fresh olive-tree
15	OEB	Psalms	52	9	I will render you thanks for ever
15	OEB	Psalms	53	1	Fools say in their heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	53	2	From heaven God looks out
15	OEB	Psalms	53	3	But all have turned bad,
15	OEB	Psalms	53	4	Have they learned their lesson,
15	OEB	Psalms	53	5	Sore afraid will they be,
15	OEB	Psalms	53	6	If only help from Zion
15	OEB	Psalms	54	1	Save me, O God, by your name,
15	OEB	Psalms	54	2	Listen, O God, to my prayer,
15	OEB	Psalms	54	3	For proud men have risen against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	54	4	But see! God is my helper,
15	OEB	Psalms	54	5	Let their evil fall back on my foes:
15	OEB	Psalms	54	6	Then will I bring you glad sacrifice,
15	OEB	Psalms	54	7	for from all distress you have saved me,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	1	Listen, God, to my prayer.
15	OEB	Psalms	55	2	Hear me, and answer;
15	OEB	Psalms	55	3	I am wild with the noise of the foe,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	4	My heart shudders within me,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	5	fear and trembling attack me,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	6	O for the wings of a dove:
15	OEB	Psalms	55	7	I would wander far away,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	8	I would find myself a shelter
15	OEB	Psalms	55	9	Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans;
15	OEB	Psalms	55	10	By day and by night they make their rounds
15	OEB	Psalms	55	11	within is ruin.
15	OEB	Psalms	55	12	The taunts were not those of a foe
15	OEB	Psalms	55	13	but it was you, my equal,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	14	We used to be so close,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	15	May death suddenly take them,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	16	But I will call on God,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	17	Evening and morning and noon
15	OEB	Psalms	55	18	though I am attacked by many
15	OEB	Psalms	55	19	God, who sits on his ancient throne
15	OEB	Psalms	55	20	My friend turned against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	21	His mouth was smoother than butter,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	22	Cast your burden on the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	55	23	But you, God, will hurl them down
15	OEB	Psalms	56	1	O God, be gracious to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	2	All the day enemies trample me;
15	OEB	Psalms	56	3	In the day of my terror
15	OEB	Psalms	56	4	In God I maintain my cause,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	5	They torture me all the day,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	6	banded together in secret,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	7	Pay them out for their sin, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	8	You yourself count my wanderings.
15	OEB	Psalms	56	9	Then shall my foes be turned back
15	OEB	Psalms	56	10	In God I maintain my cause,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	11	In God I fearlessly trust,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	12	Your vows are upon me, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	56	13	because you have saved me from death,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	1	Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	2	I cry to the Most High God,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	3	He will send me his succour from heaven,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	4	In the midst of lions I lie,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	5	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	6	They set a net for my feet,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	8	awake, my soul.
15	OEB	Psalms	57	9	I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	10	for great to heaven is your love,
15	OEB	Psalms	57	11	Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	1	Do you speak what is right, you gods?
15	OEB	Psalms	58	2	In the land you practise iniquity – all of you;
15	OEB	Psalms	58	3	The wicked go astray from the womb
15	OEB	Psalms	58	4	Venom have they like the venom of snakes,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	5	and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	6	O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	7	May they melt away like running water!
15	OEB	Psalms	58	8	Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	9	Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots,
15	OEB	Psalms	58	10	The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous;
15	OEB	Psalms	58	11	People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded:
15	OEB	Psalms	59	1	Save me, O God, from my enemies;
15	OEB	Psalms	59	2	Save me from those who do wrong,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	3	For see! They lay ambush for me,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	4	they run and make ready. Awake!
15	OEB	Psalms	59	5	You, O LORD  of hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	6	At evening they come,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	7	Look at their venomous mouths,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	8	But you, LORD, laugh at them,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	9	My strength, I will sing to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	10	My God with his love will meet me,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	11	Slay them not, lest my people forget,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	12	In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	59	13	In your wrath make a clean end of them,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	14	At evening they come,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	15	They roam about for a feast,
15	OEB	Psalms	59	16	But I will sing of your might;
15	OEB	Psalms	59	17	My strength, I will sing praise to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	1	O God, you have spurned and broken us,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	2	You have shaken the land and cleft it;
15	OEB	Psalms	60	3	You have made your people drink hardship,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	4	You have given those who fear you a banner,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	5	for the rescue of your beloved.
15	OEB	Psalms	60	6	God did solemnly swear:
15	OEB	Psalms	60	7	Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	8	Moab the pot that I wash in,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	9	O to be brought to the fortified city!
15	OEB	Psalms	60	10	Have you not spurned us, O God?
15	OEB	Psalms	60	11	Grant us help from the foe,
15	OEB	Psalms	60	12	With God we shall yet do bravely:
15	OEB	Psalms	61	1	Hear my cry, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	61	2	From the ends of the earth I call
15	OEB	Psalms	61	3	For you are a refuge to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	61	4	O to be guest in your tent forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	61	5	For you, O God, do hear my vows,
15	OEB	Psalms	61	6	Add many days to the life of the king;
15	OEB	Psalms	61	7	In the presence of God be he throned forever;
15	OEB	Psalms	61	8	And I will sing praise to your name forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	1	I wait alone in silence for God;
15	OEB	Psalms	62	2	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	3	How long will you, all of you, batter a man,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	4	From his height
15	OEB	Psalms	62	5	I wait alone in silence for God;
15	OEB	Psalms	62	6	Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	7	On God rests my honor and safety,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	8	Trust in him, all you people assembled,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	9	The lowly are nought but a breath,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	10	Trust not in gain of extortion,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	11	One thing God has uttered,
15	OEB	Psalms	62	12	and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness;
15	OEB	Psalms	63	1	O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
15	OEB	Psalms	63	2	As I in the temple have seen you,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	3	for better than life is your kindness:
15	OEB	Psalms	63	4	So, while I live, I will bless you,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	5	As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
15	OEB	Psalms	63	6	I call you to mind on my bed,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	7	for you have been my help,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	8	I cling close after you,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	9	But those who seek after my life
15	OEB	Psalms	63	10	given o’er to the power of the sword,
15	OEB	Psalms	63	11	But the king shall rejoice in God:
15	OEB	Psalms	64	1	Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
15	OEB	Psalms	64	2	Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	3	who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	4	which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	5	They strengthen their wicked purpose,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	6	They think out their crimes full cunningly
15	OEB	Psalms	64	7	But God with his arrow will shoot them,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	8	For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	9	Then every person, touched to awe,
15	OEB	Psalms	64	10	In the LORD  shall the righteous rejoice,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	1	It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	2	O you who hear prayer,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	3	Our sins are too mighty for us,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	4	Happy the person who you choose
15	OEB	Psalms	65	5	In dread deeds you loyally answer us,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	6	By your strength you establish the hills,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	7	you still the roaring of seas,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	8	so that those who live at earth’s bounds
15	OEB	Psalms	65	9	You visit and water the earth;
15	OEB	Psalms	65	10	watering her furrows,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	11	You crown the year with your goodness,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	12	The desert pastures are lush,
15	OEB	Psalms	65	13	The meadows are clothed with flocks,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	1	Shout to God, all the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	2	sing praise to his glorious name,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	3	Say to God, “How dread are your works,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	4	All the earth does homage to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	5	Come and see what God has done,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	6	He turns the sea into dry land,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	7	the mighty Ruler eternal,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	8	O bless our God, you peoples;
15	OEB	Psalms	66	9	who keeps us in life,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	10	For you, God, have tested us,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	11	You did bring us into prison,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	12	you did let people ride over our head.
15	OEB	Psalms	66	13	I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	14	which my open lips have uttered,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	15	I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	16	Come and hear my story
15	OEB	Psalms	66	17	For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
15	OEB	Psalms	66	18	Had I cherished sin in my heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	19	But assuredly God has listened,
15	OEB	Psalms	66	20	Blessed be God, who turned not aside
15	OEB	Psalms	67	1	Bless us, O God, with your favor,
15	OEB	Psalms	67	2	that the world may know your way,
15	OEB	Psalms	67	3	Let the peoples praise you, O God;
15	OEB	Psalms	67	4	Let the nations ring out their joy;
15	OEB	Psalms	67	5	Let the peoples praise you, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	67	6	The earth has yielded her increase
15	OEB	Psalms	67	7	May this blessing of ours win people to him
15	OEB	Psalms	68	1	God arises, his enemies scatter:
15	OEB	Psalms	68	2	As smoke before wind is driven,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	3	But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	4	Sing to God, make music to his name,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	5	Father of orphans, defender of widows,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	6	God brings home the lonely,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	7	God, when you went in front of your people
15	OEB	Psalms	68	8	earth shook, the heavens poured rain
15	OEB	Psalms	68	9	Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	10	A dwelling therein your people found:
15	OEB	Psalms	68	11	The LORD  spoke the glad tidings of victory,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	12	“Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	13	dove’s wings covered with silver
15	OEB	Psalms	68	14	set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”
15	OEB	Psalms	68	15	A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	16	You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
15	OEB	Psalms	68	17	The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
15	OEB	Psalms	68	18	You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	19	Blest be the LORD  who sustains us daily,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	20	Our God is a God who is savior.
15	OEB	Psalms	68	21	Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
15	OEB	Psalms	68	22	The LORD  said: “I will bring you home from Bashan,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	23	that your feet you may bathe in blood,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	24	In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	25	with singers in front, and minstrels behind,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	26	“You of the well-spring of Israel,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	27	There, in front, is Benjamin the little,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	28	God, show your strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	29	from your temple that crowns Jerusalem.
15	OEB	Psalms	68	30	Rebuke the beast of the reed,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	31	May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	32	Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	33	Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens.
15	OEB	Psalms	68	34	Ascribe strength to the God over Israel,
15	OEB	Psalms	68	35	Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	1	Save me, O God; for the waters
15	OEB	Psalms	69	2	I am sunk in depths of mire,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	3	I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	4	More than the hairs of my head
15	OEB	Psalms	69	5	O God, you know my folly,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	6	Through me let not any be shamed,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	7	It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	8	I became to my kindred a foreigner,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	9	It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	10	When I chastened myself with fasting,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	11	When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	12	Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
15	OEB	Psalms	69	13	But I pray to you, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	14	from sinking down in the mire.
15	OEB	Psalms	69	15	that the rushing flood may not drown me,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	16	Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	17	Hide not your face from your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	18	Draw near to me, redeem me;
15	OEB	Psalms	69	19	You know how I am insulted;
15	OEB	Psalms	69	20	Insult has broken my heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	21	Poison they gave me for food,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	22	May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	23	May their eyes be darkened and blind,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	24	Pour your indignation upon them,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	25	May their camp be a desolation,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	26	For those whom you struck, they persecute,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	27	Charge them with sin upon sin,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	28	From the book of life be they blotted,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	29	Lift me, O God, by your help
15	OEB	Psalms	69	30	Then will I praise God in song
15	OEB	Psalms	69	31	which shall please the LORD  better than ox,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	32	The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
15	OEB	Psalms	69	33	For the LORD  listens to the poor,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	34	Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	35	For God will bring help to Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	69	36	His servants’ children shall have it for heritage,
15	OEB	Psalms	70	1	Quickly, God, deliver me,
15	OEB	Psalms	70	2	May those who are seeking my life,
15	OEB	Psalms	70	3	May those who delight in my hurt
15	OEB	Psalms	70	4	But may all who seek after you
15	OEB	Psalms	70	5	I am weak and needy:
15	OEB	Psalms	71	1	In you, O LORD, I take refuge,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	2	In your faithfulness save me and rescue me,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	3	Be to me a rock of defence,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	4	Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	5	For you, LORD, are my hope,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	6	On you have I leaned from my birth;
15	OEB	Psalms	71	7	I have been as a wonder to many,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	8	All the day long my mouth
15	OEB	Psalms	71	9	Cast me not off in the time of old age;
15	OEB	Psalms	71	10	For my foes whisper against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	11	“God has left him,” they say: “pursue
15	OEB	Psalms	71	12	O God, be not far from me,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	13	Put my foes to shame and dishonor,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	14	But I will never stop hoping,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	15	All the day long shall my mouth
15	OEB	Psalms	71	16	I will tell of the might of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	17	You have taught me, O God, from my youth,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	18	Even in old age and grey hair,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	19	Your power and your justice, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	20	You have caused us to see troubles many,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	21	You will multiply my greatness,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	22	So with harp I will praise you,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	23	My lips shall ring out their joy,
15	OEB	Psalms	71	24	Yes, all the day long shall my tongue
15	OEB	Psalms	72	1	Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
15	OEB	Psalms	72	2	that with right he may judge your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	3	May the mountains bear weal for the people,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	4	The weak may he help to their rights,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	5	May he live as long as the sun,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	6	May he be like the rain on the meadow,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	7	In his days may justice flourish,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	8	May he reign from ocean to ocean,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	9	May his foes bow down before him,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	10	May tribute be rendered by kings
15	OEB	Psalms	72	11	May all kings fall prostrate before him,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	12	For he saves the poor when he cries,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	13	He pities the weak and the poor,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	14	He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	15	Long may he live;
15	OEB	Psalms	72	16	May the land have abundance of corn,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	17	May his name be blessed forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	72	18	*Blest be the LORD  God, Israel’s God,*
15	OEB	Psalms	72	19	*And blest be forever his glorious name.*
15	OEB	Psalms	72	20	Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.
15	OEB	Psalms	73	1	Yes, God is good to the upright,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	2	But my feet were almost gone,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	3	through envy of godless braggarts,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	4	For never a pang have they,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	5	They have no trouble like mortals,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	6	So they wear their pride like a necklace,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	7	their eyes stand out with fatness,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	8	Their speech is mocking and evil,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	9	They have set their mouth in the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	10	Small wonder that people resort to them,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	11	“How does God know?” they say,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	12	See! These are the godless,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	13	Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	14	for all the day long was I plagued
15	OEB	Psalms	73	15	But to resolve to speak like they do
15	OEB	Psalms	73	16	So I sought to understand it,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	17	till I entered the holy world of God
15	OEB	Psalms	73	18	Yes, you set them on slippery places;
15	OEB	Psalms	73	19	One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
15	OEB	Psalms	73	20	Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	21	So my bitterness of mind
15	OEB	Psalms	73	22	show how dull I was and stupid
15	OEB	Psalms	73	23	But I am always with you,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	24	By a plan of yours you guide me
15	OEB	Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in the heavens but you?
15	OEB	Psalms	73	26	Though flesh and heart waste away,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	27	For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
15	OEB	Psalms	73	28	But I am happy when close to God;
15	OEB	Psalms	74	1	Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
15	OEB	Psalms	74	2	Remember the community you purchased of old
15	OEB	Psalms	74	3	Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
15	OEB	Psalms	74	4	Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	5	hacking, like woodsmen who lift
15	OEB	Psalms	74	6	smashing with hatchets and hammers
15	OEB	Psalms	74	7	They have set your temple on fire,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	8	They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.”
15	OEB	Psalms	74	9	No symbol of ours do we see any more:
15	OEB	Psalms	74	10	How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
15	OEB	Psalms	74	11	Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	12	Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	13	It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	14	It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	15	It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
15	OEB	Psalms	74	16	Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	17	It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
15	OEB	Psalms	74	18	Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	19	Do not give your dove to the beasts,
15	OEB	Psalms	74	20	Look to the sleek ones – how full they are:
15	OEB	Psalms	74	21	O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
15	OEB	Psalms	74	22	Arise, God, and defend your cause:
15	OEB	Psalms	74	23	Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	1	We praise you, God, we praise you:
15	OEB	Psalms	75	2	“At the time I choose,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	3	Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	4	I say to the boasters, “Boast not”;
15	OEB	Psalms	75	5	lift not your horn on high,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	6	For not from east nor west,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	7	but God himself is the judge,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	8	In the hand of the LORD  is a cup
15	OEB	Psalms	75	9	But I will rejoice forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	75	10	I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	1	God has made himself known in Judah,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	2	His tent is in Salem,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	3	There he broke the lightning arrows,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	4	Terrible is your splendor
15	OEB	Psalms	76	5	Despoiled were the stout of heart;
15	OEB	Psalms	76	6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	7	Awful are you: who can stand
15	OEB	Psalms	76	8	The judgment you gave from heaven
15	OEB	Psalms	76	9	when God arose to judgment
15	OEB	Psalms	76	10	The fiercest will praise you,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	11	Vow and pay to LORD  your God,
15	OEB	Psalms	76	12	He lops off the courage of princes,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	1	Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	77	3	When I think of God, I moan;
15	OEB	Psalms	77	4	When you hold my eyes awake,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	5	I think of the days of old,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	6	I commune with my heart in the night,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	7	“Will the LORD  cast us off forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	8	Has his love vanished forever?
15	OEB	Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	10	Then I said, “This it is that grieves me,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	11	I will think of the deeds of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	12	I will muse on all you have wrought,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	13	Then your way, O God, was majestic:
15	OEB	Psalms	77	14	You were a God who did marvels,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	15	by your arm you rescued your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	16	The waters saw you, O God.
15	OEB	Psalms	77	17	Clouds poured torrents of water,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	18	Loud was the roll of your thunder,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	19	In your way, LORD, through the sea,
15	OEB	Psalms	77	20	You did guide your folk like a flock
15	OEB	Psalms	78	1	My people, attend to my teaching:
15	OEB	Psalms	78	2	as I open my mouth in a poem
15	OEB	Psalms	78	3	What we have heard and known,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	4	we will not hide from their children.
15	OEB	Psalms	78	5	He set up a testimony in Jacob,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	6	that the next generation should know it,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	7	that in God they might put their confidence,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	8	and not be like their ancestors,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	9	Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	10	They did not keep God’s covenant,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	12	He did wonders before their ancestors
15	OEB	Psalms	78	13	Through the sea which he split he brought them,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	14	he led them by day with a cloud,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	15	From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams out of the rock,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on sinning against him,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	18	They willfully challenged God,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	19	“Is God able,” such was their challenge,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	20	From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	21	When the LORD  heard this, he was furious,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	22	For they put no trust in God,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	23	So he summoned the clouds above;
15	OEB	Psalms	78	24	he rained manna upon them for food,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	25	Everyone ate the bread of angels;
15	OEB	Psalms	78	26	He launched the east wind in the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	27	He rained meat upon them like dust,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	28	In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	29	They ate and were more than filled;
15	OEB	Psalms	78	30	But the thing they desired became loathsome:
15	OEB	Psalms	78	31	the wrath of God rose against them.
15	OEB	Psalms	78	32	Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days in a breath,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they sought after him,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	37	Their heart was not steady with him,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	38	But he is full of pity:
15	OEB	Psalms	78	39	So he remembered that they were but flesh,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	40	But how often they rebelled in the desert,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	41	tempting God again and again,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	42	They did not remember his strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	44	He turned their canals into blood,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	45	He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
15	OEB	Psalms	78	46	Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	47	He slew their vines with hail,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	48	He delivered their cattle to the hail,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	49	He let loose his hot anger among them,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	50	He cleared a path for his anger,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	51	He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	52	He led forth his people like sheep,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	53	Securely he led them, and free from fear,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	54	To his holy realm he brought them,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations before them,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	57	They drew back, false like their ancestors;
15	OEB	Psalms	78	58	Their shrines stirred him to anger,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	59	When God heard of this, he was furious,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	60	He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	61	He gave his strength up to captivity,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	62	He gave his people to the sword,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	65	Then the LORD  awoke as from sleep,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	66	and he beat back his foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	67	He disowned the tent of Joseph,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	68	but he chose the tribe of Judah,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	69	And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	70	And he chose David his servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	71	From the mother-ewes he brought him,
15	OEB	Psalms	78	72	With upright heart did he shepherd them,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	1	Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	2	They have given the bodies of your dead servants
15	OEB	Psalms	79	3	Round about Jerusalem
15	OEB	Psalms	79	4	On every side our neighbors
15	OEB	Psalms	79	5	How long will you be angry, O LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	7	For Jacob they devoured,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	8	Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins;
15	OEB	Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God our savior,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say,
15	OEB	Psalms	79	11	May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
15	OEB	Psalms	79	12	Pay our neighbors back sevenfold
15	OEB	Psalms	79	13	Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	1	Listen, Shepherd of Israel,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	2	before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.
15	OEB	Psalms	80	3	God, restore us:
15	OEB	Psalms	80	4	O LORD  of hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with bread of tears,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	6	The scorn of our neighbors you make us,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	7	God of hosts, restore us:
15	OEB	Psalms	80	8	A vine out of Egypt you brought;
15	OEB	Psalms	80	9	in the ground you did clear she struck root,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	10	The shade of her covered the mountains,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	11	She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	12	Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
15	OEB	Psalms	80	13	to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	14	O God of hosts, return:
15	OEB	Psalms	80	15	the vine which your right hand has planted.
15	OEB	Psalms	80	16	She is burned with fire and cut down
15	OEB	Psalms	80	17	Support the one you have chosen,
15	OEB	Psalms	80	18	then from you we will never draw back.
15	OEB	Psalms	80	19	LORD, God of hosts, restore us:
15	OEB	Psalms	81	1	Sing aloud to God our strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	3	On the new moon blow the horn,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	4	For this is a statute for Israel,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	5	a witness he set up in Joseph,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	6	“I removed from your shoulder the burden,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	7	At your call of distress I delivered you,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	8	“Listen, my people, to my warning,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	9	There must not be a strange god among you,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	10	I am the LORD  your God
15	OEB	Psalms	81	11	“But my people did not listen to my voice,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	12	So to their own hard hearts I left them,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	13	O that my people would listen,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	14	Soon would I humble their enemies,
15	OEB	Psalms	81	15	Those who hate the LORD  would cringe before him
15	OEB	Psalms	81	16	But you would I feed with the richest wheat,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	1	God has taken his stand
15	OEB	Psalms	82	2	“How long will you crookedly judge,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	3	Do right by the weak and the orphan,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and the needy,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	5	“They have neither knowledge nor insight,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	6	It was I who appointed you gods,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	7	Yet like mortals you will surely die,
15	OEB	Psalms	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	1	Do not keep silent, O God:
15	OEB	Psalms	83	2	For see! Your enemies roar,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	3	laying crafty plans for your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	4	“Come, let us wipe them out as a nation,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	5	For, conspiring with one accord,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	6	Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	8	Syria, too, is confederate,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	9	Deal with them as you dealt with Midian,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	10	who at Endor were destroyed,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	12	who said, “Let us take for ourselves
15	OEB	Psalms	83	13	Whirl them, my God, like dust,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	14	As the fire that kindles the forest,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	15	so with your tempest pursue them,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	16	Make them blush with shame;
15	OEB	Psalms	83	17	Everlasting shame and confusion,
15	OEB	Psalms	83	18	Teach those who you alone
15	OEB	Psalms	84	1	How dearly loved is the place where you live,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	2	How I long and yearn
15	OEB	Psalms	84	3	Even the sparrow has found her a home
15	OEB	Psalms	84	4	Happy those who live in your house,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	5	Happy those whose strength is in you,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	6	As they pass through the valley of tears,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	7	From rampart to rampart on they march,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	8	LORD, God of hosts, hear my prayer,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	9	Behold, O God, our defender,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	10	for better a single day in your courts
15	OEB	Psalms	84	11	for the LORD  is sun and shield,
15	OEB	Psalms	84	12	LORD  of hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	1	Once, LORD, you did favor your land,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	2	forgiving the guilt of your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	3	withdrawing all your fury,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	4	Restore us, O God our savior,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	5	Will you cherish your anger against us forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	6	Will you not revive us again,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	7	Show us your kindness, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	8	Let me hear what God the LORD  will speak;
15	OEB	Psalms	85	9	Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	10	Kindness and loyalty meet;
15	OEB	Psalms	85	11	Loyalty springs from the earth;
15	OEB	Psalms	85	12	The LORD  shall give all that is good,
15	OEB	Psalms	85	13	righteousness marching before him,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	1	Incline your ear, LORD, and answer me,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	2	Guard me, for I am loyal:
15	OEB	Psalms	86	3	LORD, be gracious to me, for you are my God;
15	OEB	Psalms	86	4	Gladden the heart of your servant;
15	OEB	Psalms	86	5	For you, LORD, are good and forgiving,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	6	Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
15	OEB	Psalms	86	7	In the day of my trouble I call on you,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	8	None of the gods is like you, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	9	All the nations you have made
15	OEB	Psalms	86	10	For great are you, and a doer of wonders;
15	OEB	Psalms	86	11	Teach me, O LORD, your way,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	12	I will give you thanks, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	13	For great is your love towards me,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	14	Haughty men have risen up against me, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	15	But you are a God of pity and grace,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	16	Grant your strength to your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	86	17	Show me a sign of your favor,
15	OEB	Psalms	87	1	On the holy mountain stands
15	OEB	Psalms	87	2	The LORD  loves the gates of Zion
15	OEB	Psalms	87	3	Glorious things he is speaking of you,
15	OEB	Psalms	87	4	“Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon,
15	OEB	Psalms	87	5	As for Zion it will be said
15	OEB	Psalms	87	6	The LORD  will count, when enrolling the peoples,
15	OEB	Psalms	87	7	Singers and dancers alike will say
15	OEB	Psalms	88	1	O LORD  my God,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	2	let my prayer come into your presence,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	3	For I am sated with sorrow,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	4	I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
15	OEB	Psalms	88	5	My home is among the dead,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	6	In the deepest pit you have put me,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	7	Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	8	You have put my friends far from me,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	9	my eyes are wasted with sorrow.
15	OEB	Psalms	88	10	For the dead can you work wonders?
15	OEB	Psalms	88	11	Can your kindness be told in the grave,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	12	Can your wonders be known in the darkness,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	13	I cry for help to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	14	Why, O LORD, do you spurn me,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	15	From my youth I am wretched and dying,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	16	The fires of your wrath have passed over me,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	17	surging around me forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	88	18	Those who love me you put far from me;
15	OEB	Psalms	89	1	I will sing evermore of the love of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	2	For your love you did promise to build up forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	3	“I have made with my chosen a covenant,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	4	to establish his seed forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	5	Then the holy assembly in heaven
15	OEB	Psalms	89	6	For who in the skies may compare with the LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	89	7	A God to be feared in the holy assembly,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	8	O LORD  God of hosts, who is mighty as you?
15	OEB	Psalms	89	9	You are the LORD  of the raging sea:
15	OEB	Psalms	89	10	It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	11	Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	12	The north and the south, it’s you have created them;

15	OEB	Psalms	89	18	For the holy LORD  of Israel
15	OEB	Psalms	89	19	In a vision of old you did speak
15	OEB	Psalms	89	20	“I found my servant David,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	21	My hand will be with him forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	22	“No enemy will dare to assail him,

15	OEB	Psalms	89	40	You have broken down all his walls,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	41	All who pass on their way despoil him,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	42	You have given his foes the victory,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	43	You have turned back his sword from the foe,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	44	The sceptre you took from his hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	45	You have shortened the days of his youth,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	46	How long, LORD  will you hide you forever?
15	OEB	Psalms	89	47	Remember, LORD, the shortness of life
15	OEB	Psalms	89	48	Who can live without seeing death?
15	OEB	Psalms	89	49	Where, LORD, is your kindness of old,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	50	Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	51	The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	89	52	*Blest be the LORD, for ever and ever.*
15	OEB	Psalms	90	1	LORD, you have been a home to us
15	OEB	Psalms	90	2	Before the mountains were born,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	3	You bring us back to the dust,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	4	For you see a thousand years
15	OEB	Psalms	90	5	Your floods sweep them away;
15	OEB	Psalms	90	6	which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	7	For your anger consumes us,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	8	Our sins you have set before you,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	9	For through your wrath our days are declining,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	10	The span of our life is seventy years,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	11	Who lays to heart the power of your anger?
15	OEB	Psalms	90	12	O teach us to count our days
15	OEB	Psalms	90	13	Return, O LORD ; why so long?
15	OEB	Psalms	90	14	Grant us your love to the full in the morning,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	15	Make us glad for the days you have humbled us,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	16	Let your servants see you in action,
15	OEB	Psalms	90	17	Let the grace of the LORD  our God be upon us,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	1	You whose home is the shelter of God Most High,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	2	can say to the LORD, “My refuge, my fortress,

15	OEB	Psalms	91	6	nor the plague that stalks in darkness,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	7	A thousand may fall at your side,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	8	You will only look on with your eyes,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	9	You have made the LORD  your refuge,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	10	You will never be met by misfortune,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	11	for he orders his angels to guard you,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	12	They will carry you with their hands,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	13	You will trample down lions and snakes,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	14	“Because of their love for me, I will deliver them,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	15	I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	91	16	I will give them a life of many days,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	1	It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	2	to declare your love in the morning,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	3	with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	4	For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	5	How great are your works, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	92	6	The insensitive cannot know,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	7	that, though the wicked flourish like grass,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	8	But you are exalted forever.
15	OEB	Psalms	92	9	For see! Your enemies, LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	92	10	But you lift me to honor,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	11	My eyes will feast on my foes,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	12	The righteous will sprout like the palm,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	13	In the house of the LORD  are they planted,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	14	They will still bear fruit in old age,
15	OEB	Psalms	92	15	So they proclaim the LORD  to be just,
15	OEB	Psalms	93	1	The LORD  has taken his seat on the throne,
15	OEB	Psalms	93	2	firm stands your throne from all eternity.
15	OEB	Psalms	93	3	The floods, O LORD, have lifted,
15	OEB	Psalms	93	4	But more grand than the great roaring waters,
15	OEB	Psalms	93	5	What you have ordained is most sure;
15	OEB	Psalms	94	1	LORD, God of vengeance,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	2	Rise up, judge of the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	3	LORD, how long shall the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	4	with their blustering arrogant words,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	5	crushing your people, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	6	murdering widows and strangers,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	7	They think that the LORD  does not see,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	8	Take heed, you dullest of people;
15	OEB	Psalms	94	9	Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
15	OEB	Psalms	94	10	Can he who trains nations not punish them
15	OEB	Psalms	94	11	The LORD  knows the thoughts of people,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	12	Happy are those whom you chasten,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	13	keeping them calm in the day of misfortune,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	14	For the LORD  will not leave his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	15	For the righteous shall come to their rights,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	16	Who will rise up for me against those who do evil?
15	OEB	Psalms	94	17	Were it not for the help of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	18	When I thought that my foot was slipping,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	19	When with cares my heart was crowded,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	20	Can corrupt justice be your ally,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	21	They assail the life of the righteous,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	22	But the LORD  is my sure retreat,
15	OEB	Psalms	94	23	He will bring back their sin upon them,
15	OEB	Psalms	95	1	Come! Let us ring out our joy to the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	95	2	Before his face let us come with thanks,
15	OEB	Psalms	95	3	For the LORD  is a great God,
15	OEB	Psalms	95	4	In his hand are the depths of the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	95	5	The sea is his, for he made it:

15	OEB	Psalms	102	2	Hide not your face from me
15	OEB	Psalms	102	3	For my days pass away like smoke:
15	OEB	Psalms	102	4	My heart is scorched, withered like grass;
15	OEB	Psalms	102	5	By reason of my loud groaning,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	6	Like a desert-owl of the wilderness,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	7	I make my sleepless lament
15	OEB	Psalms	102	8	All the day wild foes revile me,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	9	For ashes have been my bread,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	10	Because of your passionate anger,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	11	My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	12	But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	13	You will arise and have pity on Zion;
15	OEB	Psalms	102	14	For even her stones are dear to your servants,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	15	Then the nations will revere the name of the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	102	16	when the LORD  shall have built up Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	17	in response to the prayer of the destitute,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	18	Let this be recorded for ages to come,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	19	For he shall look down from his holy height,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	20	to hear the groans of the prisoner,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	21	that people may recount the LORD ’s fame in Zion,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	22	when the nations are gathered together,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	23	He has broken my strength on the way,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	24	I will say, “My God, take me not hence
15	OEB	Psalms	102	25	Of old you have founded the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	102	26	They shall perish; but you do stand.
15	OEB	Psalms	102	27	But you are the same, your years are endless.
15	OEB	Psalms	102	28	The children of your servants abide,

15	OEB	Psalms	103	4	He ransoms your life from the pit,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	5	He gives you your heart’s desire,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	6	The LORD  executes justice –
15	OEB	Psalms	103	7	He revealed his ways to Moses,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	8	Full of pity and grace is the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	9	he will not always chide,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	10	Not after our sins has he dealt with us,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	11	For high as the heavens o’er the earth
15	OEB	Psalms	103	12	Far as is east from the west
15	OEB	Psalms	103	13	As a father pities his children,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	14	for well he knows our frame,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	15	A person’s days are as grass;
15	OEB	Psalms	103	16	At the breath of the wind it is gone,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	17	But the love of the LORD  is eternal,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	18	to those who keep his covenant
15	OEB	Psalms	103	19	The LORD  has set his throne in the heavens;
15	OEB	Psalms	103	20	Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	21	Bless the LORD, all you his hosts,
15	OEB	Psalms	103	22	Bless the LORD, all you his works,

15	OEB	Psalms	104	2	covered with robe of light.
15	OEB	Psalms	104	3	He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
15	OEB	Psalms	104	4	He takes the winds for his messengers,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	5	He founded the earth upon pillars,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	6	With the garment of ocean he covered it,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	7	But at your rebuke they fled,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	8	mountains rose, valleys sank down
15	OEB	Psalms	104	9	They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	10	He sent brooks into the valleys,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	11	The wild beasts all drink from them,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	12	The birds have their home by the banks,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	13	From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	14	He makes grass grow for the cattle,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	15	wine, to gladden hearts;
15	OEB	Psalms	104	16	The trees of the LORD  drink their fill
15	OEB	Psalms	104	17	where the little birds build their nest,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	18	The high hills are for the wild goats,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	19	He created the moon to mark seasons,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	20	You make it dark: night comes,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	21	Young lions that roar for their prey,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	22	At sunrise they slink away,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	23	Then people go forth to their work,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	24	How many, O LORD, are your works,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	25	And there is the great broad sea,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	26	There go the ships,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	27	They all look in hope to you,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	28	And you give with open hand;
15	OEB	Psalms	104	29	When you hide your face, they are terrified;
15	OEB	Psalms	104	30	But a breath from your lips creates them,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	31	May the glory of the LORD  be forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	32	A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	33	I will sing to the LORD  while I live,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	34	May my musing be sweet to him,
15	OEB	Psalms	104	35	But may sinners be swept from the earth,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	1	Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name:
15	OEB	Psalms	105	2	Sing to him, make music to him,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	3	Make your boast in his holy name,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	4	Seek after the LORD  and his strength,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	5	Remember the wonders he did,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	6	you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	7	He is the LORD  our God:
15	OEB	Psalms	105	8	He remembers forever his covenant,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	9	The covenant he made with Abraham,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	10	and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	11	to give them the land of Canaan
15	OEB	Psalms	105	12	And when they were very few,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	13	wandering from nation to nation,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	14	he allowed no one to oppress them,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	15	He forbade them to touch his anointed,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	16	When he called down famine on the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	17	he sent before them a man,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	18	His feet were galled with fetters,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	19	till the time that his word came to pass,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	20	The king sent and freed him,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	21	He made him lord of his household,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	22	to admonish his princes at will
15	OEB	Psalms	105	23	Thus Israel came into Egypt,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	24	His people he made very fruitful,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	25	He inspired them to hate his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	26	He sent his servant Moses,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	27	portents he wrought in Egypt,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	28	Darkness he sent, and it fell:
15	OEB	Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	30	Their land was alive with frogs,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	31	At his command came flies,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail for rain
15	OEB	Psalms	105	33	smiting their vines and figs,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	34	At his command came locusts,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	35	which ate every herb in the land,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	36	He struck down in their land all the firstborn,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	37	Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they left,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud to screen them,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	40	He sent quails at their entreaty,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock; waters gushed:
15	OEB	Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy promise
15	OEB	Psalms	105	43	So he led out his people with joy,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	44	And he gave them the lands of the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	105	45	that so they might keep his statutes,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	1	Hallelujah!
15	OEB	Psalms	106	2	Who can describe his heroic deeds,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	3	Happy they who act justly,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	4	Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	5	May I see the good fortune of your elect,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	6	We, like our fathers, have sinned,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	7	In the land of Egypt our fathers,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	8	But true to his name he saved them,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
15	OEB	Psalms	106	10	saved from the hand of the hostile,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	11	The waters covered their enemies:
15	OEB	Psalms	106	12	So then they believed in his words,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	13	But soon they forgot his deeds:
15	OEB	Psalms	106	14	Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
15	OEB	Psalms	106	15	He gave them the thing they had asked for,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	16	The camp grew jealous of Moses
15	OEB	Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	18	Fire broke out on their company,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	20	They exchanged their glorious God
15	OEB	Psalms	106	21	They forgot the God who had saved them
15	OEB	Psalms	106	22	Wonders in the land of Ham,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	23	So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	24	They spurned the delightsome land,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	25	They grumbled in their tents,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	26	So he swore with uplifted hand
15	OEB	Psalms	106	27	to disperse their seed among heathen,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	28	Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	29	They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood between,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	31	and it was counted to him for righteousness
15	OEB	Psalms	106	32	They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	33	They rebelled against his spirit,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	35	but they mingled with the heathen,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	36	Their idol gods they worshipped,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	37	They sacrificed their sons
15	OEB	Psalms	106	38	They poured out innocent blood
15	OEB	Psalms	106	39	They became unclean by their works,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	40	Then the LORD ’s fury was on his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	41	He delivered them to the heathen,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	43	Many a time he saved them,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	44	Yet he looked upon their distress,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	45	He remembered his covenant,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	46	He caused them to be pitied
15	OEB	Psalms	106	47	Save us, O LORD  our God,
15	OEB	Psalms	106	48	*Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,*
15	OEB	Psalms	107	1	Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness
15	OEB	Psalms	107	2	Let this be the song of the ransomed,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	3	gathering them from all lands,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	4	In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	5	Full of hunger and thirst,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	6	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	7	guiding them straight on the way,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	8	Let them thank the LORD  for his kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	9	for the thirsty he satisfies,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness and gloom
15	OEB	Psalms	107	11	for rebelling against God’s word,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	12	Their heart was bowed with toil;
15	OEB	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	14	Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	15	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	16	For he shattered the gates of bronze,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	17	Some were sick from their wicked ways,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	18	All manner of food they hated;
15	OEB	Psalms	107	19	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	20	He sent his word and healed them,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	21	Let them praise the LORD  for his kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	22	Let them offer to him thankofferings,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	23	Some crossed the sea in ships,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	24	They have seen what the LORD  can do,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	25	At his command rose a tempest,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	26	Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
15	OEB	Psalms	107	27	They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
15	OEB	Psalms	107	28	Then they cried to the LORD  in their trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	29	He stilled the storm to a whisper,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	30	They were glad, because it was quiet;
15	OEB	Psalms	107	31	Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	32	Where the people assemble, extol him,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	33	He turns streams into a wilderness,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	34	fruitful land into a salt waste,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	35	A desert he makes pools of water,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	36	He settles the hungry therein,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	37	They sow fields and plant vineyards,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	38	By his blessing they multiply greatly,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	39	Yet when they are bowed and diminished
15	OEB	Psalms	107	40	he pours contempt upon princes,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	41	He lifts the poor out of misery,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	42	At this sight shall the upright be glad,
15	OEB	Psalms	107	43	Let those who are wise observe this,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	1	My heart is steadfast, O God,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	2	Awake, harp and lyre;
15	OEB	Psalms	108	3	I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	108	4	For great to heaven is your love,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	5	Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	6	So those you love may be rescued,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	7	God did solemnly swear:
15	OEB	Psalms	108	8	Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	9	Moab the pot that I wash in,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	10	O to be brought to the fortified city!
15	OEB	Psalms	108	11	Have you not spurned us, O God?
15	OEB	Psalms	108	12	Grant us help from the foe,
15	OEB	Psalms	108	13	With God we shall yet do bravely,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	1	O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
15	OEB	Psalms	109	2	for their wicked mouths they have opened against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	3	they beset me with words of hatred,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	4	My love they requite with hostility,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	5	Evil for good they reward me,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	6	“Set over him one who is godless,” they say,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	7	From his trial let him come forth guilty,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	8	Grant that his days may be few,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	9	Grant that his children be fatherless,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	10	Up and down may his children go begging,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	11	May all that he owns be seized by the creditor
15	OEB	Psalms	109	12	“May none extend to him kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	13	His descendants be doomed to destruction!
15	OEB	Psalms	109	14	May his father’s guilt be remembered,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	15	on record always before the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	16	for he gave no thought to show kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	17	“May the curses he loved light upon him,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	18	Like a garment he clothed him with curses;
15	OEB	Psalms	109	19	Let them be like the robe he wraps round him,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	20	Be this the reward of my adversaries,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	21	But you, LORD  my GOD ,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	22	For I am poor and needy,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	23	I am gone like a lengthening shadow,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	24	My knees totter from fasting,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	25	They heap insults upon me:
15	OEB	Psalms	109	26	Help me, O LORD  my God,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	27	Teach them that this is your hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	28	Let them curse, if only you bless.
15	OEB	Psalms	109	29	My opponents be clothed with dishonor,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	30	I give thanks to you, LORD, with loud voice,
15	OEB	Psalms	109	31	for he stands by the poor, at his right hand,
15	OEB	Psalms	110	1	This said the LORD  concerning my lord,
15	OEB	Psalms	110	2	On Zion the LORD  is wielding
15	OEB	Psalms	110	3	The day that you march to battle
15	OEB	Psalms	110	4	The LORD  has sworn and will not repent,
15	OEB	Psalms	110	5	By your side will the LORD  shatter kings
15	OEB	Psalms	110	6	He will execute judgment
15	OEB	Psalms	110	7	He will drink of the brook by the way,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	1	Hallelujah.
15	OEB	Psalms	111	2	Great are the things that the LORD  has done,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	3	Majestic and glorious is his work,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	4	For his marvelous deeds he has won renown;
15	OEB	Psalms	111	5	Food he gives to those who fear him,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	6	His mighty works he has shown to his people,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	7	All that he does is faithful and right,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	8	They are established for ever and ever,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	9	To his people he sent redemption,
15	OEB	Psalms	111	10	The fear of the LORD  is the beginning of wisdom
15	OEB	Psalms	112	1	Hallelujah.Happy are those who fear the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	112	2	Mighty on earth shall be their seed;
15	OEB	Psalms	112	3	Wealth and riches are in their houses,
15	OEB	Psalms	112	4	To the upright arises light in the darkness;
15	OEB	Psalms	112	5	It is well with those who show pity and lend,
15	OEB	Psalms	112	6	For they will never be shaken;
15	OEB	Psalms	112	7	They will not be afraid of evil tidings,
15	OEB	Psalms	112	8	Their heart is firm and unafraid:
15	OEB	Psalms	112	9	With lavish hands they give to the poor,
15	OEB	Psalms	112	10	The sight of them fills the wicked with anger:
15	OEB	Psalms	113	1	Hallelujah.
15	OEB	Psalms	113	2	The name of the LORD  be blessed
15	OEB	Psalms	113	3	From sunrise to sunset
15	OEB	Psalms	113	4	High is the LORD  above all nations,
15	OEB	Psalms	113	5	Who is like the LORD  our God,
15	OEB	Psalms	113	6	He bends down to look
15	OEB	Psalms	113	7	He raises the weak from the dust,
15	OEB	Psalms	113	8	and sets them beside the princes,
15	OEB	Psalms	113	9	He gives the childless woman a home,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	1	When Israel went out of Egypt,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	2	God chose Judah for himself,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	3	The sea saw it, and fled,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	4	Mountains skipped like rams,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	5	Why, sea, do you flee?
15	OEB	Psalms	114	6	Mountains, why skip ram-like?
15	OEB	Psalms	114	7	Earth, tremble before the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	114	8	who turns rocks into pools of water,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	1	Not to us, LORD, not to us,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	2	Why should the heathen say,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	3	Our God he is in heaven;
15	OEB	Psalms	115	4	Their idols are silver and gold,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	5	They have mouths, but cannot speak;
15	OEB	Psalms	115	6	They have ears, but cannot hear;
15	OEB	Psalms	115	7	They have hands, but cannot feel;
15	OEB	Psalms	115	8	Their makers become like them,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	9	O Israel, trust in the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	115	10	House of Aaron, trust in the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	115	11	You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	115	12	The LORD, mindful of us, will bless us:
15	OEB	Psalms	115	13	He will bless those who fear the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	14	May the LORD  add to your numbers
15	OEB	Psalms	115	15	Blessed be you of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	16	The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	17	The dead cannot praise the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	115	18	But we will bless the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	116	1	I love the LORD, for he hears
15	OEB	Psalms	116	2	For he has inclined his ear to me:
15	OEB	Psalms	116	3	About me were snares of death,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	4	Then I called on the name of the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	116	5	Gracious and just is the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	6	The LORD  preserves the simple;
15	OEB	Psalms	116	7	Be at peace, my heart, once more,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	8	You have rescued me from death,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	9	Before the LORD  I will walk
15	OEB	Psalms	116	10	I held fast my faith, though I said,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	11	though in my alarm I said,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	12	What shall I render the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	116	13	I will lift up the cup of salvation,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	14	I will pay my vows to the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	116	15	Grave in the eyes of the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	116	16	Ah, LORD ! I am your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	17	I will offer to you a thank-offering,
15	OEB	Psalms	116	18	I will pay my vows to the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	116	19	in the courts of the house of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	117	1	Praise the LORD, all you nations:
15	OEB	Psalms	117	2	For his mighty love is over us:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	1	Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	2	Let the house of Israel now say:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	3	Let the house of Aaron now say:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	4	Let those who fear the LORD  now say:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	5	Out of straits I called on the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	6	The LORD  is mine; I am fearless.
15	OEB	Psalms	118	7	The LORD  is mine, as my help:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	8	It is better to hide in the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	118	9	It is better to hide in the LORD
15	OEB	Psalms	118	10	Everywhere heathen swarmed round me;
15	OEB	Psalms	118	11	They swarmed, swarmed around me;
15	OEB	Psalms	118	12	they swarmed around me like bees,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	13	Sore they pushed me, to make me fall;
15	OEB	Psalms	118	14	The LORD  is my strength and my song,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	15	Hark! In the tents of the righteous
15	OEB	Psalms	118	16	the hand of the LORD  is exalted,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	17	I shall not die: nay, I shall live,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	18	Though the LORD  has chastened me sore,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	19	“Open to me the gates of victory.
15	OEB	Psalms	118	20	“This is the gate of the LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	118	21	I thank you because you have heard me,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	22	The stone which the builders despised
15	OEB	Psalms	118	23	This has been wrought by the LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	118	24	This day is the LORD ’s own creation:
15	OEB	Psalms	118	25	O LORD, save us, we pray,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	26	Blessed the one who enters
15	OEB	Psalms	118	27	The LORD  is God,
15	OEB	Psalms	118	28	You are my God, I will thank you;
15	OEB	Psalms	118	29	Give thanks to the LORD  for his goodness:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	1	Happy they whose life is blameless,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	2	Happy they who keep his charges,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	3	who have done no wrong,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	4	You yourself have appointed your precepts
15	OEB	Psalms	119	5	O to be steadily guided
15	OEB	Psalms	119	6	Then unashamed shall I be,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	7	I will thank you with heart unfeigned,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	8	I will observe your statutes:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	9	How can a young person keep their life pure?
15	OEB	Psalms	119	10	With all my heart have I sought you,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	11	In my heart have I treasured your word,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	12	Blessed are you, O LORD ;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	13	With my lips have I rehearsed
15	OEB	Psalms	119	14	I delight in the way of your charges,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	15	I will muse upon your precepts,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	16	In your statutes I delight,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	17	Grant that your servant may live,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	18	Open my eyes, that I see
15	OEB	Psalms	119	19	But a guest am I on the earth:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	20	My heart is crushed with longing
15	OEB	Psalms	119	21	You rebuke the proud, the accursed,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	22	Roll away from me scorn and contempt,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	23	Though princes sit plotting against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	24	Your charges are my delight,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	25	I lie grovelling in the dust;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	26	I told of my ways, you made answer;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	27	Grant me insight into your precepts,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	28	I am overcome with sorrow;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	29	Put the way of falsehood from me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	30	I have chosen the way of fidelity,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	31	I hold fast to your charges:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	32	I will run in the way of your commandments,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	33	Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	34	instruct me to keep your law,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	35	Guide me in the path of your commandments,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	36	Incline my heart to your charges,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	37	Turn away my eyes from vain sights,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	38	Confirm to your servant the promise
15	OEB	Psalms	119	39	Remove the reproach which I dread,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	40	Behold, I long for your precepts.
15	OEB	Psalms	119	41	Visit me, LORD, with your love
15	OEB	Psalms	119	42	So shall I answer my slanderers,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	43	Snatch not from my mouth the word of truth,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	44	I will keep your law continually,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	45	So shall I walk in wide spaces,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	46	I will speak of your charge before kings,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	47	Your commandments are my delight,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	48	I will lift up my hands to your commandments,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	49	Remember your word to your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	50	This is my comfort in trouble,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	51	The arrogant utterly scorn me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	52	When I think of your judgments of old,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	53	I am seized with glowing anger
15	OEB	Psalms	119	54	Your statutes have been to me songs
15	OEB	Psalms	119	55	I remember your name in the night,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	56	My lot has been this,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	57	My portion are you, O LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	119	58	I entreat you with all my heart;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	59	I have thought upon my ways,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	60	I hasted and tarried not
15	OEB	Psalms	119	61	Though the godless have wound their cords round me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	62	At midnight I rise to praise you
15	OEB	Psalms	119	63	With all those who fear you I company,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	64	The earth, LORD, is full of your kindness;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	65	Well have you dealt with your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	66	Teach me discretion and knowledge,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	67	Till trouble came I was a wanderer,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	68	You are good and do good;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	69	The proud have forged lies against me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	70	Their heart is gross like fat,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	71	It was good for me to be humbled,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	72	The law of your mouth is better to me
15	OEB	Psalms	119	73	Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	74	Those who fear you shall see me with joy,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	75	I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	76	Let your love be a comfort to me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	77	Visit me with your quickening pity,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	78	Put the proud to shame, who have wronged me falsely:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	79	Let those turn to me who fear you,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	80	Let my heart be sound in your statutes,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	81	My long for you to rescue me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	82	My eyes pine away for your promise:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	83	Though shrivelled like wine-skin in smoke,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	84	How few are the days of your servant!
15	OEB	Psalms	119	85	Proud people have dug for me pits
15	OEB	Psalms	119	86	All your commandments are trusty.
15	OEB	Psalms	119	87	They had nearly made an end of me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	88	Spare me in your kindness,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	89	Forever, O LORD, is your word
15	OEB	Psalms	119	90	Your truth endures age after age;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	91	By your appointment they stand this day,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	92	Had not your law been my joy,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	93	I will never forget your precepts,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	94	I am yours, O save me,

15	OEB	Psalms	119	96	I have seen a limit to all things:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	97	O how I love your law!
15	OEB	Psalms	119	98	Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	99	I am prudent above all my teachers,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	100	I have insight more than the aged,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	101	I refrain my foot from all wicked ways,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	102	I turn not aside from your judgments,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	103	How sweet are your words to my taste,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	104	Insight I win through your precepts,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	105	Your word is a lamp to my feet,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	106	I have sworn an oath, and will keep it,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	107	I am afflicted sorely:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	108	Accept, LORD, my willing praise,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	109	My life is in ceaseless peril;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	110	The wicked set traps for me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	111	In your charges are my everlasting inheritance,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	112	I am resolved to perform your statutes
15	OEB	Psalms	119	113	I hate people of divided heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	114	You are my shelter and shield:

15	OEB	Psalms	119	117	Hold me up, and I shall be saved:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	118	All who swerve from your statutes you spurn:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	119	All the wicked of earth you count as dross,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	120	My flesh, for fear of you, shudders,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	121	Justice and right have I practised,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	122	Be your servant’s surety for good,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	123	My eyes pine for your salvation,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	124	Deal in your love with your servant,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	125	Your servant am I; instruct me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	126	It is time for the LORD  to act:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	127	Therefore I love your commandments
15	OEB	Psalms	119	128	So by all your precepts I guide me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	129	Your decrees are wonderful,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	130	When your word is unfolded, light breaks;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	131	With open mouth I pant
15	OEB	Psalms	119	132	Turn to me with your favor,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	133	Steady my steps by your word,

15	OEB	Psalms	119	137	Righteous are you, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	138	The laws you has ordered are just,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	139	My jealousy has undone me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	140	Your word has been tested well;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	141	I am little and held in contempt,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	142	Just is your justice forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	143	Stress and strain are upon me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	144	Right are your charges forever,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	145	With my whole heart I cry; O answer me.
15	OEB	Psalms	119	146	I cry to you: O save me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	147	Ere the dawn I cry for your help:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	148	Awake I meet the night-watches,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	149	Hear my voice in your kindness:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	150	Near me are wicked tormentors,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	151	but near, too, are you, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	152	Long have I known from your charges
15	OEB	Psalms	119	153	Look on my misery, and rescue me;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	154	Defend my cause and redeem me:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	155	Salvation is far from the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	156	Great is your pity, O LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	119	157	My foes and tormentors are many,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	158	I behold the traitors with loathing,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	159	Behold how I love your precepts:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	160	The sum of your word is truth,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	161	Princes have harassed me wantonly:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	162	Over your word I rejoice
15	OEB	Psalms	119	163	Falsehood I hate and abhor,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	164	Seven times a day do I praise you
15	OEB	Psalms	119	165	Right well do they fare who love your law:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	166	I hope for your salvation;
15	OEB	Psalms	119	167	I observe your charges:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	168	I observe your precepts and charges:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	169	Let my cry come before you, O LORD :
15	OEB	Psalms	119	170	Let my prayer enter into your presence:
15	OEB	Psalms	119	171	My lips shall be fountains of praise,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	172	My tongue shall sing of your word,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	173	Let your hand be ready to help me,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	174	I long, LORD, for your salvation,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	175	Revive me that I may praise you,
15	OEB	Psalms	119	176	I have strayed like a wandering sheep
15	OEB	Psalms	120	1	In distress I cried to the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	120	2	“Deliver me, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	120	3	What shall he give to you,

15	OEB	Psalms	132	2	the oath that he swore to the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	132	3	never to enter his tent,
15	OEB	Psalms	132	4	never to give his eyes sleep
15	OEB	Psalms	132	5	till he had found a place for the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	132	6	We heard of it in Ephrathah,
15	OEB	Psalms	132	7	We went to the place where he dwelt,

15	OEB	Psalms	136	18	And slew noble kings:
15	OEB	Psalms	136	19	Sihon, king of the Amorites:
15	OEB	Psalms	136	20	And Og, king of Bashan:
15	OEB	Psalms	136	21	Who gave their land for possession:

15	OEB	Psalms	137	2	There on the poplars we hung our harps.
15	OEB	Psalms	137	3	For there our captors called for a song:
15	OEB	Psalms	137	4	How can we sing the LORD ’s song
15	OEB	Psalms	137	5	If I forget you, Jerusalem,
15	OEB	Psalms	137	6	May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
15	OEB	Psalms	137	7	Remember the Edomites, LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	137	8	Babylon, despoiler,
15	OEB	Psalms	137	9	Happy are they who seize and dash
15	OEB	Psalms	138	1	I will thank you, O LORD, with all my heart:
15	OEB	Psalms	138	2	and prostrate before your holy temple,
15	OEB	Psalms	138	3	When I called you, you answered;
15	OEB	Psalms	138	4	All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	138	5	and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
15	OEB	Psalms	138	6	For, high though the LORD  is, he looks on the lowly,
15	OEB	Psalms	138	7	Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
15	OEB	Psalms	138	8	The LORD  will accomplish all that which concerns me.
15	OEB	Psalms	139	1	O LORD, you search and know me;
15	OEB	Psalms	139	2	when I sit, when I rise you know it,
15	OEB	Psalms	139	3	When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
15	OEB	Psalms	139	4	There is not a word on my tongue,
15	OEB	Psalms	139	5	Behind and before you beset me,
15	OEB	Psalms	139	6	It’s too wonderful for me to know
15	OEB	Psalms	139	7	Whither shall I go from your spirit?
15	OEB	Psalms	139	8	If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
15	OEB	Psalms	139	9	If I lift up the wings of the morning

15	OEB	Psalms	139	16	Your eyes saw all my days:
15	OEB	Psalms	139	17	But how far, O God, beyond measure
15	OEB	Psalms	139	18	Should I count, they are more than the sand.
15	OEB	Psalms	139	19	Will you slay the wicked, O God?
15	OEB	Psalms	139	20	who maliciously defy you
15	OEB	Psalms	139	21	Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD ?
15	OEB	Psalms	139	22	With perfect hatred I hate them,
15	OEB	Psalms	139	23	Search me, O God, know my heart:
15	OEB	Psalms	139	24	and see if guile be in me;
15	OEB	Psalms	140	1	Rescue me, LORD, from evil people;
15	OEB	Psalms	140	2	from those who plot evil in their heart,
15	OEB	Psalms	140	3	who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent’s,
15	OEB	Psalms	140	4	Preserve me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked,
15	OEB	Psalms	140	5	The proud have hidden a trap for me,
15	OEB	Psalms	140	6	I have said to the LORD, “My God are you;

15	WEB	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark sayings of old,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	6	that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	7	that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	8	and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	10	They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	11	They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	12	He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	13	He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	14	In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	15	He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	18	They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	19	Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
15	WEB	Psalms	78	20	Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?
15	WEB	Psalms	78	21	Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	22	because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	23	Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	24	He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	25	Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	26	He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power he guided the south wind.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	27	He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	28	He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	29	So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	30	They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet in their mouths,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	31	when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	32	For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	33	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	34	When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	38	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!
15	WEB	Psalms	78	41	They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	42	They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	44	he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	48	He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	49	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	50	He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	51	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	52	But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	53	He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	54	He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	55	He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	57	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	61	and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	62	He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	66	He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to a perpetual reproach.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	67	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,
15	WEB	Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	69	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	70	He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
15	WEB	Psalms	78	71	from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.
15	WEB	Psalms	78	72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	1	<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	2	They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	3	Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	5	How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy burn like fire?
15	WEB	Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;
15	WEB	Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	8	Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	9	Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say, Where is their God?  Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	12	Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
15	WEB	Psalms	79	13	So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of The Lilies of the Covenant.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!
15	WEB	Psalms	80	3	Turn us again, God.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	4	Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
15	WEB	Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	6	You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	7	Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	8	You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations, and planted it.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	9	You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root, and filled the land.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were like God's cedars.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	11	It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	12	Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
15	WEB	Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals of the field feed on it.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	14	Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
15	WEB	Psalms	80	15	the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	16	It's burned with fire.  It's cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	17	Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	18	So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call on your name.
15	WEB	Psalms	80	19	Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength!  Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!
15	WEB	Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	3	Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	4	For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	5	He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	6	I removed his shoulder from the burden.  His hands were freed from the basket.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	7	You called in trouble, and I delivered you.  I answered you in the secret place of thunder.  I tested you at the waters of Meribah.  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	8	Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me!
15	WEB	Psalms	81	9	There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	10	I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	11	But my people didn't listen to my voice.  Israel desired none of me.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	12	So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	13	Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
15	WEB	Psalms	81	14	I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	15	The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.
15	WEB	Psalms	81	16	But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	1	<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	2	How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	3	Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	5	They don't know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness.  All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	6	I said, You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	7	Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.
15	WEB	Psalms	82	8	Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	1	<<A song.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent. Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	2	For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.  Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	3	They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	4	Come, they say, and let's destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	5	For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
15	WEB	Psalms	83	7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
15	WEB	Psalms	83	8	Assyria also is joined with them.  They have helped the children of Lot.  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	9	Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
15	WEB	Psalms	83	10	who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
15	WEB	Psalms	83	12	who said, Let us take possession of God's pasturelands.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	13	My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	14	As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
15	WEB	Psalms	83	15	so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	16	Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh.
15	WEB	Psalms	83	17	Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.  Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
15	WEB	Psalms	83	18	that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies!

15	WEB	Psalms	84	4	Blessed are those who dwell in your house.  They are always praising you.  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	5	Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	6	Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs.  Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	7	They go from strength to strength.  Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	8	Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.  Listen, God of Jacob.  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	9	Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	10	For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	11	For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.  Yahweh will give grace and glory.  He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
15	WEB	Psalms	84	12	Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
15	WEB	Psalms	85	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land.  You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.

15	WEB	Psalms	88	3	For my soul is full of troubles.  My life draws near to Sheol.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	4	I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help,
15	WEB	Psalms	88	5	set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more.  They are cut off from your hand.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	6	You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	7	Your wrath lies heavily on me.  You have afflicted me with all your waves.  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	8	You have taken my friends from me.  You have made me an abomination to them.  I am confined, and I can't escape.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	9	My eyes are dim from grief.  I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	10	Do you show wonders to the dead?  Do the dead rise up and praise you?  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	11	Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
15	WEB	Psalms	88	12	Are your wonders made known in the dark?  Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
15	WEB	Psalms	88	13	But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.  In the morning, my prayer comes before you.
15	WEB	Psalms	88	14	Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?  Why do you hide your face from me?
15	WEB	Psalms	88	15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.

15	WEB	Psalms	89	4	'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne to all generations.'  Selah.
15	WEB	Psalms	89	5	The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

15	WEB	Psalms	106	6	We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	7	Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power known.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.

15	WEB	Psalms	106	15	He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

15	WEB	Psalms	106	22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	24	Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,
15	WEB	Psalms	106	25	but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	26	Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,

15	WEB	Psalms	106	28	They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	31	That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	32	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;
15	WEB	Psalms	106	33	because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	34	They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
15	WEB	Psalms	106	35	but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	36	They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	37	Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	38	They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	39	Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	40	Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	41	He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated them ruled over them.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	42	Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into subjection under their hand.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	43	Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	45	He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
15	WEB	Psalms	106	46	He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.

15	WEB	Psalms	106	48	Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting!  Let all the people say, Amen. Praise Yah!
15	WEB	Psalms	107	1	Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	2	Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
15	WEB	Psalms	107	3	And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	6	Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,
15	WEB	Psalms	107	7	he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	8	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!
15	WEB	Psalms	107	9	For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry soul with good.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,
15	WEB	Psalms	107	11	because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds in sunder.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	15	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!
15	WEB	Psalms	107	16	For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	17	Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	18	Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to the gates of death.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	19	Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, he saves them out of their distresses.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	20	He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	21	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!
15	WEB	Psalms	107	22	Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	23	Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;
15	WEB	Psalms	107	24	These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	25	For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	26	They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	27	They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	28	Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	29	He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	30	Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their desired haven.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	31	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works for the children of men!
15	WEB	Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	33	He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
15	WEB	Psalms	107	34	and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	35	He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	36	There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,
15	WEB	Psalms	107	37	sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	38	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	39	Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	40	He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	41	Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	42	The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will shut their mouths.
15	WEB	Psalms	107	43	Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

15	WEB	Psalms	109	17	Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.  He didn't delight in blessing, and it was far from him.

16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	12	For whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law: and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	13	For not the hearers of the law are just before God: but the doers of the law shall be justified.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these, having not the law, are a law to themselves.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	15	Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them: and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	17	But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of God,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	18	And knowest his will and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	19	Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	21	Thou therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou, that preachest that men should not steal, stealest.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	22	Thou, that sayest men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou, that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	23	Thou, that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	24	(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	25	Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	26	If then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	27	And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	28	For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly: nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew that is one inwardly and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter: whose praise is not of men, but of God. Romans Chapter 3 The advantages of the Jews. All men are sinners and none can be justified by the works of the law, but only by the grace of Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	1	What advantage then hath the Jew: or what is the profit of circumcision?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	2	Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	3	For what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	4	But God is true and every man a liar, as it is written: That thou mayest be justified in thy words and mayest overcome when thou art judged. God only is essentially true. All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errors: nevertheless God, who is the truth, will make good his promise of keeping his church in all truth. See St. John 16.13.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	5	But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	6	(I speak according to man.) God forbid! Otherwise how shall God judge this world?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	8	And not rather (as we are slandered and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that there may come good? Whose damnation is just.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	9	What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	10	As it is written: There is not any man just. There is not any man just, viz.... by virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and grace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth: there is none that seeketh after God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	12	All have turned out of the way: they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	15	Their feet swift to shed blood:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery in their ways:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	17	And the way of peace they have not known.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law: that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	21	But now, without the law, the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	22	Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	23	For all have sinned and do need the glory of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	25	Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	26	Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time: that he himself may be just and the justifier of him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	27	Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	28	For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law. By faith, etc.... The faith, to which the apostle here attributes man’s justification, is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified; but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised. Heb. 11. A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ. Gal. 5.6. In short, a faith which takes in hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments. And the works which he here excludes, are only the works of the law: that is, such as are done by the law of nature, or that of Moses, antecedent to the faith of Christ: but by no means, such as follow faith, and proceed from it.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	30	For it is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	31	Do we then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid! But we establish the law. Romans Chapter 4 Abraham was not justified by works done, as of himself, but by grace and by faith. And that before he was circumcised. Gentiles, by faith, are his children.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. By works.... Done by his own strength, without the grace of God, and faith in him. Not before God.... Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God: and it was reputed to him unto justice. Reputed, etc.... By God, who reputeth nothing otherwise than it is. However, we may gather from this word, that when we are justified, our justification proceedeth from God’s free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature, abstracting from God’s grace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace but according to debt. To him that worketh.... Vis., as of his own fund, or by his own strength. Such a man, says the apostle, challenges his reward as a debt due to his own performances; whereas he who worketh not, that is, who presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength, but seeketh justice through faith and grace, is freely justified by God’s grace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	6	As David also termeth the blessedness of a man to whom God reputeth justice without works:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven: and whose sins are covered. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.... That is, blessed are those who, by doing penance, have obtained pardon and remission of their sins, and also are covered; that is, newly clothed with the habit of grace, and vested with the stole of charity.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.... That is, blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence, that no grievous sin can be imputed to him. And, likewise, blessed is the man, who after fall into sin, hath done penance and leads a virtuous life, by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent a relapse, that sin is no more imputed to him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	9	This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice. In the circumcision, etc.... That is, is it only for the Jews that are circumcised? No, says the apostle, but also for the uncircumcised Gentiles: who, by faith and grace, may come to justice; as Abraham did before he was circumcised.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	10	How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which he had, being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised: that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	12	And he might be the father of circumcision; not to them only that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faith that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world: but through the justice of faith.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	14	For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void: the promise is made of no effect. Be heirs.... That is, if they alone, who follow the ceremonies of the law, be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham; then that faith which was so much praised in him, will be found to be of little value. And the very promise will be made void, by which he was promised to be the father, not of the Jews only, but of all nations of believers.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	15	For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression. The law worketh wrath.... The law, abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God’s wrath.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	16	Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	17	(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations), before God, whom he believed: who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	19	And he was not weak in faith. Neither did he consider his own body, now dead (whereas he was almost an hundred years old), nor the dead womb of Sara.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	20	In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust: but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	21	Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	22	And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	23	Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	24	But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	25	Who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification. Romans Chapter 5 The grounds we have for hope in Christ. Sin and death came by Adam, grace and life by Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	1	Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand: and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	3	And not only so: but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	4	And patience trial; and trial hope;
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	5	And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	6	For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	7	For scarce for a just man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his charity towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	9	Christ died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	11	And not only so: but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	12	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world and by sin death: and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned. By one man.... Adam, from whom we all contracted original sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	13	For until the law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the law was not. Not imputed.... That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	14	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned, after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	15	But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but grace is of many offences unto justification.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift and of justice shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	18	Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	19	For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	20	Now the law entered in that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound. That sin might abound.... Not as if the law were given on purpose for sin to abound: but that it so happened through man’s perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned to death: so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans Chapter 6 The Christian must die to sin and live to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	1	What shall we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	2	God forbid! For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	3	Know you not that all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	4	For we are buried together with him by baptism into death: that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer. Old man—body of sin.... Our corrupt state, subject to sin and concupiscence, coming to us from Adam, is called our old man, as our state, reformed in and by Christ, is called the new man. And the vices and sins, which then ruled in us are named the body of sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is justified from sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	8	Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no more. Death shall no more have dominion over him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	10	For in that he died to sin, he died once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	11	So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin: but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of justice unto God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	15	What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid!
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	16	Know you not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death or of obedience unto justice.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin but have obeyed from the heart unto that form of doctrine into which you have been delivered.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	18	Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	19	I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity: so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	20	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	21	What fruit therefore had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 7 We are released by Christ from the law and from the guilt of sin, though the inclination to it still tempts us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	1	Know you not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth? As long as it liveth; ... or, as long as he liveth.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	2	For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	3	Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ: that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead that we may bring forth fruit to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	6	But now we are loosed from the law of death wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid! But I do not know sin, but by the law. For I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. Sin taking occasion.... Sin, or concupiscence, which is called sin, because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was weakened by the prohibition: the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly giving occasion to it: but occasion being taken by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	9	And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	10	And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me: and by it killed me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law indeed is holy: and the commandment holy and just and good.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	13	Was that then which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me: that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure. That it may appear sin, or that sin may appear, viz.... To be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good, to work death.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual. But I am carnal, sold under sin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	15	For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will: but the evil which I hate, that I do. I do not that good which I will, etc.... The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason: and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors: and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind. But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	18	For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will is present with me: but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	19	For the good which I will, I do not: but the evil which I will not, that I do.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	20	Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it: but sin that dwelleth in me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	21	I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	22	For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind and captivating me in the law of sin that is in my members.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	24	Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	25	The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God: but with the flesh, the law of sin. Romans Chapter 8 There is no condemnation to them that, being justified by Christ, walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. Their strong hope and love of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	1	There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	2	For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	4	That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	5	For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are of the flesh: but they that are according to the spirit mind the things that are of the spirit.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	6	For the wisdom of the flesh is death: but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	7	Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God. For it is not subject to the law of God: neither can it be.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	8	And they who are in the flesh cannot please God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin: but the spirit liveth, because of justification.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ, from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	14	For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	15	For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear: but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	16	For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God. The Spirit himself, etc.... By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God’s favour; by which they are much strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance: which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Phil. 2.12. And that he that thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall. 1 Cor. 10.12. See also, Rom. 11.20, 21, 22.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	17	And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	19	For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God. The expectation of the creature, etc.... He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity: not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	21	Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	22	For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	23	And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit: even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	26	Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For, we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, Asketh for us.... The Spirit is said to ask, and desire for the saints, and to pray in us; inasmuch as he inspireth prayer, and teacheth us to pray.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what the Spirit desireth: because he asketh for the saints according to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	28	And we know that to them that love God all things work together unto good: to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son: that he might be the Firstborn amongst many brethren. He also predestinated, etc.... That is, God hath preordained that all his elect should be conformable to the image of his Son. We must not here offer to pry into the secrets of God’s eternal election; only firmly believe that all our good, in time and eternity, flows originally from God’s free goodness; and all our evil from man’s free will.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	30	And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	32	He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	33	Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God is he that justifieth:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	34	Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died: yea that is risen also again, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	35	Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or danger? Or persecution? Or the sword?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	36	(As it is written: For thy sake, we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	38	For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might, I am sure.... That is, I am persuaded; as it is in the Greek, pepeismai.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans Chapter 9 The apostle’s concern for the Jews. God’s election is free and not confined to their nation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	1	I speak the truth in Christ: I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	2	That I have great sadness and continual sorrow in my heart.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	3	For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren: who are my kinsmen according to the flesh: Anathema; ... A curse. The apostle’s concern and love for his countrymen the Jews was so great, that he was willing to suffer even an anathema, or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites: to whom belongeth the adoption as of children and the glory and the testament and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel. All are not Israelites, etc.... Not all, who are the carnal seed of Israel, are true Israelites in God’s account: who, as by his free grace, he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election and mercy, raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	7	Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children: but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	8	That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are the children of God: but they that are the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come. And Sara shall have a son.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	10	And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once of Isaac our father.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	11	For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God according to election might stand): Not yet born, etc.... By this example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in his election, mercy and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined; nor to any prerogative of birth, or any forgoing merits. For as, antecedently to his grace, he sees no merits in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath: there is no one whom he might not justly leave in that mass; so that whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy: and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice. As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution of the other.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	12	Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	13	As it is written: Jacob I have loved: but Esau I have hated.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid!
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. And I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Not of him that willeth, etc.... That is, by any power or strength of his own, abstracting from the grace of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. To this purpose, etc.... Not that God made him on purpose that he should sin, and so be damned; but foreseeing his obstinacy in sin, and the abuse of his own free will, he raised him up to be a mighty king, to make a more remarkable example of him: and that his power might be better known, and his justice in punishing him, published throughout the earth.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	18	Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will. And whom he will, he hardeneth. He hardeneth.... Not by being the cause or author of his sin, but by withholding his grace, and so leaving him in his sin, in punishment of his past demerits.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? For who resisteth his will?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	20	O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	21	Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour? The potter.... This similitude is used only to shew that we are not to dispute with our Maker, nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another; for since the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy, that he makes out of it so many vessels of honor; and it is no more than just, that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels of dishonor.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	23	That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared unto glory?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	24	Even us, whom also he hath called, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	25	As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy; one that hath obtained mercy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	26	And it shalt be in the place where it was said unto them: you are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	27	And Isaias cried out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved. A remnant.... That is, a small number only of the children of Israel shall be converted and saved. How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions, when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel!
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	28	For he shall finish his word and cut it short in justice: because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	29	And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabbaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom and we had been like unto Gomorrha.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who followed not after justice have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	31	But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	32	Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	33	As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and a rock of scandal. And whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded. Romans Chapter 10 The end of the law is faith in Christ, which the Jews refusing to submit to, cannot be justified.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	1	Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed and my prayer to God is for them unto salvation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	3	For they, not knowing the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God. The justice of God.... That is, the justice which God giveth us through Christ; as on the other hand, the Jews’ own justice is, that which they pretended to by their own strength, or by the observance of the law, without faith in Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	4	For the end of the law is Christ: unto justice to everyone that believeth.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	5	For Moses wrote that the justice which is of the law: The man that shall do it shall live by it.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	6	But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart: Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down;
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	7	Or who shall descend into the deep? That is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	8	But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee; even in thy mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	9	For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Thou shalt be saved.... To confess the Lord Jesus, and to call upon the name of the Lord (ver. 13) is not barely the professing a belief in the person of Christ; but moreover, implies a belief of his whole doctrine, and an obedience to his law; without which, the calling him Lord will save no man. St. Matt. 7.21.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	10	For, with the heart, we believe unto justice: but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things? Unless they be sent.... Here is an evident proof against all new teachers, who have all usurped to themselves the ministry without any lawful mission, derived by succession from the apostles, to whom Christ said, John 20.21, As my Father hath sent me, I also send you.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	16	But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	17	Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	18	But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily: Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the whole world.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	19	But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation: by a foolish nation I will anger you.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	20	But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me. I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not and contradicteth me. Romans Chapter 11 God hath not cast off all Israel. The Gentiles must not be proud but stand in faith and fear.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	1	I say then: Hath God cast away his people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias, how he calleth on God against Israel?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	3	Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars. And I am left alone: and they seek my life.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	4	But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand men that have not bowed their knees to Baal. Seven thousand, etc.... This is very ill alleged by some, against the perpetual visibility of the church of Christ; the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of Jezabel in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Judah.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	5	Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	6	And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace. It is not now by works, etc.... If salvation were to come by works, done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such dead works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation. It is not the same with regard to works done with, and by, God’s grace; for to such works as these, he has promised eternal salvation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	7	What then? That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it. And the rest have been blinded.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	8	As it is written: God hath given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, until this present day. God hath given them, etc.... Not by his working or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their obstinacy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	9	And David saith: Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	11	I say then: Have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid! But by their offence salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them. That they should fall.... The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only, (many thousands of them having been at first converted,) and for a time; which fall of theirs, God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	12	Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the diminution of them the riches of the Gentiles: how much more the fulness of them?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	13	For I say to you, Gentiles: As long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	14	If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh and may save some of them.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	15	For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root: but the root thee.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	20	Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear. Thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.... We see here that he who standeth by faith may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	21	For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps also he spare not thee.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.... The Gentiles are here admonished not to be proud, nor to glory against the Jews: but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they be cast off. Not that the whole church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, wert grafted into the good olive tree: how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	25	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery (lest you should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	26	And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	27	And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance. For the gifts and the calling of God are without.... his repenting himself of them; for the promises of God are unchangeable, nor can he repent of conferring his gifts.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	30	For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	31	So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all. Concluded all in unbelief.... He hath found all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, in unbelief and sin; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own free will; so that their calling and election is purely owing to his mercy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	36	For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen. Romans Chapter 12 Lessons of Christian virtues.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world: but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	3	For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	4	For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ; and every one members one of another:

16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	21	Be not overcome by evil: but overcome evil by good. Romans Chapter 13 Lessons of obedience to superiors and mutual charity.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	1	Let every soul be subject to higher powers. For there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	2	Therefore, he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	3	For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	4	For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.

16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	9	For: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	10	The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	11	And that, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	12	The night is passed And the day is at hand. Let us, therefore cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ: and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences. Romans Chapter 14 The strong must bear with the weak. Cautions against judging and giving scandal.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	1	Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. Eat all things.... Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine’s flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	4	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	5	For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day. Let every man abound in his own sense. Between day, etc.... Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the law.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	6	He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	10	But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	11	For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	12	Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother’s way.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	14	I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	15	For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	16	Let not then our good be evil spoken of.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	18	For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved of men.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	19	Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	20	Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	22	Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	23	But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin. Discerneth.... That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his conscience, what he deems unclean. Of faith.... By faith is here understood judgment and conscience: to act against which is always a sin. Romans Chapter 15 He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	1	Now, we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	2	Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	3	For Christ did not please himself: but, as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	4	For what things soever were written were written for our learning: that, through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind, one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	6	That with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	7	Wherefore, receive one another, as Christ also hath received you, unto the honour of God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: Minister of the circumcision.... That is, executed his office and ministry towards the Jews, the people of the circumcision.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	9	But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles and will sing to thy name.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	10	And again he saith: rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	11	And again: praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles: and magnify him, all ye people.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	12	And again, Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing: that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Ghost.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	14	And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	15	But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given me from God,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles: sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	17	I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	18	For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	19	By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about, as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	20	And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	21	But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	22	For which cause also, I was hindered very much from coming to you and have been kept away till now.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	23	But now, having no more place in these countries and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	24	When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that, as I pass, I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you: if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	25	But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	27	For it hath pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	28	When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	29	And I know that when I come to you I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
16	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	30	I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,

16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	4	And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	10	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	21	Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	30	Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	31	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	32	Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	13	(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	18	And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	8	And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	9	What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	26	To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	30	Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	7	Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	17	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	3	And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	11	And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	13	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	19	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	2	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	3	So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	10	And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	23	And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	36	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	10	And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	11	(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	24	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	26	And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	28	For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	32	Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	3	For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	27	For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father’s sakes.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	7	Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	10	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	11	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	13	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	3	For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.

16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	19	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	21	But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	27	It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	2	That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	6	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	9	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	10	Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus’ household.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	11	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	21	Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	22	I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	23	Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	26	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:
16	KJV	The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	27	To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
16	OEB	Romans	1	1	From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.
16	OEB	Romans	1	2	This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,
16	OEB	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,
16	OEB	Romans	1	4	but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.
16	OEB	Romans	1	5	Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.
16	OEB	Romans	1	6	And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
16	OEB	Romans	1	7	To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
16	OEB	Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.
16	OEB	Romans	1	9	God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,
16	OEB	Romans	1	10	asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.
16	OEB	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –
16	OEB	Romans	1	12	or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.
16	OEB	Romans	1	13	I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.
16	OEB	Romans	1	14	I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.
16	OEB	Romans	1	15	And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.
16	OEB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.
16	OEB	Romans	1	17	For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’
16	OEB	Romans	1	18	So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.
16	OEB	Romans	1	19	This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.
16	OEB	Romans	1	20	For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;
16	OEB	Romans	1	21	because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.
16	OEB	Romans	1	22	Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;
16	OEB	Romans	1	23	and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.
16	OEB	Romans	1	24	Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;
16	OEB	Romans	1	25	for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.
16	OEB	Romans	1	26	That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;
16	OEB	Romans	1	27	while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.
16	OEB	Romans	1	28	Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.
16	OEB	Romans	1	29	They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.
16	OEB	Romans	1	30	They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.
16	OEB	Romans	1	31	They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.
16	OEB	Romans	1	32	Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.
16	OEB	Romans	2	1	Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.
16	OEB	Romans	2	2	And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.
16	OEB	Romans	2	3	You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?
16	OEB	Romans	2	4	Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
16	OEB	Romans	2	5	Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;
16	OEB	Romans	2	6	for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.
16	OEB	Romans	2	7	To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;
16	OEB	Romans	2	8	while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,
16	OEB	Romans	2	9	will fall on every human being who persists in wrongdoing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.
16	OEB	Romans	2	10	But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,
16	OEB	Romans	2	11	since God shows no partiality.
16	OEB	Romans	2	12	All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.
16	OEB	Romans	2	13	It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.
16	OEB	Romans	2	14	When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;
16	OEB	Romans	2	15	for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense –
16	OEB	Romans	2	16	on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.
16	OEB	Romans	2	17	But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,
16	OEB	Romans	2	18	and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.
16	OEB	Romans	2	19	Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,
16	OEB	Romans	2	20	and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.
16	OEB	Romans	2	21	Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?
16	OEB	Romans	2	22	Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?
16	OEB	Romans	2	23	Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?
16	OEB	Romans	2	24	For, as scripture says – ‘The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you’!
16	OEB	Romans	2	25	Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.
16	OEB	Romans	2	26	If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?
16	OEB	Romans	2	27	Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.
16	OEB	Romans	2	28	For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;
16	OEB	Romans	2	29	and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.
16	OEB	Romans	3	1	What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?
16	OEB	Romans	3	2	Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.
16	OEB	Romans	3	3	What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!
16	OEB	Romans	3	4	God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’
16	OEB	Romans	3	5	But what if our wrongdoing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!
16	OEB	Romans	3	6	Otherwise how can God judge the world?
16	OEB	Romans	3	7	But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?
16	OEB	Romans	3	8	Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!
16	OEB	Romans	3	9	What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.
16	OEB	Romans	3	10	As scripture says –
16	OEB	Romans	3	11	not one who understands,
16	OEB	Romans	3	12	They have all gone astray;
16	OEB	Romans	3	13	‘Their throats are like opened graves;
16	OEB	Romans	3	14	‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’
16	OEB	Romans	3	15	‘Swift are their feet to shed blood.
16	OEB	Romans	3	16	Distress and trouble dog their steps,
16	OEB	Romans	3	17	and the path of peace they do not know.’
16	OEB	Romans	3	18	‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’
16	OEB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.
16	OEB	Romans	3	20	For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.
16	OEB	Romans	3	21	But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –
16	OEB	Romans	3	22	the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.
16	OEB	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,
16	OEB	Romans	3	24	but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.
16	OEB	Romans	3	25	For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;
16	OEB	Romans	3	26	as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.
16	OEB	Romans	3	27	What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.
16	OEB	Romans	3	28	For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.
16	OEB	Romans	3	29	Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?
16	OEB	Romans	3	30	Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.
16	OEB	Romans	3	31	Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law.
16	OEB	Romans	4	1	What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?
16	OEB	Romans	4	2	If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.
16	OEB	Romans	4	3	For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’
16	OEB	Romans	4	4	Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;
16	OEB	Romans	4	5	while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	4	6	In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –
16	OEB	Romans	4	7	‘Blessed are those whose wrongdoings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!
16	OEB	Romans	4	8	Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’
16	OEB	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’
16	OEB	Romans	4	10	Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?
16	OEB	Romans	4	11	Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;
16	OEB	Romans	4	12	as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.
16	OEB	Romans	4	13	For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.
16	OEB	Romans	4	14	If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!
16	OEB	Romans	4	15	Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.
16	OEB	Romans	4	16	That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all;
16	OEB	Romans	4	17	as scripture says – ‘I have made you the father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.
16	OEB	Romans	4	18	With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words – ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the father of many nations.’
16	OEB	Romans	4	19	Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.
16	OEB	Romans	4	20	He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.
16	OEB	Romans	4	21	On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.
16	OEB	Romans	4	22	And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’
16	OEB	Romans	4	23	Now these words – ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ – were not written with reference to Abraham only;
16	OEB	Romans	4	24	but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;
16	OEB	Romans	4	25	for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offenses, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.
16	OEB	Romans	5	1	Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	5	2	It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.
16	OEB	Romans	5	3	And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;
16	OEB	Romans	5	4	for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,
16	OEB	Romans	5	5	and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;
16	OEB	Romans	5	6	seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.
16	OEB	Romans	5	7	Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.
16	OEB	Romans	5	8	But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.
16	OEB	Romans	5	9	Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.
16	OEB	Romans	5	10	For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.
16	OEB	Romans	5	11	And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.
16	OEB	Romans	5	12	Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.
16	OEB	Romans	5	13	Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.
16	OEB	Romans	5	14	Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the one to come.
16	OEB	Romans	5	15	But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.
16	OEB	Romans	5	16	There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	5	17	For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.
16	OEB	Romans	5	18	Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.
16	OEB	Romans	5	19	For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.
16	OEB	Romans	5	20	Law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,
16	OEB	Romans	5	21	in order that, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	6	1	What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?
16	OEB	Romans	6	2	Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, so how can we go on living in it?
16	OEB	Romans	6	3	Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?
16	OEB	Romans	6	4	Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.
16	OEB	Romans	6	5	If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.
16	OEB	Romans	6	6	We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
16	OEB	Romans	6	7	For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.
16	OEB	Romans	6	8	And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.
16	OEB	Romans	6	9	We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.
16	OEB	Romans	6	10	For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.
16	OEB	Romans	6	11	So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.
16	OEB	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.
16	OEB	Romans	6	13	Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	6	14	For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.
16	OEB	Romans	6	15	What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid!
16	OEB	Romans	6	16	Surely you know that when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service to sin which leads to death, or a service to duty which leads to righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	6	17	God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.
16	OEB	Romans	6	18	Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	6	19	I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.
16	OEB	Romans	6	20	While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	6	21	But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.
16	OEB	Romans	6	22	But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.
16	OEB	Romans	6	23	The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	7	1	Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.
16	OEB	Romans	7	2	For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.
16	OEB	Romans	7	3	If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.
16	OEB	Romans	7	4	And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.
16	OEB	Romans	7	5	When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.
16	OEB	Romans	7	6	But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.
16	OEB	Romans	7	7	What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.
16	OEB	Romans	7	8	But sin took advantage of the commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.
16	OEB	Romans	7	9	There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!
16	OEB	Romans	7	10	The commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!
16	OEB	Romans	7	11	Sin took advantage of the commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.
16	OEB	Romans	7	12	And so the Law is holy, and each commandment is also holy, and just, and good.
16	OEB	Romans	7	13	Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.
16	OEB	Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.
16	OEB	Romans	7	15	I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.
16	OEB	Romans	7	16	But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.
16	OEB	Romans	7	17	This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
16	OEB	Romans	7	18	I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.
16	OEB	Romans	7	19	I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.
16	OEB	Romans	7	20	But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
16	OEB	Romans	7	21	This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!
16	OEB	Romans	7	22	At heart I delight in the Law of God;
16	OEB	Romans	7	23	but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.
16	OEB	Romans	7	24	Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?
16	OEB	Romans	7	25	Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.
16	OEB	Romans	8	1	There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;
16	OEB	Romans	8	2	for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.
16	OEB	Romans	8	3	What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,
16	OEB	Romans	8	4	so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.
16	OEB	Romans	8	5	They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.
16	OEB	Romans	8	6	To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;
16	OEB	Romans	8	7	because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.
16	OEB	Romans	8	8	They who are earthly cannot please God.
16	OEB	Romans	8	9	You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;
16	OEB	Romans	8	10	but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	8	11	And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.
16	OEB	Romans	8	12	So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.
16	OEB	Romans	8	13	If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.
16	OEB	Romans	8	14	All who are guided by the Spirit of God are children of God.
16	OEB	Romans	8	15	For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a child by adoption, which leads us to cry ‘Abba, our Father.’
16	OEB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,
16	OEB	Romans	8	17	and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.
16	OEB	Romans	8	18	I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.
16	OEB	Romans	8	19	All nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.
16	OEB	Romans	8	20	For nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –
16	OEB	Romans	8	21	yet not without the hope that some day nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.
16	OEB	Romans	8	22	We know, indeed, that all nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.
16	OEB	Romans	8	23	And not nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.
16	OEB	Romans	8	24	By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?
16	OEB	Romans	8	25	But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.
16	OEB	Romans	8	26	So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.
16	OEB	Romans	8	27	Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.
16	OEB	Romans	8	28	But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.
16	OEB	Romans	8	29	For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.
16	OEB	Romans	8	30	And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory.
16	OEB	Romans	8	31	What are we to say, then, in the light of all this?
16	OEB	Romans	8	32	God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?
16	OEB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God!
16	OEB	Romans	8	34	Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf!
16	OEB	Romans	8	35	Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
16	OEB	Romans	8	36	Scripture says – ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’
16	OEB	Romans	8	37	Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us!
16	OEB	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,
16	OEB	Romans	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!
16	OEB	Romans	9	1	I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
16	OEB	Romans	9	2	bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.
16	OEB	Romans	9	3	I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.
16	OEB	Romans	9	4	For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as children, the visible presence, the covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the promises.
16	OEB	Romans	9	5	They are descended from the patriarchs, and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.
16	OEB	Romans	9	6	Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;
16	OEB	Romans	9	7	nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	8	This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.
16	OEB	Romans	9	9	For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	10	Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.
16	OEB	Romans	9	11	For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,
16	OEB	Romans	9	12	that the elder would be a servant to the younger.
16	OEB	Romans	9	13	The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	14	What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!
16	OEB	Romans	9	15	For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	16	So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.
16	OEB	Romans	9	17	In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	18	So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.
16	OEB	Romans	9	19	Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?’
16	OEB	Romans	9	20	I might rather ask ‘Who are you who are arguing with God?’ Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it ‘Why did you make me like this?’
16	OEB	Romans	9	21	Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?
16	OEB	Romans	9	22	And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,
16	OEB	Romans	9	23	so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,
16	OEB	Romans	9	24	and whom he called – even us – not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also!
16	OEB	Romans	9	25	This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – ‘Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.
16	OEB	Romans	9	26	And in the place where it was said to them – “You are not my people”, they will be called sons of the living God.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – ‘Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape!
16	OEB	Romans	9	28	For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah foretold – ‘Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.’
16	OEB	Romans	9	30	What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;
16	OEB	Romans	9	31	while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.
16	OEB	Romans	9	32	And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.
16	OEB	Romans	9	33	As scripture says – ‘See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.’
16	OEB	Romans	10	1	My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.
16	OEB	Romans	10	2	I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,
16	OEB	Romans	10	3	for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.
16	OEB	Romans	10	4	For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.
16	OEB	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.
16	OEB	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ (which means to bring Christ down)
16	OEB	Romans	10	7	‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).
16	OEB	Romans	10	8	No, but what does it say? ‘The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart’ (which means ‘The message of faith’ which we proclaim).
16	OEB	Romans	10	9	For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
16	OEB	Romans	10	10	For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their profession of faith and so find salvation.
16	OEB	Romans	10	11	As the passage of scripture says – ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’
16	OEB	Romans	10	12	For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.
16	OEB	Romans	10	13	For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.
16	OEB	Romans	10	14	But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?
16	OEB	Romans	10	15	And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’
16	OEB	Romans	10	16	Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’
16	OEB	Romans	10	17	And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.
16	OEB	Romans	10	18	But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for – ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’
16	OEB	Romans	10	19	But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand?’ First there is Moses, who says – ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’
16	OEB	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah says boldly – ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.’
16	OEB	Romans	10	21	But of the people of Israel he says – ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	1	I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
16	OEB	Romans	11	2	God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?
16	OEB	Romans	11	3	‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	4	But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	5	And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.
16	OEB	Romans	11	6	But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.
16	OEB	Romans	11	7	What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.
16	OEB	Romans	11	8	The rest grew callous; as scripture says – ‘God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	9	David, too, says – ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;
16	OEB	Romans	11	10	may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	11	I ask then – ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.
16	OEB	Romans	11	12	And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!
16	OEB	Romans	11	13	But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.
16	OEB	Romans	11	14	Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.
16	OEB	Romans	11	15	For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?
16	OEB	Romans	11	16	If the first handful of dough is holy, so is the whole mass, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
16	OEB	Romans	11	17	Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.
16	OEB	Romans	11	18	Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.
16	OEB	Romans	11	19	But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.
16	OEB	Romans	11	20	True, it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.
16	OEB	Romans	11	21	For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
16	OEB	Romans	11	22	See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.
16	OEB	Romans	11	23	And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.
16	OEB	Romans	11	24	If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree.
16	OEB	Romans	11	25	My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognize the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.
16	OEB	Romans	11	26	And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.
16	OEB	Romans	11	27	And they will see the fulfillment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.’
16	OEB	Romans	11	28	From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the patriarchs.
16	OEB	Romans	11	29	For God never regrets his gifts or his call.
16	OEB	Romans	11	30	Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;
16	OEB	Romans	11	31	so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.
16	OEB	Romans	11	32	For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.
16	OEB	Romans	11	33	Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –
16	OEB	Romans	11	34	ho has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?
16	OEB	Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?
16	OEB	Romans	11	36	For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.
16	OEB	Romans	12	1	I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.
16	OEB	Romans	12	2	Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.
16	OEB	Romans	12	3	In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of themselves than they ought to think, but to think until they learn to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.
16	OEB	Romans	12	4	For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,
16	OEB	Romans	12	5	so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.
16	OEB	Romans	12	6	Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;
16	OEB	Romans	12	7	if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,
16	OEB	Romans	12	8	the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.
16	OEB	Romans	12	9	Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.
16	OEB	Romans	12	10	In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;
16	OEB	Romans	12	11	never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;
16	OEB	Romans	12	12	rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;
16	OEB	Romans	12	13	relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.
16	OEB	Romans	12	14	Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.
16	OEB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.
16	OEB	Romans	12	16	Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.
16	OEB	Romans	12	17	Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.
16	OEB	Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.
16	OEB	Romans	12	19	Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’
16	OEB	Romans	12	20	Rather – ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’
16	OEB	Romans	12	21	Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
16	OEB	Romans	13	1	Let everyone obey the supreme authorities. For no authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing authorities have been appointed by God.
16	OEB	Romans	13	2	Therefore the one who sets themself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.
16	OEB	Romans	13	3	A good action has nothing to fear from rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.
16	OEB	Romans	13	4	For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.
16	OEB	Romans	13	5	You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.
16	OEB	Romans	13	6	This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.
16	OEB	Romans	13	7	In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due.
16	OEB	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the Law.
16	OEB	Romans	13	9	The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, you must not kill, you must not steal, you must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’
16	OEB	Romans	13	10	Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.
16	OEB	Romans	13	11	This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.
16	OEB	Romans	13	12	The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us be done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.
16	OEB	Romans	13	13	Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.
16	OEB	Romans	13	14	No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.
16	OEB	Romans	14	1	As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.
16	OEB	Romans	14	2	One person’s faith permits them to eat food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.
16	OEB	Romans	14	3	The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.
16	OEB	Romans	14	4	Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.
16	OEB	Romans	14	5	Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.
16	OEB	Romans	14	6	The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.
16	OEB	Romans	14	7	There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;
16	OEB	Romans	14	8	for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.
16	OEB	Romans	14	9	The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.
16	OEB	Romans	14	10	I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.
16	OEB	Romans	14	11	For scripture says – ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.”’
16	OEB	Romans	14	12	So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.
16	OEB	Romans	14	13	Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	14	14	Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.
16	OEB	Romans	14	15	If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!
16	OEB	Romans	14	16	Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.
16	OEB	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.
16	OEB	Romans	14	18	The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.
16	OEB	Romans	14	19	Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.
16	OEB	Romans	14	20	Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.
16	OEB	Romans	14	21	The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	14	22	As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!
16	OEB	Romans	14	23	The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.
16	OEB	Romans	15	1	We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.
16	OEB	Romans	15	2	Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.
16	OEB	Romans	15	3	Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’
16	OEB	Romans	15	4	Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.
16	OEB	Romans	15	5	And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,
16	OEB	Romans	15	6	so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
16	OEB	Romans	15	7	Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.
16	OEB	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,
16	OEB	Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’
16	OEB	Romans	15	10	And again it says – ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’
16	OEB	Romans	15	11	And yet again – ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’
16	OEB	Romans	15	12	Again, Isaiah says – ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’
16	OEB	Romans	15	13	May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
16	OEB	Romans	15	14	I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.
16	OEB	Romans	15	15	But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –
16	OEB	Romans	15	16	because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.
16	OEB	Romans	15	17	It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.
16	OEB	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –
16	OEB	Romans	15	19	by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;
16	OEB	Romans	15	20	yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.
16	OEB	Romans	15	21	But as scripture says – ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’
16	OEB	Romans	15	22	That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.
16	OEB	Romans	15	23	But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.
16	OEB	Romans	15	24	For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.
16	OEB	Romans	15	25	Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.
16	OEB	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.
16	OEB	Romans	15	27	Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.
16	OEB	Romans	15	28	When I have settled this matter, and have secured for the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.
16	OEB	Romans	15	29	And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.
16	OEB	Romans	15	30	I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.
16	OEB	Romans	15	31	Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;
16	OEB	Romans	15	32	so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.
16	OEB	Romans	15	33	May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.
16	OEB	Romans	16	1	I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is a minister of the church at Cenchreae;
16	OEB	Romans	16	2	and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others.
16	OEB	Romans	16	3	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,
16	OEB	Romans	16	4	who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.
16	OEB	Romans	16	5	Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;
16	OEB	Romans	16	6	to Mary, who worked hard for you;
16	OEB	Romans	16	7	to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;
16	OEB	Romans	16	8	to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus;
16	OEB	Romans	16	9	to Urban, our fellow worker in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys;

16	OEB	Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.

16	OEB	Romans	16	25	Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past ages was kept secret but now has been revealed
16	OEB	Romans	16	26	and, in obedience to the command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith –
16	OEB	Romans	16	27	to him, I say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
16	WEB	Romans	1	1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,
16	WEB	Romans	1	2	which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
16	WEB	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
16	WEB	Romans	1	4	who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
16	WEB	Romans	1	5	through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;
16	WEB	Romans	1	6	among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;
16	WEB	Romans	1	7	to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
16	WEB	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,
16	WEB	Romans	1	10	requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.
16	WEB	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;
16	WEB	Romans	1	12	that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.
16	WEB	Romans	1	13	Now I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
16	WEB	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.
16	WEB	Romans	1	15	So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.
16	WEB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.
16	WEB	Romans	1	17	For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}
16	WEB	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
16	WEB	Romans	1	19	because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.
16	WEB	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.
16	WEB	Romans	1	21	Because, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.
16	WEB	Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
16	WEB	Romans	1	23	and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.
16	WEB	Romans	1	24	Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,
16	WEB	Romans	1	25	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.  Amen.
16	WEB	Romans	1	26	For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.
16	WEB	Romans	1	27	Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.
16	WEB	Romans	1	28	Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
16	WEB	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,
16	WEB	Romans	1	30	backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
16	WEB	Romans	1	31	without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;
16	WEB	Romans	1	32	who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.
16	WEB	Romans	2	1	Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.
16	WEB	Romans	2	2	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.
16	WEB	Romans	2	3	Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?
16	WEB	Romans	2	4	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
16	WEB	Romans	2	5	But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;
16	WEB	Romans	2	6	who will pay back to everyone according to their works:{Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12}
16	WEB	Romans	2	7	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;
16	WEB	Romans	2	8	but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,
16	WEB	Romans	2	9	oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
16	WEB	Romans	2	10	But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
16	WEB	Romans	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.
16	WEB	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law.  As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
16	WEB	Romans	2	13	For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified
16	WEB	Romans	2	14	(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,
16	WEB	Romans	2	15	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)
16	WEB	Romans	2	16	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	2	17	Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,
16	WEB	Romans	2	18	and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
16	WEB	Romans	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
16	WEB	Romans	2	20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.
16	WEB	Romans	2	21	You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?
16	WEB	Romans	2	22	You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery.  Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
16	WEB	Romans	2	23	You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?
16	WEB	Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,{Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22} just as it is written.
16	WEB	Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
16	WEB	Romans	2	26	If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?
16	WEB	Romans	2	27	Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?
16	WEB	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;
16	WEB	Romans	2	29	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
16	WEB	Romans	3	1	Then what advantage does the Jew have?  Or what is the profit of circumcision?
16	WEB	Romans	3	2	Much in every way!  Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
16	WEB	Romans	3	3	For what if some were without faith?  Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?
16	WEB	Romans	3	4	May it never be!  Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment.{Psalm 51:4}
16	WEB	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say?  Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.
16	WEB	Romans	3	6	May it never be!  For then how will God judge the world?
16	WEB	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
16	WEB	Romans	3	8	Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Those who say so are justly condemned.
16	WEB	Romans	3	9	What then?  Are we better than they?  No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
16	WEB	Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is no one righteous; no, not one.
16	WEB	Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands.  There is no one who seeks after God.
16	WEB	Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside.  They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one.{Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Ecclesiastes 7:20}
16	WEB	Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open tomb.  With their tongues they have used deceit.{Psalm 5:9} The poison of vipers is under their lips;{Psalm 140:3}
16	WEB	Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.{Psalm 10:7}
16	WEB	Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood.
16	WEB	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways.
16	WEB	Romans	3	17	The way of peace, they haven't known.{Isaiah 59:7-8}
16	WEB	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.{Psalm 36:1}
16	WEB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.
16	WEB	Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight.  For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
16	WEB	Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;
16	WEB	Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe.  For there is no distinction,
16	WEB	Romans	3	23	for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;
16	WEB	Romans	3	24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
16	WEB	Romans	3	25	whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice{or, a propitiation}, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;
16	WEB	Romans	3	26	to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.
16	WEB	Romans	3	27	Where then is the boasting?  It is excluded.  By what manner of law? Of works?  No, but by a law of faith.
16	WEB	Romans	3	28	We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
16	WEB	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only?  Isn't he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
16	WEB	Romans	3	30	since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.
16	WEB	Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify the law through faith?  May it never be! No, we establish the law.
16	WEB	Romans	4	1	What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?
16	WEB	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.
16	WEB	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say?  Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}
16	WEB	Romans	4	4	Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt.
16	WEB	Romans	4	5	But to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	4	6	Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,
16	WEB	Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
16	WEB	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.{Psalm 32:1-2}
16	WEB	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also?  For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	4	10	How then was it counted?  When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?  Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
16	WEB	Romans	4	11	He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.
16	WEB	Romans	4	12	The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
16	WEB	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
16	WEB	Romans	4	14	For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.
16	WEB	Romans	4	15	For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.
16	WEB	Romans	4	16	For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
16	WEB	Romans	4	17	As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations.{Genesis 17:5} This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.
16	WEB	Romans	4	18	Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So will your seed be.{Genesis 15:5}
16	WEB	Romans	4	19	Without being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.
16	WEB	Romans	4	20	Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,
16	WEB	Romans	4	21	and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
16	WEB	Romans	4	22	Therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}
16	WEB	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,
16	WEB	Romans	4	24	but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,
16	WEB	Romans	4	25	who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
16	WEB	Romans	5	1	Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
16	WEB	Romans	5	2	through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand.  We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
16	WEB	Romans	5	3	Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;
16	WEB	Romans	5	4	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:
16	WEB	Romans	5	5	and hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
16	WEB	Romans	5	6	For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
16	WEB	Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man.  Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.
16	WEB	Romans	5	8	But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
16	WEB	Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him.
16	WEB	Romans	5	10	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.
16	WEB	Romans	5	11	Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
16	WEB	Romans	5	12	Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.
16	WEB	Romans	5	13	For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.
16	WEB	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.
16	WEB	Romans	5	15	But the free gift isn't like the trespass.  For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
16	WEB	Romans	5	16	The gift is not as through one who sinned:  for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.
16	WEB	Romans	5	17	For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	5	18	So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.
16	WEB	Romans	5	19	For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.
16	WEB	Romans	5	20	The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;
16	WEB	Romans	5	21	that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
16	WEB	Romans	6	1	What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
16	WEB	Romans	6	2	May it never be!  We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?
16	WEB	Romans	6	3	Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
16	WEB	Romans	6	4	We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
16	WEB	Romans	6	5	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;
16	WEB	Romans	6	6	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.
16	WEB	Romans	6	7	For he who has died has been freed from sin.
16	WEB	Romans	6	8	But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;
16	WEB	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!
16	WEB	Romans	6	10	For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.
16	WEB	Romans	6	11	Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
16	WEB	Romans	6	12	Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.
16	WEB	Romans	6	13	Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
16	WEB	Romans	6	14	For sin will not have dominion over you.  For you are not under law, but under grace.
16	WEB	Romans	6	15	What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?  May it never be!
16	WEB	Romans	6	16	Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
16	WEB	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.
16	WEB	Romans	6	18	Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	6	19	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.
16	WEB	Romans	6	20	For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	6	21	What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed?  For the end of those things is death.
16	WEB	Romans	6	22	But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.
16	WEB	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
16	WEB	Romans	7	1	Or don't you know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?
16	WEB	Romans	7	2	For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
16	WEB	Romans	7	3	So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress.  But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
16	WEB	Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.
16	WEB	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
16	WEB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
16	WEB	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, You shall not covet.{Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21}
16	WEB	Romans	7	8	But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting.  For apart from the law, sin is dead.
16	WEB	Romans	7	9	I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
16	WEB	Romans	7	10	The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;
16	WEB	Romans	7	11	for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
16	WEB	Romans	7	12	Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
16	WEB	Romans	7	13	Did then that which is good become death to me?  May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
16	WEB	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
16	WEB	Romans	7	15	For I don't know what I am doing.  For I don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.
16	WEB	Romans	7	16	But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
16	WEB	Romans	7	17	So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
16	WEB	Romans	7	18	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing that which is good.
16	WEB	Romans	7	19	For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice.
16	WEB	Romans	7	20	But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
16	WEB	Romans	7	21	I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.
16	WEB	Romans	7	22	For I delight in God's law after the inward man,
16	WEB	Romans	7	23	but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
16	WEB	Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am!  Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?
16	WEB	Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!  So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.
16	WEB	Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.{NU omits who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit}
16	WEB	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
16	WEB	Romans	8	3	For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;
16	WEB	Romans	8	4	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
16	WEB	Romans	8	5	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
16	WEB	Romans	8	6	For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;
16	WEB	Romans	8	7	because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be.
16	WEB	Romans	8	8	Those who are in the flesh can't please God.
16	WEB	Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you.  But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
16	WEB	Romans	8	10	If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.
16	WEB	Romans	8	12	So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
16	WEB	Romans	8	13	For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
16	WEB	Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.
16	WEB	Romans	8	15	For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba{Abba is an Aramaic word for father or daddy, often used affectionately and respectfully in prayer to our Father in heaven.}!  Father!
16	WEB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;
16	WEB	Romans	8	17	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.
16	WEB	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.
16	WEB	Romans	8	19	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
16	WEB	Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope
16	WEB	Romans	8	21	that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
16	WEB	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
16	WEB	Romans	8	23	Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.
16	WEB	Romans	8	24	For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?
16	WEB	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for it with patience.
16	WEB	Romans	8	26	In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought.  But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.
16	WEB	Romans	8	27	He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.
16	WEB	Romans	8	28	We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
16	WEB	Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}
16	WEB	Romans	8	30	Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified.  Whom he justified, those he also glorified.
16	WEB	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say about these things?  If God is for us, who can be against us?
16	WEB	Romans	8	32	He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?
16	WEB	Romans	8	33	Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.
16	WEB	Romans	8	34	Who is he who condemns?  It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
16	WEB	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
16	WEB	Romans	8	36	Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.{Psalm 44:22}
16	WEB	Romans	8	37	No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
16	WEB	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
16	WEB	Romans	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
16	WEB	Romans	9	1	I tell the truth in Christ.  I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,
16	WEB	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
16	WEB	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,
16	WEB	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
16	WEB	Romans	9	5	of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever.  Amen.
16	WEB	Romans	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.
16	WEB	Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, In Isaac will your seed be called.{Genesis 21:12}
16	WEB	Romans	9	8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.
16	WEB	Romans	9	9	For this is a word of promise, At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.{Genesis 18:10,14}
16	WEB	Romans	9	10	Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
16	WEB	Romans	9	11	For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,
16	WEB	Romans	9	12	it was said to her, The elder will serve the younger.{Genesis 25:23}
16	WEB	Romans	9	13	Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.{Malachi 1:2-3}
16	WEB	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  May it never be!
16	WEB	Romans	9	15	For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.{Exodus 33:19}
16	WEB	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.
16	WEB	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.{Exodus 9:16}
16	WEB	Romans	9	18	So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.
16	WEB	Romans	9	19	You will say then to me, Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?
16	WEB	Romans	9	20	But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God?  Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, Why did you make me like this?{Isaiah 29:16; 45:9}
16	WEB	Romans	9	21	Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
16	WEB	Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,
16	WEB	Romans	9	23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
16	WEB	Romans	9	24	us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
16	WEB	Romans	9	25	As he says also in Hosea, I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people; and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved.{Hosea 2:23}
16	WEB	Romans	9	26	It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' There they will be called 'children of the living God.'{Hosea 1:10}
16	WEB	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;
16	WEB	Romans	9	28	for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.{Isaiah 10:22-23}
16	WEB	Romans	9	29	As Isaiah has said before, Unless the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)} had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.{Isaiah 1:9}
16	WEB	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then?  That the Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;
16	WEB	Romans	9	31	but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness.
16	WEB	Romans	9	32	Why?  Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law.  They stumbled over the stumbling stone;
16	WEB	Romans	9	33	even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.{Isaiah 8:14; 28:16}
16	WEB	Romans	10	1	Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.
16	WEB	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
16	WEB	Romans	10	3	For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
16	WEB	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the fulfillment{or, completion, or end} of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
16	WEB	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, The one who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}
16	WEB	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith says this, Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'{Deuteronomy 30:12} (that is, to bring Christ down);
16	WEB	Romans	10	7	or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'{Deuteronomy 30:13} (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)
16	WEB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say?  The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;{Deuteronomy 30:14} that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
16	WEB	Romans	10	9	that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
16	WEB	Romans	10	10	For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
16	WEB	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says, Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}
16	WEB	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.
16	WEB	Romans	10	13	For, Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.{Joel 2:32}
16	WEB	Romans	10	14	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?
16	WEB	Romans	10	15	And how will they preach unless they are sent?  As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!{Isaiah 52:7}
16	WEB	Romans	10	16	But they didn't all listen to the glad news.  For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?{Isaiah 53:1}
16	WEB	Romans	10	17	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
16	WEB	Romans	10	18	But I say, didn't they hear?  Yes, most certainly, Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.{Psalm 19:4}
16	WEB	Romans	10	19	But I ask, didn't Israel know?  First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.{Deuteronomy 32:31}
16	WEB	Romans	10	20	Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found by those who didn't seek me.  I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me.{Isaiah 65:1}
16	WEB	Romans	10	21	But as to Israel he says, All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.{Isaiah 65:2}
16	WEB	Romans	11	1	I ask then, did God reject his people?  May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
16	WEB	Romans	11	2	God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew.  Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah?  How he pleads with God against Israel:
16	WEB	Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.{1 Kings 19:10,14}
16	WEB	Romans	11	4	But how does God answer him?  I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.{1 Kings 19:18}
16	WEB	Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
16	WEB	Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.  But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.
16	WEB	Romans	11	7	What then?  That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
16	WEB	Romans	11	8	According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.{Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10}
16	WEB	Romans	11	9	David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.
16	WEB	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always.{Psalm 69:22,23}
16	WEB	Romans	11	11	I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?  May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
16	WEB	Romans	11	12	Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?
16	WEB	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you who are Gentiles.  Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
16	WEB	Romans	11	14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
16	WEB	Romans	11	15	For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?
16	WEB	Romans	11	16	If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump.  If the root is holy, so are the branches.
16	WEB	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;
16	WEB	Romans	11	18	don't boast over the branches.  But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.
16	WEB	Romans	11	19	You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
16	WEB	Romans	11	20	True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith.  Don't be conceited, but fear;
16	WEB	Romans	11	21	for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
16	WEB	Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and severity of God.  Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
16	WEB	Romans	11	23	They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
16	WEB	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
16	WEB	Romans	11	25	For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,
16	WEB	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved.  Even as it is written, There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
16	WEB	Romans	11	27	This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins.{Isaiah 59:20-21; 27:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34}
16	WEB	Romans	11	28	Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.
16	WEB	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
16	WEB	Romans	11	30	For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
16	WEB	Romans	11	31	even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.
16	WEB	Romans	11	32	For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.
16	WEB	Romans	11	33	Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
16	WEB	Romans	11	34	For who has known the mind of the Lord?  Or who has been his counselor?{Isaiah 40:13}
16	WEB	Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?{Job 41:11}
16	WEB	Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever!  Amen.
16	WEB	Romans	12	1	Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.
16	WEB	Romans	12	2	Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.
16	WEB	Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.
16	WEB	Romans	12	4	For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,
16	WEB	Romans	12	5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
16	WEB	Romans	12	6	Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
16	WEB	Romans	12	7	or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;
16	WEB	Romans	12	8	or he who exhorts, to his exhorting:  he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
16	WEB	Romans	12	9	Let love be without hypocrisy.  Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.
16	WEB	Romans	12	10	In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;
16	WEB	Romans	12	11	not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
16	WEB	Romans	12	12	rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;
16	WEB	Romans	12	13	contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.
16	WEB	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.
16	WEB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice.  Weep with those who weep.
16	WEB	Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another.  Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.
16	WEB	Romans	12	17	Repay no one evil for evil.  Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.
16	WEB	Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.
16	WEB	Romans	12	19	Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath.  For it is written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.{Deuteronomy 32:35}
16	WEB	Romans	12	20	Therefore If your enemy is hungry, feed him.  If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.{Proverbs 25:21-22}
16	WEB	Romans	12	21	Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
16	WEB	Romans	13	1	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.
16	WEB	Romans	13	2	Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.
16	WEB	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,
16	WEB	Romans	13	4	for he is a servant of God to you for good.  But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.
16	WEB	Romans	13	5	Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
16	WEB	Romans	13	6	For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.
16	WEB	Romans	13	7	Give therefore to everyone what you owe:  taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.
16	WEB	Romans	13	8	Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
16	WEB	Romans	13	9	For the commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not give false testimony, You shall not covet,{TR adds You shall not give false testimony,}{Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deuteronomy 5:17-19,21} and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}
16	WEB	Romans	13	10	Love doesn't harm a neighbor.  Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.
16	WEB	Romans	13	11	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.
16	WEB	Romans	13	12	The night is far gone, and the day is near.  Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.
16	WEB	Romans	13	13	Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.
16	WEB	Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
16	WEB	Romans	14	1	Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.
16	WEB	Romans	14	2	One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.
16	WEB	Romans	14	3	Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.
16	WEB	Romans	14	4	Who are you who judge another's servant?  To his own lord he stands or falls.  Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.
16	WEB	Romans	14	5	One man esteems one day as more important.  Another esteems every day alike.  Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
16	WEB	Romans	14	6	He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks.
16	WEB	Romans	14	7	For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.
16	WEB	Romans	14	8	For if we live, we live to the Lord.  Or if we die, we die to the Lord.  If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.
16	WEB	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
16	WEB	Romans	14	10	But you, why do you judge your brother?  Or you again, why do you despise your brother?  For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	14	11	For it is written, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will bow.  Every tongue will confess to God.'{Isaiah 45:23}
16	WEB	Romans	14	12	So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.
16	WEB	Romans	14	13	Therefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling.
16	WEB	Romans	14	14	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
16	WEB	Romans	14	15	Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love.  Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
16	WEB	Romans	14	16	Then don't let your good be slandered,
16	WEB	Romans	14	17	for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
16	WEB	Romans	14	18	For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.
16	WEB	Romans	14	19	So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.
16	WEB	Romans	14	20	Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake.  All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.
16	WEB	Romans	14	21	It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.
16	WEB	Romans	14	22	Do you have faith?  Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves.
16	WEB	Romans	14	23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. (14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.{TR places verses 24-26 after Romans 16:24 as verses 25-27.}
16	WEB	Romans	15	1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
16	WEB	Romans	15	2	Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.
16	WEB	Romans	15	3	For even Christ didn't please himself.  But, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.{Psalm 69:9}
16	WEB	Romans	15	4	For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
16	WEB	Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,
16	WEB	Romans	15	6	that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	15	7	Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,{TR reads us instead of you} to the glory of God.
16	WEB	Romans	15	8	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,
16	WEB	Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.{2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 18:49}
16	WEB	Romans	15	10	Again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.{Deuteronomy 32:43}
16	WEB	Romans	15	11	Again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!  Let all the peoples praise him.{Psalm 117:1}
16	WEB	Romans	15	12	Again, Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope.{Isaiah 11:10}
16	WEB	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
16	WEB	Romans	15	14	I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.
16	WEB	Romans	15	15	But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,
16	WEB	Romans	15	16	that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
16	WEB	Romans	15	17	I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
16	WEB	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
16	WEB	Romans	15	19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;
16	WEB	Romans	15	20	yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation.
16	WEB	Romans	15	21	But, as it is written, They will see, to whom no news of him came. They who haven't heard will understand.{Isaiah 52:15}
16	WEB	Romans	15	22	Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,
16	WEB	Romans	15	23	but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,
16	WEB	Romans	15	24	whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
16	WEB	Romans	15	25	But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
16	WEB	Romans	15	26	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.
16	WEB	Romans	15	27	Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.
16	WEB	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
16	WEB	Romans	15	29	I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.
16	WEB	Romans	15	30	Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
16	WEB	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
16	WEB	Romans	15	32	that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.
16	WEB	Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all.  Amen.
16	WEB	Romans	16	1	I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant{or, deacon} of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,
16	WEB	Romans	16	2	that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.
16	WEB	Romans	16	3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
16	WEB	Romans	16	4	who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles.
16	WEB	Romans	16	5	Greet the assembly that is in their house.  Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.

16	WEB	Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss.  The assemblies of Christ greet you.
16	WEB	Romans	16	17	Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.
16	WEB	Romans	16	18	For those who are such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.
16	WEB	Romans	16	19	For your obedience has become known to all.  I rejoice therefore over you.  But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.

17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	1	In the days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	2	He was named Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	4	And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	5	And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	6	And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with both her daughters in law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people, and had given them food.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters in law: and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	8	She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	9	May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	10	And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	11	But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	12	Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	13	If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man’s estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother in law.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	15	And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her. To her gods, etc.... Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the false gods she had formerly worshipped: but by this manner of speech, insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her false gods and return to the Lord the God of Israel.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	16	She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	17	The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more also, if aught but death part me and thee. The Lord do so and so, etc.... A form of swearing usual in the history of the Old Testament, by which the person wished such and such evils to fall upon them, if they did not do what they said.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	18	Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	19	So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	20	But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful,) but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	21	I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted?
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	1	22	So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter in law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest. Ruth Chapter 2 Ruth gleaneth in the field of Booz, who sheweth her favour.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	1	Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	2	And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder, that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	3	She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	4	And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	5	And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	6	And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi, from the land of Moab,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	7	And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	8	And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	9	And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	10	She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a woman of another country?
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	11	And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	12	The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	13	And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	14	And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	15	And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	16	And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	17	She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	18	Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother in law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	19	And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned today, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man’s name, that he was called Booz.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	20	And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	21	And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	22	And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man’s field some one may resist thee.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	2	23	So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns. Ruth Chapter 3 Ruth instructed by her mother in law lieth at Booz’s feet, claiming him for her husband by the law of affinity: she receiveth a good answer, and six measures of barley.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	1	After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	2	This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	4	And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	5	She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	6	And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	7	And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	8	And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	9	And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	10	And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich. Thy latter kindness, viz.... to thy husband deceased in seeking to keep up his name and family by marrying his relation according to the law, and not following after young men. For Booz, it seems, was then in years.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	11	Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	12	Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	13	Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	14	So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	15	And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	16	And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	17	And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	3	18	And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said. Ruth Chapter 4 Upon the refusal of the nearer kinsman, Booz marrieth Ruth, who bringeth forth Obed, the grandfather of David.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	1	Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	2	And Booz, taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	3	They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	4	I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	5	And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman’s hand, thou must take also Ruth, the Moabitess, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	6	He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	7	Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	8	So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	9	And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and Chelion’s, and Mahalon’s, of the hand of Noemi:
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	10	And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	11	Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients, answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem: Ephrata.... Another name of Bethlehem.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	12	And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	13	Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	14	And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	15	And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	16	And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	17	And the women, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	18	These are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esron,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	19	Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	20	Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	21	Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,
17	DRB	The Book of Ruth	4	22	Obed begot Isai, Isai begot David.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	4	And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	9	The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	13	Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	16	And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	17	Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	21	I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	7	And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	12	The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	14	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	16	And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	1	Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	2	And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	6	And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	12	And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	15	Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	1	Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	3	And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	4	And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	6	And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	7	Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	12	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	19	And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	20	And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	21	And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
17	KJV	The Book of Ruth	4	22	And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	1	In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	2	His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,
17	OEB	Ruth	1	3	Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,
17	OEB	Ruth	1	4	who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
17	OEB	Ruth	1	5	Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	6	So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the LORD  had remembered his people and given them food.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	7	As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,
17	OEB	Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the LORD  be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	9	The LORD  grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	10	and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?
17	OEB	Ruth	1	12	Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,
17	OEB	Ruth	1	13	would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the LORD  has sent me adversity.”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	14	Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	15	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;
17	OEB	Ruth	1	17	I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the LORD  bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	19	So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	20	“Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara^[ 1:20 In Hebrew “Naomi” means “pleasant,” and “Mara” means “bitter.”], for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.
17	OEB	Ruth	1	21	I had plenty when I left, but the LORD  has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the LORD  has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?”
17	OEB	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	1	Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	3	So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	4	When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The LORD  be with you,” they answered him, “May the LORD  bless you.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	5	“Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	6	The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	7	She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	9	Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	10	Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	11	Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	12	May the LORD  repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	13	Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	15	When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	18	Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.
17	OEB	Ruth	2	19	“Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the LORD  rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	21	“He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.”
17	OEB	Ruth	2	23	So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	1	One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?
17	OEB	Ruth	3	2	Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?
17	OEB	Ruth	3	3	Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	4	Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.”
17	OEB	Ruth	3	5	“I will do as you say.” Ruth said to her.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	8	At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!
17	OEB	Ruth	3	9	“Who are you?” he said. “I am Ruth your servant,” she answered, “Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.”
17	OEB	Ruth	3	10	He said, “May you be blest by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	11	My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	13	Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the LORD  lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.”
17	OEB	Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognize her, for Boaz said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.”
17	OEB	Ruth	3	15	He also said, “Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.” So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	16	When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “Is it you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.
17	OEB	Ruth	3	17	“He gave me these six measures of barley,” she said, “for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.”
17	OEB	Ruth	3	18	“Wait quietly, my daughter.” Naomi said, “Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	1	Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, “Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.” So he stopped and sat down.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	2	Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the near relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,
17	OEB	Ruth	4	4	and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	6	“I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,” the near relative said. “You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	7	Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	8	So when the near relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	10	Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	11	Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD  make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	12	From the children whom the LORD  will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the LORD  gave to her a son.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD  who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	15	This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!”
17	OEB	Ruth	4	16	So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	17	The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
17	OEB	Ruth	4	18	This is the genealogy of Perez:
17	OEB	Ruth	4	19	Hezron of Ram,
17	OEB	Ruth	4	20	Amminidab of Nashon,
17	OEB	Ruth	4	21	Salmon of Boaz,
17	OEB	Ruth	4	22	Obed of Jesse,
17	WEB	Ruth	1	1	It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	3	Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	4	They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	5	Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	7	She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	9	Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	10	They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	11	Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
17	WEB	Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;
17	WEB	Ruth	1	13	would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh is gone forth against me.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	14	They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	15	She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	16	Ruth said, Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;
17	WEB	Ruth	1	17	where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?
17	WEB	Ruth	1	20	She said to them, Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
17	WEB	Ruth	1	21	I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
17	WEB	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	1	Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	3	She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	4	Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?
17	WEB	Ruth	2	6	The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
17	WEB	Ruth	2	7	She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
17	WEB	Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn't know before.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	12	Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	14	At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	15	When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	18	She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	21	Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.
17	WEB	Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	1	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
17	WEB	Ruth	3	2	Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	3	Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	4	It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	5	She said to her, All that you say I will do.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	6	She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	8	It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	9	He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	10	He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	11	Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	13	Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	14	She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	15	He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	17	She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said, Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.
17	WEB	Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	2	He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here.  They sat down.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	3	He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
17	WEB	Ruth	4	4	I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	6	The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you; for I can't redeem it.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	7	Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	8	So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	9	Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	11	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
17	WEB	Ruth	4	12	and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	15	He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	17	The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
17	WEB	Ruth	4	18	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became the father of Hezron,
17	WEB	Ruth	4	19	and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,
17	WEB	Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,
17	WEB	Ruth	4	21	and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,

The preaching of the apostle, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God: but with sincerity: but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 He needs no commendatory letters. The glory of the ministry of the New Testament.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	2	You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	3	Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written: not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	4	And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter but in the spirit. For the letter killeth: but the spirit quickeneth. The letter.... Not rightly understood, and taken without the spirit.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	7	Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious (so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance), which is made void:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	14	But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	15	But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	16	But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	3	18	But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians Chapter 4 The sincerity of his preaching. His comfort in his afflictions.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	2	But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God: but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience, in the sight of God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	3	And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord: and ourselves your servants through Jesus.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God and not of us.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	8	In all things we suffer tribulation: but are not distressed. We are straitened: but are not destitute.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	9	We suffer persecution: but are not forsaken. We are cast down: but we perish not.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake: that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us: but life in you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe. For which cause we speak also:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and place us with you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes: that the grace, abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not: but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	17	For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure, exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal: but the things which are not seen, are eternal. 2 Corinthians Chapter 5 He is willing to leave his earthly mansion to be with the Lord. His charity to the Corinthians.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	1	For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	2	For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	3	Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	4	For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	5	Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	6	Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	7	(For we walk by faith and not by sight.)
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	8	But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	9	And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. The proper things of the body.... In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men: but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	12	We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf: that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	14	For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	15	And Christ died for all: that they also who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh: but now we know him so no longer. We know no man according to the flesh.... That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	17	If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	19	For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins. And he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	20	For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	5	21	Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us: that we might be made the justice of God in him. Sin for us.... That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin. 2 Corinthians Chapter 6 He exhorts them to a correspondence with God’s grace and not to associate with unbelievers.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	1	And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	2	For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time: behold, now is the day of salvation.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	4	But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	5	In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	6	In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	7	In the word of truth, in the power of God: by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour: by evil report and good report: as deceivers and yet true: as unknown and yet known:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	9	As dying and behold we live: as chastised and not killed:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching many: as having nothing and possessing all things.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians: our heart is enlarged.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	12	You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are straitened.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	13	But having the same recompense (I speak as to my children): be you also enlarged.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	14	Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God: as God saith: I will dwell in them and walk among them. And I will be their God: and they shall be my people.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore: Go out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	6	18	And I will receive you. And will be a Father to you: and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 2 Corinthians Chapter 7 The apostle’s affection for the Corinthians. His comfort and joy on their account.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	2	Receive us. We have injured no man: we have corrupted no man: we have overreached no man.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before that you are in our hearts: to die together and to live together.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence for you: great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	5	For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest: but we suffered all tribulation. Combats without: fears within.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	6	But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me: so that I rejoiced the more.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	8	For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent. And if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	9	Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge. In all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it: but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	13	Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	14	And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame: but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	15	And his bowels are more abundantly towards you: remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you. 2 Corinthians Chapter 8 He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of Jerusalem.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	1	Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	2	That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity. Simplicity.... That is, sincere bounty and charity.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	4	With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	5	And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God;
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	7	That as in all things you abound in faith and word and knowledge and all carefulness, moreover also in your charity towards us: so in this grace also you may abound.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	8	I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform ye it also in deed: that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	12	For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath: not according to that which he hath not.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	14	In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an equality,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	15	As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	16	And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	18	We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	19	And not that only: but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord and our determined will:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	21	For we forecast what may be good, not only before God but also before men.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much confidence in you,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	23	Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity and of our boasting on your behalf. 2 Corinthians Chapter 9 A further exhortation to almsgiving. The fruits of it.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	1	For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	2	For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past. And your emulation hath provoked very many.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	3	Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	4	Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	6	Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	7	Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound in you: that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	9	As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	10	And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you bread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	11	That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	12	Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	13	By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them and unto all.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	14	And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift. 2 Corinthians Chapter 10 To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the power of his apostleship.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to God, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	5	And every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	6	And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	7	See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ’s let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we also.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	8	For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	9	But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	10	(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	13	But we will not glory beyond our measure: but according to the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the Gospel of Christ.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	15	Not glorying beyond measure in other men’s labours: but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	16	Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the gospel: not to glory in another man’s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	10	18	For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom God commendeth. 2 Corinthians Chapter 11 He is forced to commend himself and his labours, lest the Corinthians should be imposed upon by the false apostles.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	1	Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly! But do bear with me. My folly.... So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel, which you have not received: you might well bear with him.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	6	For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge: but in all things we have been made manifest to you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached unto you the Gospel of God freely?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	8	I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	9	And, when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia. And in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you: and so I will keep myself.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	10	The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do: that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion: that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	13	For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	16	I say again (Let no man think me to be foolish: otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little):
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I speak not according to God: but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	19	For you gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	20	For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	21	I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	22	They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	23	They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes save one.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods: once I was stoned: thrice I suffered shipwreck: a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	26	In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	27	In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches. My daily instance.... The labours that come in, and press upon me every day.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	32	At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall: and so escaped his hands. 2 Corinthians Chapter 12 His raptures and revelations, His being buffeted by Satan. His fear for the Corinthians.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	1	If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ: above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	4	That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	5	For such an one I will glory: but for myself I will glory nothing but in my infirmities.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	6	For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	7	And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	8	For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart from me.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	9	And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Power is made perfect.... The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	10	For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	11	I am become foolish. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you. For I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	12	Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	13	For what is there that you have had less than the other churches but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	14	Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	15	But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls: although loving you more, I be loved less.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	16	But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	17	Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus: and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not in the same steps?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	19	Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ: but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	12	21	Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed. 2 Corinthians Chapter 13 He threatens the impenitent, to provoke them to penance.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	1	Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	2	I have told before and foretell, as present and now absent, to them that sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	3	Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	4	For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	5	Try your own selves if you be in the faith: prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray God that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good and that we may be as reprobates. Reprobates.... that is, without proof, by having no occasion of shewing our power in punishing you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth: but for the truth.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice that we are weak and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification and not unto destruction.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	11	For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace. And the God of peace and of love shall be with you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	12	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you.
18	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians	13	13	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	15	And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	21	For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	14	But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	19	And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	26	In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you.
18	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	1	To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	2	May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	4	who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	5	It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	6	If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	7	and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	8	We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	9	Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	10	And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	11	And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	12	Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	13	We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	14	And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	15	With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	16	To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	17	As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	18	As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	19	The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	20	For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	21	God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	22	also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	23	But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	1	24	I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	1	For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	2	If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	3	So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	4	I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	5	Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	6	The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	7	so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	8	So I entreat you to assure him of your love.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	9	I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	10	Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	11	so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	12	When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	13	I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	14	All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	16	To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	2	17	Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	2	You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	3	All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	4	This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	5	I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	6	our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	7	If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	8	will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	9	For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	10	Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	11	And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	12	With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	13	unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	15	But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	16	Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	17	And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	3	18	And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	2	No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	3	And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	4	people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	5	(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	6	Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	7	This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	8	Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	9	though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	10	We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	11	Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	12	And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	13	But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	14	For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	15	For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	17	The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us a weight of imperishable glory, beyond all measure.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	4	18	We, all the while, gaze not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	2	Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	3	sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found naked.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	4	For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	5	And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	7	For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	8	And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	10	For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	11	Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	12	We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	13	For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	14	It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	15	and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	16	For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	18	But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	19	To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	20	It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	5	21	For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	1	Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	2	For he says –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	3	Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	4	No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	5	in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in hunger;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	6	by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	7	by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	8	amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	9	as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	10	as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	11	We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	12	there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	13	Can you not in return – I appeal to you as I should to children – open your hearts to us?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	14	Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	16	What agreement can there be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	17	Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	6	18	and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,”
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	1	With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect for God, aim at perfect holiness.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	3	I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	4	I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	5	Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	6	But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	7	And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	8	For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	9	I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	10	For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	11	For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	12	So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	13	In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	14	Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	7	16	I am glad that I can feel perfect confidence in you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	1	We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	2	How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	3	I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	4	and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	5	And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	6	And this led us to beg Titus, that since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	7	And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	8	I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	9	For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	10	I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	11	And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	12	For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	13	For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	14	On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	15	As scripture says –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	16	I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your welfare that I have;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	17	for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	18	We are sending with him one of the Lord’s followers whose fame in the service of the good news has spread through all the churches;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	19	and not only that, but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey, in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally administering to the honor of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	20	What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	21	for we are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	22	We are also sending with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his great confidence in you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	23	If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	8	24	Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	1	With reference, indeed, to the fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	2	I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	3	So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	4	Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	6	Remember the saying – ‘Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.’
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	7	Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	8	God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you, so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	9	(As scripture says –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	10	And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the fruits of your righteousness).
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	11	Rich in all things yourselves, you will be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause thanksgiving to be offered to God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	12	For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	13	Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	14	And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	9	15	All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	1	Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	2	I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	3	For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	4	The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	5	We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	6	and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	7	You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	8	Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	9	I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	10	For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	12	We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	13	We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	14	For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	15	Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	16	So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	17	Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	10	18	For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	1	I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	2	I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I promised you in marriage as a pure bride, to one husband – the Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	3	Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	4	For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	5	I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	6	Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	7	Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	9	And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	10	As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	11	Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	12	What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	13	Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	15	It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	16	I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	17	When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	18	As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	19	For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	20	You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	21	I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	26	My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	27	I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	28	And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	32	When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	11	33	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	1	I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	3	And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	4	Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	5	About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	6	Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	7	It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	8	About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	9	But his reply has been –  ‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	10	That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	11	I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	12	The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	13	In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	14	Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	15	For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	16	You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	17	Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	19	Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	20	for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	1	For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	2	I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	3	And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	4	For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	5	Put yourselves to the test, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Examine yourselves. Surely you recognize this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	6	But I hope that you will recognize that we can stand the test.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	7	We pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	8	We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	9	We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	10	This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	11	And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	13	All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.
18	OEB	2 Corinthians	13	14	May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	4	who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	8	For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	9	Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	11	you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this:  the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	14	as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	16	and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the Yes, yes and the No, no?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not Yes and no.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and no, but in him is Yes.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	20	For however many are the promises of God, in him is the Yes. Therefore also through him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	21	Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	22	who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	23	But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	1	24	Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy.  For you stand firm in faith.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	5	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	7	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	9	For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	10	Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	11	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	13	I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	16	to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life.  Who is sufficient for these things?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	3	being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	4	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit.  For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	7	But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	8	won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	9	For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	10	For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	11	For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	13	and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	15	But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	16	But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	2	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	3	Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	4	in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	5	For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	6	seeing it is God who said, Light will shine out of darkness,{Genesis 1:3} who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	8	We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	9	pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	10	always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	12	So then death works in us, but life in you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore I spoke.{Psalm 116:10} We also believe, and therefore also we speak;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	14	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	4	18	while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	2	For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	3	if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	5	Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith, not by sight.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	8	We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	12	For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God.  Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	15	He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	16	Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away.  Behold, all things have become new.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	19	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	20	We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us.  We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	5	21	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	1	Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	2	for he says, At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.{Isaiah 49:8} Behold, now is the acceptable time.  Behold, now is the day of salvation.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	3	We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	4	but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	6	in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	7	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	8	by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	9	as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians.  Our heart is enlarged.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	12	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	13	Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	14	Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity?  Or what communion has light with darkness?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	15	What agreement has Christ with Belial?  Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	16	What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God.  Even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.{Leviticus 26:12; Jeremiah 32:38; Ezekiel 37:27}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	17	Therefore, 'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord.  'Touch no unclean thing.  I will receive you.{Isaiah 52:11; Ezekiel 20:34,41}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	6	18	I will be to you a Father.  You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty.{2 Samuel 7:14; 7:8}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	2	Open your hearts to us.  We wronged no one.  We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	3	I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you.  Great is my boasting on your behalf.  I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	5	For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side.  Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	7	and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it.  For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance.  For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret.  But the sorrow of the world works death.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	11	For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we have been comforted.  In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed.  But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	15	His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	2	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	4	begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	5	This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	7	But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	10	I give a judgment in this:  for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	11	But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	13	For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	14	but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.{Exodus 16:8}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	17	For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	18	We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	19	Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	20	We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	21	Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	1	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	2	for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	4	so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	5	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	6	Remember this:  he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	7	Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	9	As it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.{Psalm 112:9}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	10	Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	11	you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	12	For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	13	seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	14	while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	9	15	Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	2	Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	4	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	5	throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	6	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	7	Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	10	For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves.  But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	14	For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you.  For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	15	not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	16	so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	17	But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	10	18	For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	1	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	4	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	5	For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	6	But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge.  No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	9	When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need.  In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	11	Why?  Because I don't love you?  God knows.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	15	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	16	I say again, let no one think me foolish.  But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	19	For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	20	For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	21	I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews?  So am I. Are they Israelites?  So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham?  So am I.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ?  (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods.  Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck.  I have been a night and a day in the deep.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	26	I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	27	in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation?
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	11	33	Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	1	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	3	I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows),
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	4	how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	6	For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth.  But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	7	By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	9	He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	11	I have become foolish in boasting.  You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	13	For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	14	Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you.  For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
18	WEB	2 Corinthians	12	15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?

19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	1	The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the truth: and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth, The ancient.... That is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one of the twelve apostles then living. To the lady Elect.... Some conjecture that Electa might be the name of a family, or of a particular church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this Epistle from St. John.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father: in truth and charity.

19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a seducer and an antichrist.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him: God speed you. Nor say to him, God speed you.... This admonition is in general, to forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of every one, even of our enemies.
19	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	11	For he that saith unto him: God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.

20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	1	Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ: to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	2	Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	3	As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness are given us through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	4	By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises: that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature: flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	5	And you, employing all care, minister in your faith, virtue: And in virtue, knowledge:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	6	And in knowledge, abstinence: and in abstinence, patience: and in patience, godliness:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	7	And in godliness, love of brotherhood: and in love of brotherhood, charity.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	8	For if these things be with you and abound, they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	9	For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	10	Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the ever-lasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	12	For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the present truth.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	13	But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	14	Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	15	And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease whereby you may keep a memory of these things.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	16	For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ: but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	18	And this voice, we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	19	And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	20	Understanding this first: That no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation.... This shows plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one’s private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world. Some may tell us, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures: they may do so, but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	1	21	For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter Chapter 2 He warns them against false teachers and foretells their punishment.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	1	But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers who shall bring in sects of perdition and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction. Seeds of perdition.... That is, heresies destructive of salvation.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	2	And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not: and their perdition slumbereth not.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	5	And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	6	And reducing the cities of the Sodomites and of the Gomorrhites into ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to those that should after act wickedly,
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	7	And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	8	For in sight and hearing he was just, dwelling among them who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	10	And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government: audacious, self willed, they fear not to bring in sects, blaspheming.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	11	Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment. Bring not a railing judgment, etc.... That is, they use no railing, nor cursing sentence; not even in their conflicts with the evil angels. See St. Jude, ver. 9.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	12	But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	13	Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day: stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in their feasts with you: The delights of a day: that is, the short delights of this world, in which they place all their happiness.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not: alluring unstable souls: having their heart exercised with covetousness: children of malediction.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	15	Leaving the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor who loved the wages of iniquity,
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	16	But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which, speaking with man’s voice, forbade the folly of the prophet.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	17	These are fountains without water and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	18	For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness those who for a little while escape, such as converse in error:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	19	Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	20	For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and overcome: their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	2	22	For, that of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog is returned to his vomit; and: The sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. 2 Peter Chapter 3 Against scoffers denying the second coming of Christ. He declares the sudden dissolution of this world and exhorts to holiness of life.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	1	Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which, I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	2	That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy prophets, and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord and Saviour.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	3	Knowing this first: That in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	4	Saying: Where is his promise or his coming? For since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	5	For this they are wilfully ignorant of: That the heavens were before, and the earth out of water and through water, consisting by the word of God:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	7	But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the ungodly men.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	8	But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	9	The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance,
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	10	But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burnt up.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	11	Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the burning heat?
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	13	But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice dwelleth.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	14	Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	15	And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation: as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	17	You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own steadfastness.
20	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle	3	18	But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity, Amen.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	5	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	3	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
20	KJV	The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	18	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	1	To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	2	May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	3	For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	4	For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	5	Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	6	knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	7	piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	8	For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	9	Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	11	For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	12	I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	13	But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this ‘tent,’ to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	14	for I know that the time for this ‘tent’ of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	15	So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	16	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	17	For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	18	These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	19	And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	20	But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;
20	OEB	2 Peter	1	21	for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	1	But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	2	There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	3	In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	4	Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	5	Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	6	He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	7	but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbors;
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	8	for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	9	The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for ‘the day of judgment’ –
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	10	especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	11	even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	12	These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	13	suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	14	They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	15	Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrongdoing,
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	16	but was rebuked for his offense. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	17	These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	18	With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	19	They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	20	If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	21	It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.
20	OEB	2 Peter	2	22	In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – ‘A dog returns to what it has vomited’ and ‘A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.’
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	1	This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	2	I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Savior given to you through your apostles.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	3	First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	4	will come and ask scoffingly – ‘Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!’
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	5	For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	6	and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	7	But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	8	But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	10	The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	11	Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	12	while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon^[ 3:12 Or: and desire its coming.]. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	13	but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	15	Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	16	It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	17	You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;
20	OEB	2 Peter	3	18	and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	2	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	3	seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	4	by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	5	Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	6	and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	7	and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	8	For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} be more diligent to make your calling and election sure.  For if you do these things, you will never stumble.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	11	For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	12	Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	13	I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	14	knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	15	Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.{Matthew 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35}
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	18	We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	19	We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	20	knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.
20	WEB	2 Peter	1	21	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man:  but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	1	But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	2	Many will follow their immoral{TR reads destructive instead of immoral} ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	3	In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old doesn't linger, and their destruction will not slumber.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	4	For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus{Tartarus is another name for Hell}, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	5	and didn't spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	6	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	7	and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds):
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	9	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	10	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority.  Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	11	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	12	But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	13	receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	15	forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrong-doing;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	16	but he was rebuked for his own disobedience.  A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	18	For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	19	promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	20	For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	21	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
20	WEB	2 Peter	2	22	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns to his own vomit again,{Proverbs 26:11} and the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	1	This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	2	that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	3	knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming?  For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	5	For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	6	by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	7	But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	8	But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	11	Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	12	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	13	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	15	Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	16	as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
20	WEB	2 Peter	3	17	You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.
20	WEB	2 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.  Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians. In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	2	Grace unto you: and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you towards each other aboundeth.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	4	So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations: which you endure
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	5	For an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	6	Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them that trouble you:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	7	And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	8	In a flame of fire, giving vengeance to them who know not God and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	9	Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction, from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his power:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be made wonderful in all them who have believed; because our testimony was believed upon you in that day.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you: That our God would make you worthy of his vocation and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith in power:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1	12	That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2 The day of the Lord is not to come till the man of sin be revealed. The apostle’s traditions are to be observed.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	1	And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and of our gathering together unto him:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	2	That you be not easily moved from your sense nor be terrified, neither by spirit nor by word nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, A revolt.... This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the ancient fathers, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church; which has, in part, happened already, by means of Mahomet, Luther, &c., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the Antichrist. The man of sin.... Here must be meant some particular man, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article: o`, ‘the’ man of sin, ‘the’ son of perdition, ‘the’ adversary or opposer. It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the world.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God. In the temple.... Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will rebuild; or in some Christian church, which he will pervert to his own worship: as Mahomet has done by the churches of the east.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	5	Remember you not that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity already worketh: only that he who now holdeth do hold, until he be taken out of the way.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	8	And then that wicked one shall be revealed: whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: him
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	9	Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power and signs and lying wonders:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	10	And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish: because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying: God shall send.... That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	11	That all may be judged who have not believed the truth but have consented to iniquity.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	12	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit and faith of the truth:
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	13	Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	14	Therefore, brethren, stand fast: and hold the traditions, which you have learned, whether by word or by our epistle. Traditions.... See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be received than their epistles.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	15	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope in grace,
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	2	16	Exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word. 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3 He begs their prayers and warns them against idleness.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	1	For the rest, brethren, pray for us that the word of God may run and may be glorified, even as among you: May run.... That is, may spread itself, and have free course.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	2	And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men: for all men have not faith.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	3	But God is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord that the things which we command, you both do and will do.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	5	And the Lord direct your hearts, in the charity of God and the patience of Christ.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	6	And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us. For we were not disorderly among you.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing: but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	9	Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	10	For also, when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	11	For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly: working not at all, but curiously meddling.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	12	Now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	13	But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	15	Yet do not esteem him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation of Paul with my own hand: which is the sign in every epistle. So I write.
21	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	5	Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	6	Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	9	Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	17	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	15	Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
21	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	1	To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	2	May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	3	Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	4	So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	5	These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	6	since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	8	Then he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	9	They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin – banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	10	when he comes to be honored in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) – as he will be on that day.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	11	With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	1	12	Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honored in you, and you in him.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	1	As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	2	not lightly to let your minds become unsettled or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message or letter purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	3	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. For it will not come before the final rebellion against God, when lawlessness is revealed in human form, headed for destruction.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	4	He is the adversary of everything that is spoken of as a god or as an object of worship, enthroning himself in God’s Temple claiming to be God!
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	5	Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	6	And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	7	Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret, but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless person will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth, annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	9	When the lawless person comes, there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	10	to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	11	That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	12	so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	13	But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	14	To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	15	Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	16	And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	2	17	console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	1	In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	4	Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	6	We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	9	This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	10	Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	12	All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	13	You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	14	If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	15	Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	16	May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	17	I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.
21	OEB	2 Thessalonians	3	18	May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	5	This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	6	Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	8	giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	9	who will pay the penalty:  eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	10	when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	11	To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	1	12	that the name of our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	1	Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	2	not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one deceive you in any way.  For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	4	he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	5	Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	6	Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness already works.  Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	9	even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,

21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	11	Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	12	that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	14	to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	15	So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.
21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,

21	WEB	2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you know how you ought to imitate us.  For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you,

Every part of divine scripture is certainly profitable for all these ends.

22	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	4	And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.
22	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	5	But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober. An evangelist ... a diligent preacher of the gospel.
22	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	6	For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.
22	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	7	I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course: I have kept the faith.
22	DRB	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy	4	8	As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.

22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	1	I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	4	And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	10	For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	15	Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
22	KJV	The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	1	From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	3	I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	4	as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	5	now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	6	And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	7	For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	8	Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	9	It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	10	and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and immortality to light by that good news,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	11	of which I was myself appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	12	That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	13	Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	14	Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	15	You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	17	On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	1	You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	2	and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	3	Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	4	A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	5	No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	6	The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	7	Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	8	Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	9	in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	10	and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	11	How true this saying is – ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	12	If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	13	If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	14	Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	15	Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	16	Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	17	and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	18	They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	19	Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription –
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	21	If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	22	Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	23	Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	24	and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	25	They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	2	26	and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	1	Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	2	People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	3	incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	4	treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	5	and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	6	For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	7	are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	9	They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	10	But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	11	as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	12	Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	13	but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	14	You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	15	and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	16	All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;
22	OEB	2 Timothy	3	17	so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	1	I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	2	Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	3	For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	4	They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	5	But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	6	As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	7	I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	8	And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	9	Do your utmost to come to me soon,
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	10	for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	11	There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	12	I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	13	Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	15	You must also be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	16	At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	19	Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	21	Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers.
22	OEB	2 Timothy	4	22	May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	3	I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience.  How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	4	longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	5	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	6	For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	7	For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	8	Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	9	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	10	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	11	For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	12	For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	13	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	15	This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	16	May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	17	but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
22	WEB	2 Timothy	1	18	(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	1	You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	2	The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	3	You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	4	No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	5	Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	6	The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	9	in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	11	This saying is faithful:  For if we died with him, we will also live with him.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	12	If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him, he also will deny us.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	15	Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	16	But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	17	and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	18	men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	19	However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his,{Numbers 16:5} and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads Christ instead of the Lord} depart from unrighteousness.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay.  Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	21	If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	22	Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	23	But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	24	The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	25	in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	2	26	and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	1	But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	3	without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	4	traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	5	holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	6	For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	7	always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	8	Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	9	But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	10	But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	11	persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.  I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	12	Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	13	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	14	But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	15	From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	16	Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	1	I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	2	preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	4	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	5	But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	6	For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	8	From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	9	Be diligent to come to me soon,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	10	for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	12	But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	13	Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	15	of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	16	At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	18	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.
22	WEB	2 Timothy	4	21	Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.

23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	2	Mercy unto you and peace: and charity be fulfilled.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	3	Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk in truth. No greater grace.... that is nothing that gives me greater joy and satisfaction.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	4	For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long ago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord Jesus Christ.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the brethren: and that for strangers,
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	5	I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church. Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God:
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	6	And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day. Principality.... That is, the state in which they were first created, their original dignity.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles. Taking nothing of the Gentiles.... These ministers of the gospel are commended by St. John, who took nothing from the Gentiles, lest they should seem to preach in order to get money by it.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	7	As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such: that we may be fellow helpers of the truth.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	8	In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise dominion and blaspheme majesty. Blaspheme majesty.... Speak evil of them that are in dignity; and even utter blasphemies against the divine majesty.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	I had written perhaps to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	9	When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee. Contended about the body, etc.... This contention, which is no where else mentioned in holy writ, was originally known by revelation, and transmitted by tradition. It is thought the occasion of it was, that the devil would have had the body buried in such a place and manner, as to be worshipped by the Jews with divine honours. Command thee.... or rebuke thee.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works which he doth, with malicious words prating against us. And as if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church. Diotrephes who loveth.... This man seemeth to be in power, but not a friend to the faithful; therefore this part of the letter might be an admonition to him from the apostle.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	10	But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	11	Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil: but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: he that doth evil hath not seen God.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	11	Woe unto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have perished in the contradiction of Core. Gone in the way, etc.... Heretics follow the way of Cain, by murdering the souls of their brethren; the way of Balaam, by putting a scandal before the people of God, for their own private ends; and the way of Core or Korah, by their opposition to the church governors of divine appointment.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	12	To Demetrius, testimony is given by all, and by the truth itself: yea and we also give testimony. And thou knowest that our testimony is true.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	12	These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding themselves: clouds without water, which are carried about by winds: trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots:
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	13	I had many things to write unto thee: but I would not by ink and pen write to thee.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion: wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	14	But I hope speedily to see thee: and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. THE CATHOLIC EPISTLE OF ST. JUDE St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve Apostles and brother to St. James the Less. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may be inferred from verse 17 that few or none of the Apostles were then living, except St. John. He inveighs against the heresies and wicked practices of the Simonians, Nicolaites, and Gnostics, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and similes, He exhorts the faithful to contend earnestly for the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics. Jude Chapter 1 He exhorts them to stand to the faith first delivered to them and to beware of heretics.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	14	Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints: Prophesied.... This prophecy was either known by tradition, or from some book that is since lost.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	15	To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for all the works of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly: and for all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	16	These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to their own desires: and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring persons, for gain’s sake.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	17	But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful, etc.... He now exhorts the faithful to remain steadfast in the belief and practice of what they had heard from the apostles, who had also foretold that in aftertimes (lit. in the last time) there should be false teachers, scoffing and ridiculing all revealed truths, abandoning themselves to their passions and lusts; who separate themselves from the Catholic communion by heresies and schisms. Sensual men.... carried away and enslaved by the pleasures of the senses.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	18	Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers, walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	19	These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not the Spirit.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	20	But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting. Building yourselves upon your most holy faith.... Raising by your actions, a spiritual building, founded, 1st, upon faith; 2d, on the love of God; 3d, upon hope, whilst you are waiting for the mercies of God, and the reward of eternal life; 4th, joined with the great duty of prayer.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	22	And some indeed reprove, being judged:
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	23	But others save, pulling them out of the fire. And on others have mercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal. And some indeed reprove being judged.... He gives them another instruction to practice charity in endeavouring to convert their neighbour, where they will meet with three sorts of persons: 1st, With persons obstinate in their errors and sins; these may be said to be already judged and condemned; they are to be sharply reprehended, reproved, and if possible convinced of their error. 2d, As to others you must endeavour to save them, by pulling them, as it were, out of the fire, from the ruin they stand in great danger of. 3d, You must have mercy on others in fear, when you see them through ignorance of frailty, in danger of being drawn into the snares of these heretics; with these you must deal more gently and mildly, with a charitable compassion, hating always, and teaching others to hate the carnal garment which is spotted, their sensual and corrupt manners, that defile both the soul and body.
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	24	Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
23	DRB	The Third Epistle of St. John the Apostle	1	25	To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and for all ages of ages. Amen. Now to him, etc.... St. Jude concludes his epistle with this doxology of praising God, and praying to the only God our Saviour, which may either signify God the Father, or God as equally agreeing to all the three persons, who are equally the cause of Christ’s incarnation, and man’s salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who, being God from eternity, took upon him our human nature, that he might become our Redeemer.

23	KJV	The Third Epistle General of John	1	7	Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
23	KJV	The Third Epistle General of John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.
23	KJV	The Third Epistle General of John	1	9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

23	OEB	3 John	1	2	Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health – I know that all is well with your soul.
23	OEB	3 John	1	3	For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.
23	OEB	3 John	1	4	Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.
23	OEB	3 John	1	5	Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other followers – even when they are strangers to you.
23	OEB	3 John	1	6	They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.
23	OEB	3 John	1	7	For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.
23	OEB	3 John	1	8	Therefore, we should support people like them, and so take our share in their work for the truth.
23	OEB	3 John	1	9	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be the leader among them) doesn’t welcome us.
23	OEB	3 John	1	10	So if I come, I will bring up his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that, he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers, but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church.
23	OEB	3 John	1	11	Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.
23	OEB	3 John	1	12	Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say is true.
23	OEB	3 John	1	13	I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and ink.
23	OEB	3 John	1	14	I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face.

24	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to Titus	1	11	Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
24	DRB	The Epistle of St. Paul to Titus	1	12	One of them a prophet of their own, said: The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.

24	OEB	Titus	1	1	From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness
24	OEB	Titus	1	2	– and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,
24	OEB	Titus	1	3	and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.
24	OEB	Titus	1	4	To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace.
24	OEB	Titus	1	5	My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.
24	OEB	Titus	1	6	They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.
24	OEB	Titus	1	7	For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.
24	OEB	Titus	1	8	Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,
24	OEB	Titus	1	9	holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.
24	OEB	Titus	1	10	For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.
24	OEB	Titus	1	11	They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.
24	OEB	Titus	1	12	It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true.
24	OEB	Titus	1	13	Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
24	OEB	Titus	1	14	and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.
24	OEB	Titus	1	15	To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.
24	OEB	Titus	1	16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.
24	OEB	Titus	2	1	You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.
24	OEB	Titus	2	2	Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.
24	OEB	Titus	2	3	So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.
24	OEB	Titus	2	4	They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
24	OEB	Titus	2	5	and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.
24	OEB	Titus	2	6	In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.
24	OEB	Titus	2	7	In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –
24	OEB	Titus	2	8	let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.
24	OEB	Titus	2	9	Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
24	OEB	Titus	2	10	Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do.
24	OEB	Titus	2	11	For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,
24	OEB	Titus	2	12	leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,
24	OEB	Titus	2	13	while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.
24	OEB	Titus	2	14	For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.
24	OEB	Titus	2	15	Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.
24	OEB	Titus	3	1	Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,
24	OEB	Titus	3	2	to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.
24	OEB	Titus	3	3	There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.
24	OEB	Titus	3	4	But, when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,
24	OEB	Titus	3	5	not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,
24	OEB	Titus	3	6	which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior –
24	OEB	Titus	3	7	so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.
24	OEB	Titus	3	8	This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.
24	OEB	Titus	3	9	But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.
24	OEB	Titus	3	10	If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.
24	OEB	Titus	3	11	You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned.
24	OEB	Titus	3	12	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.
24	OEB	Titus	3	13	Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.
24	OEB	Titus	3	14	Let all our people learn to devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their lives may not be unfruitful.
24	OEB	Titus	3	15	All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting to our friends in the faith.
24	WEB	Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
24	WEB	Titus	1	2	in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;
24	WEB	Titus	1	3	but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
24	WEB	Titus	1	4	to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
24	WEB	Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;
24	WEB	Titus	1	6	if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.
24	WEB	Titus	1	7	For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
24	WEB	Titus	1	8	but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
24	WEB	Titus	1	9	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
24	WEB	Titus	1	10	For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
24	WEB	Titus	1	11	whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
24	WEB	Titus	1	12	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.
24	WEB	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
24	WEB	Titus	1	14	not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
24	WEB	Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
24	WEB	Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
24	WEB	Titus	2	1	But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
24	WEB	Titus	2	2	that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:
24	WEB	Titus	2	3	and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
24	WEB	Titus	2	4	that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
24	WEB	Titus	2	5	to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.
24	WEB	Titus	2	6	Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
24	WEB	Titus	2	7	in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
24	WEB	Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.
24	WEB	Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
24	WEB	Titus	2	10	not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
24	WEB	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
24	WEB	Titus	2	12	instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
24	WEB	Titus	2	13	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
24	WEB	Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.
24	WEB	Titus	2	15	Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
24	WEB	Titus	3	1	Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
24	WEB	Titus	3	2	to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
24	WEB	Titus	3	3	For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
24	WEB	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
24	WEB	Titus	3	5	not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
24	WEB	Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
24	WEB	Titus	3	7	that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
24	WEB	Titus	3	8	This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
24	WEB	Titus	3	9	but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
24	WEB	Titus	3	10	Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
24	WEB	Titus	3	11	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
24	WEB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
24	WEB	Titus	3	13	Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass: and signified, sending by his angel to his servant John, The things which must shortly come; ... and again it is said, ver. 3, The time is at hand.... This can not be meant of all the things prophesied in the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. That some things were to come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches, chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	3	8	I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	3	9	Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and adore before thy feet. And they shall know that I have loved thee.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	1	After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which must be done hereafter.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	2	And immediately I was in the spirit. And behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	3	And he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	4	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments. And on their heads were crowns of gold.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	5	And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	6	And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	7	And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	8	And the four living creatures had each of them six wings: and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	9	And when those living creatures gave glory and honour and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	10	The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne and adored him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	4	11	Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honour and power. Because thou hast created all things: and for thy will they were and have been created. Apocalypse Chapter 5 The book sealed with seven seals is opened by the Lamb, who thereupon receives adoration and praise from all.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	1	And I saw, in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book, written within and without, sealed with seven seals.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	2	And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	3	And no man was able, neither in heaven nor on earth nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	5	And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not: behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	6	And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing, as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	8	And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. The prayers of saints.... Here we see that the saints in heaven offer up to Christ the prayers of the faithful upon earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	9	And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book and to open the seals thereof: because thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	10	And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the ancients (and the number of them was thousands of thousands),
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	12	Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and benediction.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	13	And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb, benediction and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	5	14	And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces and adored him that liveth for ever and ever. Apocalypse Chapter 6 What followed upon opening six of the seals.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	1	And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals: and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of thunder, saying: Come and see.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	2	And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that he might conquer. White horse.... He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth to subdue the world by his gospel. The other horses that follow represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies of Christ and his church. The red horse signifies war; the black horse, famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or pestilence.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying: Come and see.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	4	And there went out another horse that was red. And to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth: and that they should kill one another. And a great sword was given to him.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying: Come and see. And behold a black horse. And he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	6	And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two pounds of barley for a penny: and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying: Come and see.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	8	And behold a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death. And hell followed him. And power was given to him over the four parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine and with death and with the beasts of the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. Under the altar.... Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls of the martyrs live in heaven, as their bodies are here deposited under our altars.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O Lord (Holy and True), dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? Revenge our blood.... They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies, but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his elect.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	11	And white robes were given to every one of them one; And it was said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow servants and their brethren, who are to be slain even as they, should be filled up.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	12	And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal: and behold there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair: and the whole moon became as blood.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	13	And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	14	And the heaven departed as a book folded up. And every mountain, and the islands, were moved out of their places.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	15	And the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the rich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of mountains:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	16	And they say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	6	17	For the great day of their wrath is come. And who shall be able to stand? Apocalypse Chapter 7 The number of them that were marked with the seal of the living God and clothed in white robes.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	1	After these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that they should not blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor on any tree.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the sign of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	3	Saying: Hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in their foreheads.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	4	And I heard the number of them that were signed. An hundred forty-four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the children of Israel.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	5	Of the tribe of Juda, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Ruben, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand signed:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	6	Of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Nephthali, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Manasses, twelve thousand signed:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	7	Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand signed:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	8	Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand signed.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	9	After this, I saw a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne and to the Lamb.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	11	And all the angels stood round about the throne and the ancients and the four living creatures. And they fell down before the throne upon their faces and adored God,
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	12	Saying: Amen. Benediction and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, honour and power and strength, to our God, for ever and ever. Amen.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	13	And one of the ancients answered and said to me: These that are clothed in white robes, who are they? And whence came they?
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	14	And I said to him: My Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me: These are they who are come out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	15	Therefore, they are before the throne of God: and they serve him day and night in his temple. And he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell over them.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	16	They shall no more hunger nor thirst: neither shall the sun fall on them, nor any heat.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	7	17	For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall rule them and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. Apocalypse Chapter 8 The seventh seal is opened. The angels with the seven trumpets.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven, as it were for half an hour.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	2	And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God: and there were given to them seven trumpets.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	3	And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer: and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer of the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the throne of God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	4	And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	5	And the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it on the earth: and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and a great earthquake.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpet.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	7	And the first angel sounded the trumpet: and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood: and it was cast on the earth. And the third part of the earth was burnt up: and the third part of the trees was burnt up: and all green grass was burnt up.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	8	And the second angel sounded the trumpet: and, as it were, a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	9	And the third part of those creatures died which had life in the sea: and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	10	And the third angel sounded the trumpet: and a great star fell from heaven, burning as it were a torch. And it fell on the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became wormwood. And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day did not shine for a third part of it: and the night in like manner.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	8	13	And I beheld: and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, Woe, Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the rest of the voices of the three angels, who are yet to sound the trumpet! Apocalypse Chapter 9 Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of horsemen.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	1	And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit. A star full.... This may mean the fall and apostasy of great and learned men from the true faith. Or a whole nation falling into error and separating from the church, not having the sign of God in their foreheads. And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit.... That is, to the angel, not to the fallen star. To this angel was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening hell.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit: and the smoke of the pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	3	And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. There came out locusts.... These may be devils in Antichrist’s time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of God on their foreheads. Some commentators by these locusts understand heretics, and especially those heretics, that sprung from Jews, and with them denied the divinity of Jesus Christ; as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, etc. These were great enemies of the Christian religion; they tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their heresies. Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make Abaddon the Pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists: besides, those who might be inposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	5	And it was given unto them that they should not kill them: but that they should torment them five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	6	And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die: and death shall fly from them.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle. And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold: and their faces were as the faces of men.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women: and their teeth were as lions.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	9	And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron: and the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	10	And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt men, five months. And they had over them
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	11	A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	12	One woe is past: and behold there come yet two woes more hereafter.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet: and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of God,
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	14	Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet: Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	15	And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third part of men.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	16	And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand. And I heard the number of them.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision. And they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions: and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	18	And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads: and with them they hurt.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	20	And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not adore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	9	21	Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts. Apocalypse Chapter 10 The cry of a mighty angel. He gives John a book to eat.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head: and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	2	And he had in his hand a little book, open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	3	And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken. And write them not.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	5	And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	6	And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things which are in it, and the sea and the things which are therein: That time shall be no longer.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the prophets. Declared.... literally evangelized, to signify the good tidings, agreeable to the Gospel, of the final victory of Christ, and of that eternal life, which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of the martyrs and faithful servants of God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	8	And I heard a voice from heaven, again speaking to me and saying: Go and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	10	9	And I went to the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book and eat it up. And it shall make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	2	But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles. And the holy city they shall tread under foot, two and forty months:

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry: and shall send gifts one to another, because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	16	And the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the sight of God, fell on their faces and adored God, saying:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	17	We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast and who art to come: because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and thou hast reigned.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	18	And the nations were angry: and thy wrath is come. And the time of the dead, that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints, and to them that fear thy name, little and great: and shouldest destroy them who have corrupted the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	11	19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven: and the ark of his testament was seen in his temple. And there were lightnings and voices and an earthquake and great hail. Apocalypse Chapter 12 The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon her persecutor.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	1	And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. A woman.... The church of God. It may also, by allusion, be applied to our blessed Lady. The church is clothed with the sun, that is, with Christ: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet: and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve apostles: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and Christ in them, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	7	And there was a great battle in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	8	And they prevailed not: neither was their place found any more in heaven.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	9	And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world. And he was cast unto the earth: and his angels were thrown down with him.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	16	And the earth helped the woman: and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	12	17	And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	1	And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns: and upon his horns, ten diadems: and upon his heads, names of blasphemy. A beast.... This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.: the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz., the empire of Rome: and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard: and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his own strength and great power.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	3	And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and his death’s wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration after the beast. One of his heads, etc.... Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the Apostate.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	4	And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast. And they adored the beast, saying: Who is like to the beast? And who shall be able to fight with him?
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	5	And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies: and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	6	And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven. His tabernacle, etc.... That is, his church and his saints.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And power was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	8	And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the beginning of the world. Slain from the beginning, etc.... In the foreknowledge of God; and inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view of his death and passion.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	9	If any man have an ear, let him hear.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	10	He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity: he that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	11	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had two horns, like a lamb: and he spoke as a dragon. Another beast.... This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	12	And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	13	And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down from heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	14	And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which had the wound by the sword and lived.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	15	And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast: and that the image of the beast should speak: and should cause that whosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	16	And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on their foreheads:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	17	And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	13	18	Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the number of him is six hundred sixty-six. Six hundred sixty-six.... The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number. Apocalypse Chapter 14 Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him. Of the judgments that shall fall upon the wicked.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	1	And I beheld: and lo a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters and as the voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	3	And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	4	These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	5	And in their mouth there was found no lie: for they are without spot before the throne of God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	6	And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over every nation and tribe and tongue and people:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	7	Saying with a loud voice: Fear the Lord and give him honour, because the hour of his judgment is come. And adore ye him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	8	And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Babylon.... By Babylon may be very probably signified all the wicked world in general, which God will punish, and destroy after the short time of this mortal life: or it may signify every great city wherein enormous sins and abominations are daily committed; and that when the measure of its iniquities is full, the punishments due to its crimes are poured on it. It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end of the world.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any man shall adore the beast and his image and receive his character in his forehead or in his hand,
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	10	He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath: and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	11	And the smoke of their torments, shall ascend up for ever and ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his name.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	12	Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me: Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours. For their works follow them. Die in the Lord.... It is understood of the martyrs who die for the Lord.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	14	And I saw: and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp sickle.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	15	And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap. For the harvest of the earth is ripe.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth: and the earth was reaped.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes thereof are ripe.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	19	And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	14	20	And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs. Apocalypse Chapter 15 They that have overcome the beast glorify God. Of the seven angels with the seven vials.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels having the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath of God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	3	And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the canticle of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, O King of ages.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	4	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name? For thou only art holy. For all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight, because thy judgments are manifest.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	5	And after these things, I looked: and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	6	And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts with golden girdles.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	7	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and from his power. And no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled. Apocalypse Chapter 16 The seven vials are poured out. The plagues that ensue.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	2	And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. And there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men who had the character of the beast: and upon them that adored the image thereof.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea. And there came blood as it were of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	4	And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of waters. And there was made blood.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art just, O Lord, who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets: and thou hast given them blood to drink. For they are worthy.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	7	And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun. And it was given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	9	And men were scorched with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues. Neither did they penance to give him glory.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast. And his kingdom became dark: and they gnawed their tongues for pain.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	11	And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and wounds: and did not penance for their works.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	13	And I saw from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	14	For they are the spirits of devils, working signs: and they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle against the great day of the Almighty God.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	16	And he shall gather them together into a place which in Hebrew is called Armagedon. Armagedon.... That is, the hill of robbers.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	18	And there were lightnings and voices and thunders: and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	19	And the great city was divided into three parts: and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	20	And every island fled away: and the mountains were not found.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	16	21	And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God, for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great. Apocalypse Chapter 17 The description of the great harlot and of the beast upon which she sits.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	1	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. And they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	3	And he took me away in spirit into the desert. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	4	And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	5	And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery: Babylon the great, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth. A mystery.... That is, a secret; because what follows of the name and title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense. Babylon.... Either the city of the devil in general; or, if this place be to be understood of any particular city, pagan Rome, which then and for three hundred years persecuted the church; and was the principal seat both of empire and idolatry.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I wondered, when I had seen her, with great admiration.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	7	And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	8	The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of the bottomless pit and go into destruction. And the inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not. The beast which thou sawest.... This beast which supports Babylon, may signify the power of the devil: which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of Christ, but shall again exert itself under Antichrist. The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See chap. 13.1, and below, ver. 10.) The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the devil, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	9	And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth: and they are seven kings.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	10	Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come: and when he is come, he must remain a short time.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	11	And the beast which was and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom: but shall receive power as kings, one hour after the beast. Ten kings.... Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the church of Christ: which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the justice of God for the punishment of Babylon. Some understand this of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of Rome.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	13	These have one design: and their strength and power they shall deliver to the beast.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	14	These shall fight with the Lamb. And the Lamb shall overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings: and they that are with him are called and elect and faithful.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	15	And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: These shall hate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with fire.

I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. I fell down before, etc.... St. Augustine (lib. 20, contra Faust, c. 21) is of opinion, that this angel appeared in so glorious a manner, that St. John took him to be God; and therefore would have given him divine honour had not the angel stopped him, by telling him he was but his fellow servant. St. Gregory (Hom. 8, in Evang.) rather thinks that the veneration offered by St. John, was not divine honour, or indeed any other than what might lawfully be given; but was nevertheless refused by the angel, in consideration of the dignity to which our human nature had been raised, by the incarnation of the Son of God, and the dignity of St. John, an apostle, prophet, and martyr.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	2	And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. Bound him, etc.... The power of Satan has been very much limited by the passion of Christ: for a thousand years; that is, for the whole time of the New Testament; but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome, till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the church, towards the end of the world. During which time the souls of the martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life of glory; as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of the general judgment.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection. In these the second death hath no power. But they shall be priests of God and of Christ: and shall reign with him a thousand years.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	20	7	And when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go forth and seduce the nations which are over the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog: and shall gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	21	17	And he measured the wall thereof an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is of an angel. The measure of a man, i.e., According to the measure of men, and used by the angel.... This seems to be the true meaning of these words.

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	21	19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper: the second, sapphire: the third; a chalcedony: the fourth, an emerald:

25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	10	And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book. For the time is at hand. For the time is at hand.... That is, when compared to eternity, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the 4th chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the end of the world. Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned Bossnet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned men. In fine, others think that St. John’s design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general: the eternal happiness and reward, which God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no certainty when we apply these predictions to particular events: for as St. Jerome takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word. Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot verba—parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiae. Ep. ad Paulin, t. 4. p. 574. Edit. Benedict.
25	DRB	The Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle	22	11	He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is just, let him be justified still: and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still. Let him hurt still.... It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in sin; but an intimation, that how far soever the wicked may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments.

APPENDICES These texts come from the 1582 Rhemes and 1610 Doway printings of the portions of the Bible. The primary sources provide a glimpse both into the history of the Douay-Rheims version and the English language itself. The reader will quickly notice that the letter ‘j’ does not appear in the texts, rather ‘i’ functions either as a vowel or a consonant. Likewise ‘u’ is not a distinct letter; it is employed typographically in the lower-case in place of ‘v’ where not starting a word. The letters ‘u’ and ‘v’ both function either as vowels or consonants. The word ‘vniuersity’ demonstrates this rule. The letter ‘w’ is often employed, but in many cases the earlier form of a double-v (vv) appears instead. The transcriber has done his best to render the text accurately. Note the relaxed spelling standards of the time; many variants appear. While the errata section from the 1610 edition observed: “We haue also found some other faultes of lesse importance; and feare there be more. But we trust the reader may easely correct them, as they occurre.” only obvious errors have been amended. Where the transcriber has doubt between whether an irregular spelling is either an error and a variant, the printed text stands. 7-bit ASCII cannot fully represent the typographical standards of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and many special characters have been replaced with modern equivalents. Where verse numbers stand in the margins of the printed texts, they

25	OEB	Revelation	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,
25	OEB	Revelation	1	2	who testified to the message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for the time is near.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	4	From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
25	OEB	Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood –
25	OEB	Revelation	1	6	and he made us a kingdom of priests in the service of God, his Father! – to him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	7	He is coming among the clouds! Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. So will it be. Amen.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	8	‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’  says the Lord,  the God who is, and who was, and who will be, the Almighty.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	9	I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	10	I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	11	It said –  ‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.’
25	OEB	Revelation	1	12	I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,
25	OEB	Revelation	1	13	and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	14	The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;
25	OEB	Revelation	1	15	and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams,
25	OEB	Revelation	1	16	in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	17	And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said –  ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,
25	OEB	Revelation	1	18	the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and of Hades.
25	OEB	Revelation	1	19	Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place –
25	OEB	Revelation	1	20	the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven churches.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	1	“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write
25	OEB	Revelation	2	2	I know your life, your toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers. I know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are apostles, though they are not, and how you proved them false.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	3	You possess endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	4	But this I have against you – You have abandoned your first love.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	5	Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp from its place, unless you repent.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	6	But this is in your favor – You hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	7	Anyone with ears should hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him who conquers – to him I will give the right to eat the fruit of the Tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	8	“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:
25	OEB	Revelation	2	9	I know your persecution and your poverty – yet you are rich! I know, too, the slander that comes from those who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 2:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are a congregation of Satan.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	10	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	11	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Those who conquer will suffer no hurt from the Second Death.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	12	“To the angel of the church in Pergamus write:
25	OEB	Revelation	2	13	I know where you live, where the throne of Satan stands. And yet you hold to my name, and you did not disown my faith even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death among you where Satan dwells.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	14	Yet I have a few things against you – You have among you those who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit licentious acts.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	15	Again you have among you those who hold in the same way to the teaching of the Nikolaitans.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	16	Therefore repent, or else, I will come quickly and contend with such people with words that will cut like a sword.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	17	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To those who conquer – to them I will give a share of the mystic manna, and I will give them a white stone; and on the stone will be inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the person who receives it.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	18	“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:
25	OEB	Revelation	2	19	I know your life, your love, faith, service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been better than it was at first.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	20	Yet I have this against you – You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat idol-offerings.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	21	I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to turn from her licentiousness.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	22	Therefore I am laying her on a bed of sickness, and bringing great suffering on those who are unfaithful with her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	23	I will also put her children to death; and all the churches will learn that I am he who looks into people’s hearts and souls; and I will give to each one of you what their life deserves.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	24	But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira – all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn the secrets of Satan, as people call them – I am not laying on you any further burden;
25	OEB	Revelation	2	25	only hold fast to what you have received, until I come.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	26	To those who conquer and are careful to live my life to the end – to them I will give authority over the nations,
25	OEB	Revelation	2	27	and they will rule them with an iron rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces (as I myself have received from my Father)
25	OEB	Revelation	2	28	and I will give them the morning star.
25	OEB	Revelation	2	29	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	1	“To the angel of the church in Sardis write:
25	OEB	Revelation	3	2	Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	3	Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I am coming to you.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	4	Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	5	Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes, and I will not strike their name out of the book of life; but I will own them before my Father, and before his angels.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	6	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	7	“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
25	OEB	Revelation	3	8	I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	9	Listen, I give some of the congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are God’s people,  ^[ 3:9 God’s people: Literally ‘Jews.’ These people claimed to be God’s people because they were Jews.] though they are not, but are lying – I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will learn that I loved you.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	10	Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	11	I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may take your crown.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	12	Those who conquer – I will make them a pillar in the Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will write on them my new name.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	13	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	14	“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
25	OEB	Revelation	3	15	I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot!
25	OEB	Revelation	3	16	But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	17	You say ‘I am rich and have grown rich, and I want for nothing,’ and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked!
25	OEB	Revelation	3	18	Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	19	All whom I love I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	20	I am standing at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	21	To those who conquer – to them I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, as I, when I conquered, took my seat beside my Father on his throne.
25	OEB	Revelation	3	22	Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”
25	OEB	Revelation	4	1	After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’
25	OEB	Revelation	4	2	Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.
25	OEB	Revelation	4	3	He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and around the throne there was a rainbow of the color of an emerald.
25	OEB	Revelation	4	4	And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.
25	OEB	Revelation	4	5	Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;
25	OEB	Revelation	4	6	and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
25	OEB	Revelation	4	7	The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.
25	OEB	Revelation	4	8	These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say –
25	OEB	Revelation	4	9	And, whenever these creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,
25	OEB	Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying –
25	OEB	Revelation	4	11	‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’
25	OEB	Revelation	5	1	Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;
25	OEB	Revelation	5	2	and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’
25	OEB	Revelation	5	3	But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.
25	OEB	Revelation	5	4	At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.
25	OEB	Revelation	5	5	But one of the elders said to me – ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’
25	OEB	Revelation	5	6	Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)
25	OEB	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
25	OEB	Revelation	5	8	And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)
25	OEB	Revelation	5	9	And they are singing a new song –
25	OEB	Revelation	5	10	and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’
25	OEB	Revelation	5	11	Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,
25	OEB	Revelation	5	12	and they cried in a loud voice –
25	OEB	Revelation	5	13	And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying –
25	OEB	Revelation	5	14	And the four creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	1	Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – ‘Come.’
25	OEB	Revelation	6	2	And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – ‘Come.’
25	OEB	Revelation	6	4	Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	5	When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	6	And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’
25	OEB	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – ‘Come.’
25	OEB	Revelation	6	8	And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	10	They cried in a loud voice – ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’
25	OEB	Revelation	6	11	Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	12	And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	13	The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	14	The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
25	OEB	Revelation	6	15	Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;
25	OEB	Revelation	6	16	and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
25	OEB	Revelation	6	17	for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’
25	OEB	Revelation	7	1	After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.
25	OEB	Revelation	7	2	And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –
25	OEB	Revelation	7	3	‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’
25	OEB	Revelation	7	4	I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.
25	OEB	Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,
25	OEB	Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,
25	OEB	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,
25	OEB	Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand,
25	OEB	Revelation	7	9	After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.
25	OEB	Revelation	7	10	And they are crying in a loud voice –
25	OEB	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,
25	OEB	Revelation	7	12	saying –
25	OEB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’
25	OEB	Revelation	7	14	‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’
25	OEB	Revelation	7	15	And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.
25	OEB	Revelation	7	16	Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;
25	OEB	Revelation	7	17	for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’
25	OEB	Revelation	8	1	As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	3	Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	7	The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	8	Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
25	OEB	Revelation	8	9	and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	10	Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	11	(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.
25	OEB	Revelation	8	13	And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’
25	OEB	Revelation	9	1	Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	3	Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	5	Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	6	In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	7	In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,
25	OEB	Revelation	9	8	and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,
25	OEB	Revelation	9	9	and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	10	They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	11	They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer).
25	OEB	Revelation	9	12	The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!
25	OEB	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	14	It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’
25	OEB	Revelation	9	15	Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	16	The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	17	And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulfur.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	18	Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur that issued from their mouths;
25	OEB	Revelation	9	19	for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.
25	OEB	Revelation	9	20	But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
25	OEB	Revelation	9	21	and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.
25	OEB	Revelation	10	1	Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
25	OEB	Revelation	10	2	in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;
25	OEB	Revelation	10	3	and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.
25	OEB	Revelation	10	4	And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’
25	OEB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,
25	OEB	Revelation	10	6	and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.
25	OEB	Revelation	10	7	Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.
25	OEB	Revelation	10	8	Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – ‘Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.’
25	OEB	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said ‘Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’
25	OEB	Revelation	10	10	I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.
25	OEB	Revelation	10	11	And I was told – ‘You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.’
25	OEB	Revelation	11	1	Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	2	But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	3	Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’
25	OEB	Revelation	11	4	These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	5	When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	6	These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	7	As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	8	Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	9	People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	10	Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	11	After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	12	The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	13	At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.
25	OEB	Revelation	11	14	The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!
25	OEB	Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying –
25	OEB	Revelation	11	16	At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped him,
25	OEB	Revelation	11	17	saying –
25	OEB	Revelation	11	18	The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’
25	OEB	Revelation	11	19	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	1	Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	3	Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	4	His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	5	The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	6	But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	7	Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,
25	OEB	Revelation	12	8	he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	9	Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said –
25	OEB	Revelation	12	11	Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	12	Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’
25	OEB	Revelation	12	13	When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	14	But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	15	Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	16	But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.
25	OEB	Revelation	12	17	The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;
25	OEB	Revelation	12	18	and he took his stand on the sea-shore.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	1	Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	2	The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	3	One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;
25	OEB	Revelation	13	4	and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – ‘Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?’
25	OEB	Revelation	13	5	The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	7	It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	8	All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	9	Let those who have ears hear.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	10	Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.)
25	OEB	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	12	It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	13	It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;
25	OEB	Revelation	13	14	and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honor of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	15	It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	16	High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,
25	OEB	Revelation	13	17	so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.
25	OEB	Revelation	13	18	(Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	1	Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	3	They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	4	These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	5	No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;
25	OEB	Revelation	14	7	and he cried in a loud voice – ‘Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	8	Then a second angel followed, crying – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	9	Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – ‘Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,
25	OEB	Revelation	14	10	that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulfur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	11	The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	12	(Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)
25	OEB	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.”’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	14	Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – ‘Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	16	He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	18	Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – ‘Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.’
25	OEB	Revelation	14	19	The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
25	OEB	Revelation	14	20	The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.
25	OEB	Revelation	15	1	Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvelous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.
25	OEB	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.
25	OEB	Revelation	15	3	They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb –
25	OEB	Revelation	15	4	Who will not honor and praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest.’
25	OEB	Revelation	15	5	After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,
25	OEB	Revelation	15	6	and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.
25	OEB	Revelation	15	7	One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.
25	OEB	Revelation	15	8	The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’
25	OEB	Revelation	16	2	The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	3	Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	4	Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;
25	OEB	Revelation	16	6	for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’
25	OEB	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the response from the altar – ‘Yes, Lord, our God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments.’
25	OEB	Revelation	16	8	Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;
25	OEB	Revelation	16	9	and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	10	Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,
25	OEB	Revelation	16	11	and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	12	Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	13	And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	14	They are the spirits of demons, and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	15	(‘I am coming like a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see his nakedness.’)
25	OEB	Revelation	16	16	And the spirits collected the kings at the place called in Hebrew ‘Har-Magedon.’
25	OEB	Revelation	16	17	Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice came from the throne in the Temple; it said ‘All is over.’)
25	OEB	Revelation	16	18	There followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be on the earth – none so great;
25	OEB	Revelation	16	19	and the great city was torn in three, and the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath;
25	OEB	Revelation	16	20	and every island vanished, and the mountains disappeared.
25	OEB	Revelation	16	21	Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	1	Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the sentence passed on that Great Harlot who is seated at the meeting of many waters,
25	OEB	Revelation	17	2	and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.’
25	OEB	Revelation	17	3	And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;
25	OEB	Revelation	17	5	while on her forehead there was written this mystic name – ‘BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ALL IDOLATROUS ABOMINATIONS ON EARTH.’
25	OEB	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;
25	OEB	Revelation	17	7	but the angel said to me – ‘Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	8	The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.’
25	OEB	Revelation	17	9	(Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	10	They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	11	So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	13	These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	14	They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	15	And the angel said to me – ‘The waters that you saw, where the Harlot is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns that you saw, and the Beast – they will hate the Harlot, and cause her to become deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	17	For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their kingdoms to the Beast, until God’s decrees will be executed.
25	OEB	Revelation	17	18	As for the woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the kings of the earth.’
25	OEB	Revelation	18	1	After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	2	With a mighty voice he cried – “She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	3	For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying – “Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	5	For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	6	Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;
25	OEB	Revelation	18	7	for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’
25	OEB	Revelation	18	8	Therefore in one day will these curses strike her – death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	9	All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,
25	OEB	Revelation	18	10	while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry – “Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour your judgment fell.”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes –
25	OEB	Revelation	18	12	their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;
25	OEB	Revelation	18	13	nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	14	The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	15	The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying –
25	OEB	Revelation	18	16	“Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments, and precious stones, and pearls!
25	OEB	Revelation	18	17	In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.” Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,
25	OEB	Revelation	18	18	and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried – “What city can compare with the Great city?”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	19	They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – “Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!
25	OEB	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying – “So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.
25	OEB	Revelation	18	22	No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;
25	OEB	Revelation	18	23	no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.”
25	OEB	Revelation	18	24	Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	1	After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying –
25	OEB	Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	3	Again they cried – ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	4	Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;
25	OEB	Revelation	19	5	and from the throne there came a voice which said –
25	OEB	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying –
25	OEB	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honor, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	8	And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	9	Then a voice said to me ‘Write – “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said – ‘These words of God are true.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	10	I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	11	Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	12	His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;
25	OEB	Revelation	19	13	he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	15	From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;
25	OEB	Revelation	19	16	and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,
25	OEB	Revelation	19	18	to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’
25	OEB	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	20	The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulfur.
25	OEB	Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	2	He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	3	He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	5	(The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his prison,
25	OEB	Revelation	20	8	and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	9	They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;
25	OEB	Revelation	20	10	and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.
25	OEB	Revelation	20	14	Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;
25	OEB	Revelation	20	15	and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	1	Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	2	And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,
25	OEB	Revelation	21	4	and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’
25	OEB	Revelation	21	5	And he who was seated on the throne said – ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said – ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’
25	OEB	Revelation	21	6	And he said to me – ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	7	Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	8	But as for cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars – their place will be in the burning lake of fire and sulfur. That is the Second Death.’
25	OEB	Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’
25	OEB	Revelation	21	10	He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	11	Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	12	It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	13	There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	14	The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	15	And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	16	The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	17	Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	18	The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	19	The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;
25	OEB	Revelation	21	20	the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	22	And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	23	The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	24	The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	25	Its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	26	And people will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
25	OEB	Revelation	21	27	Never will any unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	1	And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
25	OEB	Revelation	22	2	in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	3	Every thing that is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;
25	OEB	Revelation	22	4	they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	5	Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	6	Then the angel said to me – “These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;
25	OEB	Revelation	22	7	and they said  ‘I will come quickly.’  Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.”
25	OEB	Revelation	22	8	It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	9	But he said to me – “Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.”
25	OEB	Revelation	22	10	Then the angel said to me – “Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	11	Let the wrongdoer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to be holy.”
25	OEB	Revelation	22	12	(‘I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to each what their actions deserve.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	13	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the End.’)
25	OEB	Revelation	22	14	Blessed will they be who wash their robes! They will have the right to approach the Tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	15	Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	16	‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these things before the churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David, the bright star of the Morning.’
25	OEB	Revelation	22	17	‘Come,’ say the Spirit and the Bride; and all who hear, say ‘Come.’ All who thirst, come; anyone who wants, take the water of life freely.
25	OEB	Revelation	22	18	I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in this book – ‘If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the curses described in this book;
25	OEB	Revelation	22	19	and if anyone takes away any of the words in the book containing this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of life, and in the Holy City – as described in this book.’
25	OEB	Revelation	22	20	He whose testimony this is says –  ‘Assuredly I will come quickly.’  ‘Amen, come, Lord Jesus.’

25	WEB	Revelation	1	12	I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.  Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.
25	WEB	Revelation	1	13	And among the lampstands was one like a son of man,{Daniel 7:13} clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.
25	WEB	Revelation	1	14	His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.

25	WEB	Revelation	1	16	He had seven stars in his right hand.  Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.  His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
25	WEB	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, Don't be afraid. I am the first and the last,
25	WEB	Revelation	1	18	and the Living one.  I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.  Amen.  I have the keys of Death and of Hades{or, Hell}.

25	WEB	Revelation	1	20	the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands.  The seven stars are the angels{or, messengers (here and wherever angels are mentioned)} of the seven assemblies.  The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.

25	WEB	Revelation	2	2	I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you can't tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	3	You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have{TR adds have labored and} not grown weary.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	4	But I have this against you, that you left your first love.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	5	Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	6	But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	7	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.  To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	8	To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:
25	WEB	Revelation	2	9	I know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	10	Don't be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	11	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.  He who overcomes won't be harmed by the second death.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	12	To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write: He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:
25	WEB	Revelation	2	13	I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	15	So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise{TR reads which I hate instead of likewise}.

25	WEB	Revelation	2	17	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.

25	WEB	Revelation	2	18	To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:
25	WEB	Revelation	2	19	I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	20	But I have this against you, that you tolerate your{TR, NU read that instead of your} woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.

25	WEB	Revelation	2	22	Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	23	I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
25	WEB	Revelation	2	24	But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don't have this teaching, who don't know what some call 'the deep things of Satan,' to you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you.

25	WEB	Revelation	3	1	And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write:  He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things: I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	2	Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you were about to throw away, for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	3	Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent.  If therefore you won't watch, I will come as a thief, and you won't know what hour I will come upon you.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	4	Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments.  They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	5	He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

25	WEB	Revelation	3	9	Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie.  Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	10	Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	11	I am coming quickly!  Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	12	He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more.  I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	13	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	14	To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write:  The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God's creation, says these things:
25	WEB	Revelation	3	15	I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	16	So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my mouth.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	17	Because you say, 'I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing;' and don't know that you are the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;
25	WEB	Revelation	3	18	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	19	As many as I love, I reprove and chasten.  Be zealous therefore, and repent.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	20	Behold, I stand at the door and knock.  If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	21	He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
25	WEB	Revelation	3	22	He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	1	After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	2	Immediately I was in the Spirit.  Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne
25	WEB	Revelation	4	3	that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius.  There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	4	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones.  On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	5	Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	6	Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal.  In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	7	The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
25	WEB	Revelation	4	8	The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around about and within.  They have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy{Hodges/Farstad MT reads holy 9 times instead of 3.} is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!
25	WEB	Revelation	4	9	When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,
25	WEB	Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,
25	WEB	Revelation	4	11	Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,{TR omits and God, the Holy One,} to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!
25	WEB	Revelation	5	1	I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	2	I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?
25	WEB	Revelation	5	3	No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	4	And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	5	One of the elders said to me, Don't weep.  Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	6	I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	7	Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	8	Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	9	They sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals:  for you were killed, and bought us for God with your blood, out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,
25	WEB	Revelation	5	10	and made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign on earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	5	11	I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;
25	WEB	Revelation	5	12	saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!
25	WEB	Revelation	5	13	I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!{TR omits Amen!}
25	WEB	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said, Amen!  The {TR adds twenty-four}elders fell down and worshiped.{TR adds the one living forever and ever}
25	WEB	Revelation	6	1	I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come and see!
25	WEB	Revelation	6	2	And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	3	When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come!
25	WEB	Revelation	6	4	Another came forth, a red horse.  To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another.  There was given to him a great sword.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	5	When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see!  And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	6	I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix{A choenix is a dry volume measure that is a little more than a litre (a little more than a quart).} of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't damage the oil and the wine!
25	WEB	Revelation	6	7	When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, Come and see!
25	WEB	Revelation	6	8	And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was Death.  Hades{or, Hell} followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	9	When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	10	They cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
25	WEB	Revelation	6	11	A long white robe was given to each of them.  They were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	12	I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake.  The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	13	The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	14	The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	15	The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.
25	WEB	Revelation	6	16	They told the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
25	WEB	Revelation	6	17	for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?
25	WEB	Revelation	7	1	After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	2	I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God.  He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,
25	WEB	Revelation	7	3	saying, Don't harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!
25	WEB	Revelation	7	4	I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:
25	WEB	Revelation	7	5	of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
25	WEB	Revelation	7	6	of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
25	WEB	Revelation	7	7	of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
25	WEB	Revelation	7	8	of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	9	After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	10	They cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!
25	WEB	Revelation	7	11	All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,
25	WEB	Revelation	7	12	saying, Amen!  Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever!  Amen.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	13	One of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?
25	WEB	Revelation	7	14	I told him, My lord, you know.  He said to me, These are those who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's blood.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	15	Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple.  He who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.
25	WEB	Revelation	7	16	They will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;
25	WEB	Revelation	7	17	for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life.  And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	1	When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	2	I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	5	The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth.  There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	6	The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	7	The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up,{TR omits One third of the earth was burnt up} and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	8	The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea.  One third of the sea became blood,
25	WEB	Revelation	8	9	and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	10	The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star is called Wormwood. One third of the waters became wormwood.  Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.
25	WEB	Revelation	8	13	I saw, and I heard an eagle,{TR reads angel instead of eagle} flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe!  Woe!  Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!
25	WEB	Revelation	9	1	The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth.  The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	2	He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a{TR adds great} burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	4	They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don't have God's seal on their foreheads.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	5	They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months.  Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	6	In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	7	The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people's faces.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	8	They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	9	They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	10	They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	11	They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon,{Abaddon is a Hebrew word that means ruin, destruction, or the place of destruction} but in Greek, he has the name Apollyon.{Apollyon means Destroyer.}
25	WEB	Revelation	9	12	The first woe is past.  Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel sounded.  I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,
25	WEB	Revelation	9	14	saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!
25	WEB	Revelation	9	15	The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	16	The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million{literally, ten thousands of ten thousands}. I heard the number of them.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	17	Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions.  Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.
25	WEB	Revelation	9	21	They didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,{The word for sorceries (pharmakeia) also implies the use of potions, poisons, and drugs} nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	1	I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud.  A rainbow was on his head.  His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	2	He had in his hand a little open book.  He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	3	He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars.  When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	4	When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don't write them.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	5	The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,
25	WEB	Revelation	10	6	and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,
25	WEB	Revelation	10	7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	8	The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	9	I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. He said to me, Take it, and eat it up.  It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	10	I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth.  When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
25	WEB	Revelation	10	11	They told me, You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	1	A reed like a rod was given to me.  Someone said, Rise, and measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	2	Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don't measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	3	I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	5	If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies.  If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	6	These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy.  They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	7	When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	8	Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	9	From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	10	Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad.  They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	11	After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	12	I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here! They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	13	In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell.  Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	14	The second woe is past.  Behold, the third woe comes quickly.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ.  He will reign forever and ever!
25	WEB	Revelation	11	16	The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God's throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
25	WEB	Revelation	11	17	saying:  We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was{TR adds and who is coming}; because you have taken your great power, and reigned.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	18	The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	11	19	God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the Lord's covenant was seen in his temple.  Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	1	A great sign was seen in heaven:  a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	2	She was with child.  She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	3	Another sign was seen in heaven.  Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	4	His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth.  The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron.  Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	6	The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	7	There was war in the sky.  Michael and his angels made war on the dragon.  The dragon and his angels made war.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	8	They didn't prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	9	The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	10	I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	11	They overcame him because of the Lamb's blood, and because of the word of their testimony.  They didn't love their life, even to death.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	14	Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	15	The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	16	The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.
25	WEB	Revelation	12	17	The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep God's commandments and hold Jesus' testimony.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	1	Then I stood on the sand of the sea.  I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	2	The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	3	One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	4	They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?
25	WEB	Revelation	13	5	A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	6	He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	7	It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them.  Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	8	All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	10	If anyone has captivity, he will go.  If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed.{TR reads If anyone leads into captivity, into captivity he goes.  If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with a sword.  instead of If anyone has captivity, he goes away.  If anyone is with the sword, he must be killed.} Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	11	I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	12	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	13	He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	14	He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	15	It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast to be killed.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	16	He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads;
25	WEB	Revelation	13	17	and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
25	WEB	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom.  He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	1	I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	2	I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder.  The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	3	They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders.  No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	4	These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins.  These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	5	In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.{TR adds before the throne of God}
25	WEB	Revelation	14	6	I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	7	He said with a loud voice, Fear the Lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come.  Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!
25	WEB	Revelation	14	8	Another, a second angel, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	9	Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
25	WEB	Revelation	14	10	he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	11	The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	12	Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	13	I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'  Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	14	I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man,{Daniel 7:13} having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	15	Another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Send forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!
25	WEB	Revelation	14	16	He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	18	Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's grapes are fully ripe!
25	WEB	Revelation	14	19	The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
25	WEB	Revelation	14	20	The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.{1600 stadia = 296 kilometers or 184 miles}
25	WEB	Revelation	15	1	I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is finished.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	2	I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image,{TR adds his mark,} and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	3	They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the Almighty!  Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	4	Who wouldn't fear you, Lord, and glorify your name?  For you only are holy.  For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your righteous acts have been revealed.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	5	After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	6	The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	7	One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
25	WEB	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power.  No one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	1	I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!
25	WEB	Revelation	16	2	The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man.  Every living thing in the sea died.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	4	The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	5	I heard the angel of the waters saying, You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have judged these things.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	6	For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink.  They deserve this.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	7	I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	8	The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	9	People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn't repent and give him glory.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	10	The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened.  They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,
25	WEB	Revelation	16	11	and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores.  They didn't repent of their works.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	12	The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	13	I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;
25	WEB	Revelation	16	14	for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	15	Behold, I come like a thief.  Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked, and they see his shame.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	16	He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, Megiddo.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	17	The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done!
25	WEB	Revelation	16	18	There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	19	The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell.  Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	20	Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
25	WEB	Revelation	16	21	Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent,{1 talent is about 34 kilograms or 75 pounds} came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	1	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here.  I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,
25	WEB	Revelation	17	2	with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	3	He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	5	And on her forehead a name was written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	6	I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	7	The angel said to me, Why do you wonder?  I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.{TR reads yet is instead of shall be present}
25	WEB	Revelation	17	9	Here is the mind that has wisdom.  The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	10	They are seven kings.  Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come.  When he comes, he must continue a little while.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	11	The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	14	These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.  They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	15	He said to me, The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	17	For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.
25	WEB	Revelation	17	18	The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	1	After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority.  The earth was illuminated with his glory.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	2	He cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!
25	WEB	Revelation	18	3	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	4	I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don't receive of her plagues,
25	WEB	Revelation	18	5	for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	6	Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works.  In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	7	However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning.  For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'
25	WEB	Revelation	18	8	Therefore in one day her plagues will come:  death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	9	The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,
25	WEB	Revelation	18	10	standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.'
25	WEB	Revelation	18	11	The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more;
25	WEB	Revelation	18	12	merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
25	WEB	Revelation	18	13	and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people's bodies and souls.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	14	The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
25	WEB	Revelation	18	16	saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!
25	WEB	Revelation	18	17	For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.' Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,
25	WEB	Revelation	18	18	and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like the great city?'
25	WEB	Revelation	18	19	They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!' For in one hour is she made desolate.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	21	A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	22	The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you.  No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
25	WEB	Revelation	18	24	In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	1	After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah!  Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God:
25	WEB	Revelation	19	2	for true and righteous are his judgments.  For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

25	WEB	Revelation	19	4	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Amen!  Hallelujah!
25	WEB	Revelation	19	5	A voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!
25	WEB	Revelation	19	6	I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!  For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!
25	WEB	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him.  For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	8	It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen:  for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	9	He said to me, Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'  He said to me, These are true words of God.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	10	I fell down before his feet to worship him.  He said to me, Look!  Don't do it!  I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	11	I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war.

25	WEB	Revelation	19	18	that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	19	I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	20	The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
25	WEB	Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	1	I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	2	He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,
25	WEB	Revelation	20	3	and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished.  After this, he must be freed for a short time.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	4	I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them.  I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image, and didn't receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived, and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	5	The rest of the dead didn't live until the thousand years were finished.  This is the first resurrection.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	7	And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,
25	WEB	Revelation	20	8	and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	9	They went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city.  Fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	10	The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

25	WEB	Revelation	20	12	I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books.  Another book was opened, which is the book of life.  The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades{or, Hell} gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	14	Death and Hades{or, Hell} were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
25	WEB	Revelation	20	15	If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	1	I saw a new heaven and a new earth:  for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	2	I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband.

25	WEB	Revelation	21	6	He said to me, It is done!  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.  I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	7	He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	8	But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers,{The word for sorcerers here also includes users of potions and drugs.} idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	9	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, Come here.  I will show you the wife, the Lamb's bride.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	10	He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
25	WEB	Revelation	21	11	having the glory of God.  Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
25	WEB	Revelation	21	12	having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.

25	WEB	Revelation	21	14	The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	15	He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	16	The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia{12,012 stadia = or 2,221 kilometers or 1,380 miles. TR reads 12,000 stadia instead of 12,012 stadia.}. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	17	Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits,{144 cubits is about 65.8 meters or 216 feet} by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	18	The construction of its wall was jasper.  The city was pure gold, like pure glass.

25	WEB	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls.  Each one of the gates was made of one pearl.  The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	22	I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	23	The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	24	The nations will walk in its light.  The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	25	Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),
25	WEB	Revelation	21	26	and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter.
25	WEB	Revelation	21	27	There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	1	He showed me a{TR adds pure} river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,
25	WEB	Revelation	22	2	in the middle of its street.  On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month.  The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	3	There will be no curse any more.  The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.

25	WEB	Revelation	22	7	Behold, I come quickly.  Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	8	Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	9	He said to me, See you don't do it!  I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book.  Worship God.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	10	He said to me, Don't seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	11	He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still.  He who is righteous, let him do righteousness still.  He who is holy, let him be holy still.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	12	Behold, I come quickly.  My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work.

25	WEB	Revelation	22	18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him the plagues which are written in this book.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	19	If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
25	WEB	Revelation	22	20	He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly. Amen!  Yes, come, Lord Jesus.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™  Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
