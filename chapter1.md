## Methods and Data 

### Method 

### Data
The data was extracted from the official website for the Hansard of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. "Hansard is a substantially verbatim report - with repetitions and redundancies omitted and obvious mistakes corrected - or parliamentary proceedings" https://www.parliament.gov.za/hansard?sorts[language]=-1&page=5&offset=40. It constitutes the transcripts of the mini plenary sessions of the National Assembly, the National Council of Provinces, the National Assembly, and any joint sessions. The National Assembly is formed by 400 members from the various South African political parties. The National Assembly is elected by the voting population of South Africa. The National Council of Provinces is formed with 90 provincial delegates which translates to 10 delegates for each province. It is thus composed regardless of population distribution. The National Council of Provinces is chosen by the provincial governments/legislatures. 

The reports are majoritatively held in English, though when a speaker chooses to use another official language, it is transcribed ad verbatim and the English translation is given. The decision was made to process all reports of 2019 from the National Assembly. The data thus excludes any other years, all joint sittings, all meetings of the NCoP and all mini plenary sessions. 2019 was chosen as it constituted an election year, thus giving the opportunity of potentially harnessing more speakers as the National Assembly's composition was altered after elections. Furthermore, as the NA is the largest body in Parliament, it was chosen to again maximise speaker count. 

In total 51 sessions were held.
