The Second Book of Samuel	16:2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Zib
The Second Book of Samuel	16:3	And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba sai
The Second Book of Samuel	16:4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertaine
The Second Book of Samuel	16:5	And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out 
The Second Book of Samuel	16:6	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of kin
The Second Book of Samuel	16:7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, tho
The Second Book of Samuel	16:9	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why shoul

The First Book of the Kings	9:14	And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold
The First Book of the Kings	9:15	And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; fo
The First Book of the Kings	9:16	For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burn

The First Book of the Kings	9:23	These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’

The First Book of the Kings	10:3	And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thin
The First Book of the Kings	10:4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, an
The First Book of the Kings	10:6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard i
The First Book of the Kings	10:7	Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes ha

The First Book of the Kings	10:11	And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir
The First Book of the Kings	10:12	And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house o

The First Book of the Kings	10:14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was si
The First Book of the Kings	10:16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: si
The First Book of the Kings	10:17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound o
The First Book of the Kings	10:18	Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid i
The First Book of the Kings	10:19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was roun

The First Book of the Kings	10:22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy o
The First Book of the Kings	10:23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riche
The First Book of the Kings	10:24	And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, whic
The First Book of the Kings	10:25	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, an
The First Book of the Kings	10:26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he ha

The First Book of the Kings	11:3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundre
The First Book of the Kings	11:4	For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turne
The First Book of the Kings	11:5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians
The First Book of the Kings	11:6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not full
The First Book of the Kings	11:7	Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abominatio
The First Book of the Kings	11:8	And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burn
The First Book of the Kings	11:9	And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turne
The First Book of the Kings	11:11	Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is don

The First Book of the Kings	11:22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me
The First Book of the Kings	11:23	And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son o
The First Book of the Kings	11:25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon
The First Book of the Kings	11:26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda
The First Book of the Kings	11:27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against th
The First Book of the Kings	11:28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomo
The First Book of the Kings	11:29	And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out o
The First Book of the Kings	11:34	Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but 
The First Book of the Kings	11:35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will giv
The First Book of the Kings	11:36	And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servan

The First Book of the Kings	11:38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I comman
The First Book of the Kings	11:39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever
The First Book of the Kings	11:40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose

The First Book of the Kings	11:42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israe
The First Book of the Kings	11:43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the cit
The First Book of the Kings	12:1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Sheche
The First Book of the Kings	12:2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was ye
The First Book of the Kings	12:5	And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come agai
The First Book of the Kings	12:6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood befor
The First Book of the Kings	12:8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had give
The First Book of the Kings	12:11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I wil
The First Book of the Kings	12:12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day
The First Book of the Kings	12:13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the ol
The First Book of the Kings	12:15	Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the caus
The First Book of the Kings	12:16	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them
The First Book of the Kings	12:17	But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities o
The First Book of the Kings	12:18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; an
The First Book of the Kings	12:19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day
The First Book of the Kings	12:20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam wa
The First Book of the Kings	12:21	And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all th
The First Book of the Kings	12:22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying
The First Book of the Kings	12:23	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unt
The First Book of the Kings	12:25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein
The First Book of the Kings	12:26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return t
The First Book of the Kings	12:28	Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold
The First Book of the Kings	12:29	And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan
The First Book of the Kings	12:30	And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worshi
The First Book of the Kings	12:31	And he made an house of high places, and made priests of th
The First Book of the Kings	12:32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on th
The First Book of the Kings	12:33	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel th
The First Book of the Kings	13:1	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word o
The First Book of the Kings	13:2	And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said
The First Book of the Kings	13:3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign whic
The First Book of the Kings	13:4	And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of th
The First Book of the Kings	13:5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar
The First Book of the Kings	13:6	And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat no
The First Book of the Kings	13:7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, an
The First Book of the Kings	13:8	And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me hal
The First Book of the Kings	13:10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he cam
The First Book of the Kings	13:11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came an
The First Book of the Kings	13:12	And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his son
The First Book of the Kings	13:13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddle
The First Book of the Kings	13:15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread
The First Book of the Kings	13:16	And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee
The First Book of the Kings	13:17	For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat n
The First Book of the Kings	13:18	He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an ange
The First Book of the Kings	13:19	So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, an

The First Book of the Kings	13:24	And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him
The First Book of the Kings	13:25	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way
The First Book of the Kings	13:26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way hear
The First Book of the Kings	13:27	And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And the
The First Book of the Kings	13:28	And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the as
The First Book of the Kings	13:29	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and lai
The First Book of the Kings	13:30	And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned ove
The First Book of the Kings	13:33	After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, bu
The First Book of the Kings	13:34	And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even t
The First Book of the Kings	14:1	At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick
The First Book of the Kings	14:2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguis
The First Book of the Kings	14:3	And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse o
The First Book of the Kings	14:4	And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, an
