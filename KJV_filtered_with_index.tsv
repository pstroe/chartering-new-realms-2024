The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	20	But ye have not so learned Christ;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	27	Neither give place to the devil.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	9	(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:	2	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	21	But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.	2	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	2	That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	3	In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	4	When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	5	And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the kingâ€™s palace;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	6	Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	8	And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every manâ€™s pleasure.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	11	To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the kingâ€™s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the kingâ€™s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	14	And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the kingâ€™s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	15	What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	18	Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the kingâ€™s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	20	And when the kingâ€™s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	1	22	For he sent letters into all the kingâ€™s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	2	Then said the kingâ€™s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	3	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the kingâ€™s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	4	And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	5	Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	7	And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncleâ€™s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	8	So it came to pass, when the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the kingâ€™s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the kingâ€™s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	10	Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the womenâ€™s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	12	Now when every maidâ€™s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	13	Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kingâ€™s house.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the kingâ€™s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the kingâ€™s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Estherâ€™s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the kingâ€™s gate.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the kingâ€™s gate, two of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	22	And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecaiâ€™s name.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	2	23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	2	And all the kingâ€™s servants, that were in the kingâ€™s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	3	Then the kingâ€™s servants, which were in the kingâ€™s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the kingâ€™s commandment?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecaiâ€™s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	6	And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	7	In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	8	And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the kingâ€™s laws: therefore it is not for the kingâ€™s profit to suffer them.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	9	If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the kingâ€™s treasuries.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	10	And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jewsâ€™ enemy.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	12	Then were the kingâ€™s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the kingâ€™s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the kingâ€™s ring.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the kingâ€™s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	14	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	3	15	The posts went out, being hastened by the kingâ€™s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	1	When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	2	And came even before the kingâ€™s gate: for none might enter into the kingâ€™s gate clothed with sackcloth.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	3	And in every province, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	4	So Estherâ€™s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	5	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	6	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the kingâ€™s gate.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the kingâ€™s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	10	Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	11	All the kingâ€™s servants, and the people of the kingâ€™s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	12	And they told to Mordecai Estherâ€™s words.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kingâ€™s house, more than all the Jews.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy fatherâ€™s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	15	Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the kingâ€™s house, over against the kingâ€™s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	3	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	4	And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	8	If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	9	Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kingâ€™s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	12	Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	13	Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the kingâ€™s gate.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	5	14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	1	On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	3	And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the kingâ€™s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the kingâ€™s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	5	And the kingâ€™s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	8	Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	9	And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kingâ€™s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the kingâ€™s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	11	Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	12	And Mordecai came again to the kingâ€™s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	6	14	And while they were yet talking with him, came the kingâ€™s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the kingâ€™s damage.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	5	Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	6	And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the kingâ€™s mouth, they covered Hamanâ€™s face.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	9	And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the kingâ€™s wrath pacified.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	1	On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jewsâ€™ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	3	And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	5	And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the kingâ€™s provinces:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	7	Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the kingâ€™s name, and seal it with the kingâ€™s ring: for the writing which is written in the kingâ€™s name, and sealed with the kingâ€™s ring, may no man reverse.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	9	Then were the kingâ€™s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	10	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerusâ€™ name, and sealed it with the kingâ€™s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	11	Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	12	Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	13	The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	14	So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the kingâ€™s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	16	The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	8	17	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	2	The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	3	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the kingâ€™s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	6	And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	7	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	8	And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	9	And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	10	The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	12	And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the kingâ€™s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this dayâ€™s decree, and let Hamanâ€™s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Hamanâ€™s ten sons.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	15	For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	16	But the other Jews that were in the kingâ€™s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	17	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	18	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	21	To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	22	As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	24	Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	25	But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	26	Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	27	The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	28	And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	31	To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	9	32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	10	1	And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	10	2	And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?	3	KJV
The Book of Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.	3	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	31	That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of manâ€™s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which manâ€™s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are Godâ€™s husbandry, ye are Godâ€™s building.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	Every manâ€™s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every manâ€™s work of what sort it is.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	If any manâ€™s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	If any manâ€™s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	23	And ye are Christâ€™s; and Christ is Godâ€™s.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of manâ€™s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.	4	KJV

The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christâ€™s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lordâ€™s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christâ€™s servant.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idolâ€™s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	27	But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	20	But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lordâ€™s table, and of the table of devils.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but every man anotherâ€™s wealth.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	26	For the earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness thereof.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness thereof:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	29	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another manâ€™s conscience?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	33	Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lordâ€™s supper.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lordâ€™s death till he come.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lordâ€™s body.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christâ€™s at his coming.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:	4	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:	4	KJV

The First Epistle General of Peter	2	7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	9	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	10	Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	16	As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	20	For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	2	While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	4	But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	8	Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	11	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	14	But and if ye suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	17	For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	2	That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	10	As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	11	If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	13	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other menâ€™s matters.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	3	Neither as being lords over Godâ€™s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.	6	KJV
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.	6	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	20	For ye are our glory and joy.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	2	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	6	That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	17	Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice evermore.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	19	Quench not the Spirit.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophesyings.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.	7	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	8	KJV
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;	8	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jewsâ€™ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:	9	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my motherâ€™s womb, and called me by his grace,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lordâ€™s brother.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no manâ€™s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	9	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a manâ€™s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	17	And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	19	Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christâ€™s, then are ye Abrahamâ€™s seed, and heirs according to the promise.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	1	Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	17	They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	8	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christâ€™s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	5	For every man shall bear his own burden.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.	9	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	8	But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	12	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	16	For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	4	For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	13	For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	19	Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	24	But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	26	For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peopleâ€™s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	13	In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	1	Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	9	Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	10	Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	20	Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	21	And having an high priest over the house of God;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Mosesâ€™ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	18	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the kingâ€™s commandment.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	10	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?	10	KJV

The General Epistle of James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	9	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.	11	KJV

The General Epistle of James	2	16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?	11	KJV

The General Epistle of James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	2	26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	3	Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.	11	KJV

The General Epistle of James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	16	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	1	From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	13	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	14	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	4	17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	1	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.	11	KJV

The General Epistle of James	5	8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	16	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.	11	KJV

The General Epistle of James	5	19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;	11	KJV
The General Epistle of James	5	20	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.	11	KJV

The First Epistle General of John	2	4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.	12	KJV
The First Epistle General of John	2	5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.	12	KJV
The First Epistle General of John	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.	12	KJV
The First Epistle General of John	2	7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.	12	KJV

The Book of Psalms	77	18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	77	19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	77	20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	25	Man did eat angelsâ€™ food: he sent them meat to the full.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemyâ€™s hand.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	78	72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	1	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy nameâ€™s sake.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	79	13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.	15	KJV

The Book of Psalms	80	6	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	7	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	9	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	16	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	80	17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.	15	KJV

The Book of Psalms	83	6	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	83	7	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;	15	KJV
The Book of Psalms	83	8	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.	15	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:	16	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;	16	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;	16	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	18	And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?	16	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	8	And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	9	What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	26	To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	30	Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	7	Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	17	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarahâ€™s womb:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	3	And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	11	And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	13	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adamâ€™s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	17	For if by one manâ€™s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	19	For as by one manâ€™s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	2	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	3	So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	10	And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	23	And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? It is God that justifieth.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	36	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	10	And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	11	(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	24	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	26	And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	28	For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	32	Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	1	Brethren, my heartâ€™s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	3	For they being ignorant of Godâ€™s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	27	For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fatherâ€™s sakes.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	7	Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.	16	KJV

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.	16	KJV
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.	16	KJV

The Book of Ruth	1	1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.	17	KJV

The Book of Ruth	1	5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her motherâ€™s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	9	The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	11	And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	13	Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	16	And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	17	Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	21	I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husbandâ€™s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	7	And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	12	The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	14	And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	15	And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	16	And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	18	And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	19	And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The manâ€™s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	1	Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	2	And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	4	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	5	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	6	And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	8	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	9	And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	12	And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmanâ€™s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	14	And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	15	Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	16	And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	17	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	1	Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	3	And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelechâ€™s:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	4	And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	6	And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	7	Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	8	Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelechâ€™s, and all that was Chilionâ€™s and Mahlonâ€™s, of the hand of Naomi.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	12	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	16	And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	17	And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	19	And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	20	And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	21	And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,	17	KJV
The Book of Ruth	4	22	And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.	17	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christâ€™s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every manâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesusâ€™ sake.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesusâ€™ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	15	And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christâ€™s stead, be ye reconciled to God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	21	For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	14	But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	19	And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christâ€™s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christâ€™s, even so are we Christâ€™s.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other menâ€™s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another manâ€™s line of things made ready to our hand.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	26	In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.	18	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	2	For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	19	KJV

The Second Epistle General of John	1	4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	11	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.	19	KJV
The Second Epistle General of John	1	13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.	19	KJV

The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	5	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with manâ€™s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	3	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.	20	KJV
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	18	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.	20	KJV
