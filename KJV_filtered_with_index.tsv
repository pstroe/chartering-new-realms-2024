The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;	2

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	22	But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;	2

The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	1	If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2:2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	6	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	15	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 3:5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 3:19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	3	21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians	4	22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.	2
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	3	15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	2	And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 1:5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	8	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	9	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	11	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	12	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	14	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	16	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	18	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	19	I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;	3
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon	1	24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.	3
The Third Epistle General of John	1	13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	2	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	6	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	7	Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	10	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	12	Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.	5
The Third Epistle General of John	1	13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:	5
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	20	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	4	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	5	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	7	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	8	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	14	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	15	But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	18	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	20	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	21	Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	24	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	1	25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	4	To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	5	Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	9	But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	10	Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	16	As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	20	For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	2	25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	2	While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	4	But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	8	Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	11	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	14	But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	17	For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	3	22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	2	That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	10	As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	11	If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	13	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	4	19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	3	Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.	6
The First Epistle General of Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.	6
The General Epistle of James	13	25	Grace be with you all. Amen.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;	7
The General Epistle of James	1	3	Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	4	But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	8	A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:	7
The General Epistle of James	1	14	But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	19	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:	7
The General Epistle of James	1	20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:	7
The General Epistle of James	1	24	For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.	7
The General Epistle of James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 2:3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:	7
The General Epistle of James	2	4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:	7
The General Epistle of James	2	9	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	14	What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,	7
The General Epistle of James	2	16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.	7
The General Epistle of James	2	25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?	7
The General Epistle of James	2	26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	3	Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	4	Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.  Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!	7
The General Epistle of James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:	7
The General Epistle of James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?	7
The General Epistle of James	3	12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	16	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.	7
The General Epistle of James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	1	From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?	7
The General Epistle of James	4	2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?	7
The General Epistle of James	4	6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?	7
The General Epistle of James	4	13	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:	7
The General Epistle of James	4	14	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	15	For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.	7
The General Epistle of James	4	17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	1	Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	6	Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.  Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:	7
The General Epistle of James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	16	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.	7
The General Epistle of James	5	19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;	7
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	28	31	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	2	(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	4	And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	10	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	30	Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	31	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	1	32	Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	13	(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	18	And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 2:22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 2:23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 2:27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	8	And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	9	What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 3:11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	26	To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	30	Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	7	Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 4:12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	14	For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	17	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	4	25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	3	And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	11	And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 5:13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	19	For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 7:2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	3	So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	10	And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	23	And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	36	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	8	39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 9:5 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	10	And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	11	(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	14	What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	24	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	26	And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	28	For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	9	32	Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 9:33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	1	Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	3	For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 11:16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	27	For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father’s sakes.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	5	So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	7	Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	10	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	11	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	13	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	19	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	12	21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	11	And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	1	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	4	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	10	But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	11	For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	15	But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	18	For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	20	For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	21	It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	22	Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	14	23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	2	Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	3	For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	12	And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	19	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation: 15:21 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	27	It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	2	That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	6	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	9	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	10	Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus’ household.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	11	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	21	Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	22	I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	23	Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans	16	26	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:	11
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	2	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	3	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	4	To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	6	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	8	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	11	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	12	One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	15	Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	2	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	3	The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	4	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	5	To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	8	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	10	Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	2	15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	8	This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus	3	14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.	12
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	6	Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	16	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	20	And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	23	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	26	Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	27	To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	1	29	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	10	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	12	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	13	And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	15	And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	19	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	21	(Touch not; taste not; handle not;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	22	Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	1	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	3	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	4	When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	6	For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	7	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	10	And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	11	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	13	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	14	And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	18	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	20	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	21	Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	23	And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	24	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	3	25	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	1	Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	2	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	3	Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	4	That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	6	Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	7	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	8	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	9	With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	11	And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	13	For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	15	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.	14
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.	14
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	27	To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 1:21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 1:31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 2:5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 2:8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	23	And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 6:20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	27	But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	20	But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	26	For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof: 10:29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	33	Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 12:10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 12:18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 14:24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 15:4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 15:30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	55	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done with charity.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.	15
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	15
The Second General Epistle of Peter	5	14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	5	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	2	22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3:3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 3:12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.	16
The Second General Epistle of Peter	3	17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.	16
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 1:11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	15	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	2	For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	2	15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	1	This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 3:5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	8	Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	11	Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	3	16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	4	16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	13	And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	21	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	24	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	5	25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	14	That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy	6	20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:	17
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	20	For ye are our glory and joy.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	2	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you: 3:7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 4:6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	17	Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	4	18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice evermore.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	19	Quench not the Spirit.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophesyings.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren, pray for us.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.	18
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.	18
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	8	But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.  But now we see not yet all things put under him.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 2:12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	16	For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	4	For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) 3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	13	For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do, if God permit.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 6:18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	19	Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	6	20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	24	But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	26	For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	1	Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	8	13	In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	1	Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	9	Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	10	Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	20	Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 10:12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 10:21 And having an high priest over the house of God;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 11:18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 11:19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	10	For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	17	For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	20	(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	22	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 12:26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	27	And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	1	Let brotherly love continue.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	5	Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	19	But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	22	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews	13	24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.  They of Italy salute you.	21
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	2	Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	6	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	8	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	10	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	12	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	13	In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	20	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	21	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	22	And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	1	23	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	1	And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	3	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	6	And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	7	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	11	Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	12	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	15	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	21	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	2	22	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 3:4 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	6	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 3:7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	9	And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	19	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	3	20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 3:21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	2	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 4:3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	14	That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	15	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	20	But ye have not so learned Christ;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	27	Neither give place to the devil.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	4	32	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	9	(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	2	Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	21	But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.	22
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	5	Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 1:6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	1	12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	9	Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	2	17	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	15	Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.	23
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	16	24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	1	24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	15	And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	5	21	For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 6:6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	9	As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	6	18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	3	For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	14	But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	19	And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	6	But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	9	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	10	For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	10	18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 11:26 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	12	21	And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.	24
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you.	24
The First Epistle General of John	3	18	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	3	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	25
The First Epistle General of John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.  And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	15	Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	25
The First Epistle General of John	2	29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	12	Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	16	Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	17	But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.	25
The First Epistle General of John	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.  And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	19	We love him, because he first loved us.	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?	25
The First Epistle General of John	4	21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	8	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.	25
The First Epistle General of John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	25
The Second Epistle General of John	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	2	For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	3	Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	11	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.	26
The Second Epistle General of John	1	12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.	26
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 1:3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	5	To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	9	As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	14	And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 2:9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	17	And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	19	Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	1	Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	17	They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	4	31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	8	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	5	26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	5	For every man shall bear his own burden.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.	27
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.	27
