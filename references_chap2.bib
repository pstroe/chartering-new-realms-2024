abstract = "Although there are several sources where to find historical texts, they usually are available in the original language that makes them generally inaccessible. This paper presents the development of state-of-the-art Neural Machine Systems for the low-resourced Latin-Spanish language pair. First, we build a Transformer-based Machine Translation system on the Bible parallel corpus. Then, we build a comparable corpus from Saint Augustine texts and their translations. We use this corpus to study the domain adaptation case from the Bible texts to Saint Augustine{'}s works. Results show the difficulties of handling a low-resourced language as Latin. First, we noticed the importance of having enough data, since the systems do not achieve high BLEU scores. Regarding domain adaptation, results show how using in-domain data helps systems to achieve a better quality translation. Also, we observed that it is needed a higher amount of data to perform an effective vocabulary extension that includes in-domain vocabulary.",

While most work has covered the automatic translation of technical, legal and medical texts, the application of MT to literary texts and the human role in this process have been underexplored. In an effort to bridge the gap of this under-researched area, this paper presents the results of a study which seeks to evaluate the performance of three MT systems applied to two different literary genres, two novels (1984 by George Orwell and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen) and two poems (I Felt a Funeral in my Brain by Emily Dickinson and Siren Song by Margaret Atwood) representing different literary periods and timelines. The evaluation was conducted by way of the automatic evaluation metric BLEU to objectively assess the performance that the MT system shows on each genre. The limitations of this study are also outlined.",
