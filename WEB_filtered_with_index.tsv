Colossians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	2	to the saints and faithful brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} in Christ at Colossae:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	6	which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	7	even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	8	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	9	For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	10	that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	11	strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	13	who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	14	in whom we have our redemption,{TR adds through his blood,} the forgiveness of our sins;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	16	For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	17	He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	19	For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	21	You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	22	yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	23	if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.	1	WEB
Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	25	of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	26	the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,	1	WEB
Colossians	1	27	to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	28	whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;	1	WEB
Colossians	1	29	for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	1	For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;	1	WEB
Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	3	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	4	Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	5	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	6	As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	8	Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	9	For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	10	and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;	1	WEB
Colossians	2	11	in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;	1	WEB
Colossians	2	12	having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	13	You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh.  He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	14	wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;	1	WEB
Colossians	2	15	having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	18	Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	19	and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.	1	WEB
Colossians	2	20	If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,	1	WEB
Colossians	2	21	Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch	1	WEB
Colossians	2	22	(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?	1	WEB
Colossians	2	23	Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	1	If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	2	Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	3	For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	4	When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	5	Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;	1	WEB
Colossians	3	6	for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	7	You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;	1	WEB
Colossians	3	8	but now you also put them all away:  anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	9	Don't lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,	1	WEB
Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,	1	WEB
Colossians	3	11	where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;	1	WEB
Colossians	3	13	bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	14	Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	17	Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	18	Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives, and don't be bitter against them.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	20	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	21	Fathers, don't provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	22	Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	23	And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,	1	WEB
Colossians	3	24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.	1	WEB
Colossians	3	25	But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	1	Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	2	Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;	1	WEB
Colossians	4	3	praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;	1	WEB
Colossians	4	4	that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	6	Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	7	All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	8	I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,	1	WEB
Colossians	4	9	together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.  They will make known to you everything that is going on here.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, if he comes to you, receive him),	1	WEB
Colossians	4	11	and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	13	For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	15	Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	16	When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.	1	WEB
Colossians	4	17	Tell Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.	1	WEB
Ephesians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.  Amen.	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	5	having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	8	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	9	making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	10	to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	11	in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	12	to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	13	in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	14	who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	15	For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	16	don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	18	having the eyes of your hearts{TR reads understanding instead of hearts} enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	19	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	20	which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	21	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	22	He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,	2	WEB
Ephesians	1	23	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	1	You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	2	in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	3	among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	4	But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	5	even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	6	and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	8	for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	9	not of works, that no one would boast.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, (in the flesh, made by hands);	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	12	that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	20	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	21	in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;	2	WEB
Ephesians	2	22	in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	1	For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	2	if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	3	how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	4	by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	7	of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	8	To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	9	and to make all men see what is the administration{TR reads fellowship instead of administration} of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	10	to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	14	For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	18	may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	19	and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,	2	WEB
Ephesians	3	21	to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever.  Amen.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	1	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	3	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	8	Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.{Psalm 68:18}	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	9	Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	11	He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds{or, pastors} and teachers;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	14	that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	15	but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	16	from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	19	who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ that way;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	22	that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	23	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	25	Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor.  For we are members of one another.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	26	Be angry, and don't sin.{Psalm 4:4} Don't let the sun go down on your wrath,	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	28	Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	30	Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.	2	WEB
Ephesians	4	32	And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	1	Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	2	Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	3	But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	4	nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	5	Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words.  For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	7	Therefore don't be partakers with them.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	8	For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	9	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	10	proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	11	Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	12	For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	13	But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	14	Therefore he says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	15	Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	17	Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	18	Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	21	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	22	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	24	But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	27	that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	28	Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies.  He who loves his own wife loves himself.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	31	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife.  The two will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.	2	WEB
Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	2	Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	3	that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.{Deuteronomy 5:16}	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	4	You fathers, don't provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	5	Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	6	not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	7	with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	9	You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	10	Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	13	Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	15	and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	16	above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	18	with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	19	on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	21	But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.	2	WEB
Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2	WEB
Esther	13	31	and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.  Remember me, my God, for good.	3	WEB
Esther	1	1	Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),	3	WEB
Esther	1	2	that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,	3	WEB
Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.	3	WEB
Esther	1	4	He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.	3	WEB
Esther	1	5	When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.	3	WEB
Esther	1	6	There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars.  The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.	3	WEB
Esther	1	7	They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.	3	WEB
Esther	1	8	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.	3	WEB
Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.	3	WEB
Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,	3	WEB
Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.	3	WEB
Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the eunuchs.  Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.	3	WEB
Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;	3	WEB
Esther	1	14	and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),	3	WEB
Esther	1	15	What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?	3	WEB
Esther	1	16	Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.	3	WEB
Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.'	3	WEB
Esther	1	18	Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.	3	WEB
Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.	3	WEB
Esther	1	20	When the king's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.	3	WEB
Esther	1	21	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:	3	WEB
Esther	1	22	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.	3	WEB
Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.	3	WEB
Esther	2	2	Then the king's servants who served him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.	3	WEB
Esther	2	3	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;	3	WEB
Esther	2	4	and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king, and he did so.	3	WEB
Esther	2	5	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,	3	WEB
Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.	3	WEB
Esther	2	7	He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother.  The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.	3	WEB
Esther	2	8	So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.	3	WEB
Esther	2	9	The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house.  He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house.	3	WEB
Esther	2	10	Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.	3	WEB
Esther	2	11	Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.	3	WEB
Esther	2	12	Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).	3	WEB
Esther	2	13	The young woman then came to the king like this:  whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house.	3	WEB
Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines.  She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.	3	WEB
Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised.  Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.	3	WEB
Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	3	WEB
Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.	3	WEB
Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.	3	WEB
Esther	2	19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.	3	WEB
Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.	3	WEB
Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.	3	WEB
Esther	2	22	This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.	3	WEB
Esther	2	23	When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence.	3	WEB
Esther	3	1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.	3	WEB
Esther	3	2	All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him.  But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.	3	WEB
Esther	3	3	Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you disobey the king's commandment?	3	WEB
Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.	3	WEB
Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.	3	WEB
Esther	3	6	But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.	3	WEB
Esther	3	7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	3	WEB
Esther	3	8	Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.	3	WEB
Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.	3	WEB
Esther	3	10	The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.	3	WEB
Esther	3	11	The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.	3	WEB
Esther	3	12	Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language.  It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring.	3	WEB
Esther	3	13	Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.	3	WEB
Esther	3	14	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.	3	WEB
Esther	3	15	The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.	3	WEB
Esther	4	1	Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.	3	WEB
Esther	4	2	He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.	3	WEB
Esther	4	3	In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.	3	WEB
Esther	4	4	Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved.  She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.	3	WEB
Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.	3	WEB
Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate.	3	WEB
Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.	3	WEB
Esther	4	8	He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.	3	WEB
Esther	4	9	Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.	3	WEB
Esther	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:	3	WEB
Esther	4	11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.	3	WEB
Esther	4	12	They told to Mordecai Esther's words.	3	WEB
Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, Don't think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.	3	WEB
Esther	4	14	For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish.  Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?	3	WEB
Esther	4	15	Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,	3	WEB
Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day.  I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.	3	WEB
Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.	3	WEB
Esther	5	1	Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house.  The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.	3	WEB
Esther	5	2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.	3	WEB
Esther	5	3	Then the king asked her, What would you like, queen Esther?  What is your request?  It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.	3	WEB
Esther	5	4	Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.	3	WEB
Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.  So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	3	WEB
Esther	5	6	The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	3	WEB
Esther	5	7	Then Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is this.	3	WEB
Esther	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.	3	WEB
Esther	5	9	Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.	3	WEB
Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.	3	WEB
Esther	5	11	Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.	3	WEB
Esther	5	12	Haman also said, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.	3	WEB
Esther	5	13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.	3	WEB
Esther	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.	3	WEB
Esther	6	1	On that night, the king couldn't sleep.  He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.	3	WEB
Esther	6	2	It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.	3	WEB
Esther	6	3	The king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?  Then the king's servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him.	3	WEB
Esther	6	4	The king said, Who is in the court?  Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.	3	WEB
Esther	6	5	The king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. The king said, Let him come in.	3	WEB
Esther	6	6	So Haman came in.  The king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?	3	WEB
Esther	6	7	Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,	3	WEB
Esther	6	8	let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set.	3	WEB
Esther	6	9	Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!'	3	WEB
Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate.  Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.	3	WEB
Esther	6	11	Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!	3	WEB
Esther	6	12	Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.	3	WEB
Esther	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.  Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.	3	WEB
Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	3	WEB
Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.	3	WEB
Esther	7	2	The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request?  Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	3	WEB
Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.	3	WEB
Esther	7	4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.  But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's loss.	3	WEB
Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?	3	WEB
Esther	7	6	Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!  Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.	3	WEB
Esther	7	7	The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden.  Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.	3	WEB
Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was.  Then the king said, Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?  As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.	3	WEB
Esther	7	9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman's house.  The king said, Hang him on it!	3	WEB
Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.  Then was the king's wrath pacified.	3	WEB
Esther	8	1	On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen.  Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.	3	WEB
Esther	8	2	The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.  Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.	3	WEB
Esther	8	3	Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.	3	WEB
Esther	8	4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.	3	WEB
Esther	8	5	She said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.	3	WEB
Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?	3	WEB
Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.	3	WEB
Esther	8	8	Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may not be reversed by any man.	3	WEB
Esther	8	9	Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.	3	WEB
Esther	8	10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds.	3	WEB
Esther	8	11	In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,	3	WEB
Esther	8	12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	3	WEB
Esther	8	13	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.	3	WEB
Esther	8	14	So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.	3	WEB
Esther	8	15	Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.	3	WEB
Esther	8	16	The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.	3	WEB
Esther	8	17	In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day.  Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.	3	WEB
Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),	3	WEB
Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them.  No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.	3	WEB
Esther	9	3	All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.	3	WEB
Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.	3	WEB
Esther	9	5	The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.	3	WEB
Esther	9	6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.	3	WEB
Esther	9	7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,	3	WEB
Esther	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,	3	WEB
Esther	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,	3	WEB
Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.	3	WEB
Esther	9	11	On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.	3	WEB
Esther	9	12	The king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!  Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you.  What is your further request? It shall be done.	3	WEB
Esther	9	13	Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.	3	WEB
Esther	9	14	The king commanded this to be done.  A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.	3	WEB
Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn't lay their hand on the spoil.	3	WEB
Esther	9	16	The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.	3	WEB
Esther	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	3	WEB
Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	3	WEB
Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.	3	WEB
Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,	3	WEB
Esther	9	21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,	3	WEB
Esther	9	22	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.	3	WEB
Esther	9	23	The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;	3	WEB
Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;	3	WEB
Esther	9	25	but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.	3	WEB
Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim,{Purim is the Hebrew plural for pur, which means lot.} from the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,	3	WEB
Esther	9	27	the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;	3	WEB
Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their seed.	3	WEB
Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.	3	WEB
Esther	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,	3	WEB
Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.	3	WEB
Esther	9	32	The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.	3	WEB
Esther	10	1	King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.	3	WEB
Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?	3	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	27	{See Romans 14:23} {TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27.}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	2	to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	5	that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	7	so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	8	who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	10	Now I beg you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	11	For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are contentions among you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow Cephas, and, I follow Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided?  Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	15	so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	16	(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News-- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.{Isaiah 29:14}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the lawyer of this world?  Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	22	For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	26	For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	27	but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise.  God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	28	and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should boast before God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	30	But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	1	31	that, according as it is written, He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	1	When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	3	I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	4	My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	5	that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	6	We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this world has known.  For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear, which didn't enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him.{Isaiah 64:4}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	10	But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him?  Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	12	But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	14	Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	15	But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?{Isaiah 40:13} But we have Christ's mind.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	1	Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly.  For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	4	For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, aren't you fleshly?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted.  Apollos watered.  But God gave the increase.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	7	So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God's fellow workers.  You are God's farming, God's building.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	12	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	13	each man's work will be revealed.  For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	14	If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	15	If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	16	Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself.  If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written, He has taken the wise in their craftiness.{Job 5:13}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.{Psalm 94:11}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast in men.  For all things are yours,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	3	23	and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	1	So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	2	Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment.  Yes, I don't judge my own self.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing against myself.  Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts.  Then each man will get his praise from God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	6	Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	7	For who makes you different?  And what do you have that you didn't receive?  But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	8	You are already filled.  You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us.  Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	9	For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death.  For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.  You have honor, but we have dishonor.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	11	Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	12	We toil, working with our own hands.  When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we entreat.  We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	14	I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	15	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	16	I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	17	Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	20	For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you want?  Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	1	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	2	You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	3	For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	5	are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good.  Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened.  For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	10	yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	11	But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	5	13	But those who are outside, God judges.  Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.{Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	2	Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	3	Don't you know that we will judge angels?  How much more, things that pertain to this life?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	4	If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	5	I say this to move you to shame.  Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	7	Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another.  Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	8	No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	9	Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God?  Don't be deceived.  Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	11	Such were some of you, but you were washed.  But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	13	Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	14	Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	15	Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	16	Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, The two, says he, will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	18	Flee sexual immorality!  Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	19	Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God?  You are not your own,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	6	20	for you were bought with a price.  Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	2	But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	4	The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	5	Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	7	Yet I wish that all men were like me.  However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	9	But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	11	(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	13	The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	17	Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk.  So I command in all the assemblies.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called having been circumcised?  Let him not become uncircumcised.  Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	20	Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you called being a bondservant?  Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	22	For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man.  Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price.  Don't become bondservants of men.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	24	Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	26	I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife?  Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife?  Don't seek a wife.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry, you have not sinned.  If a virgin marries, she has not sinned.  Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	29	But I say this, brothers:  the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	32	But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	33	but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	34	There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world-- how she may please her husband.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	35	This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin.  Let them marry.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	38	So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols:  We know that we all have knowledge.  Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	2	But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	4	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	5	For though there are things that are called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many gods and many lords;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	7	However, that knowledge isn't in all men.  But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	8	But food will not commend us to God.  For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	9	But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	10	For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	11	And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	12	Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free?  Am I not an apostle?  Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord?  Aren't you my work in the Lord?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	4	Have we no right to eat and to drink?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	5	Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	6	Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	7	What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	8	Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} Is it for the oxen that God cares,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	10	or does he say it assuredly for our sake?  Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	13	Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	14	Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward?  That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	19	For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	21	to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	23	Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	24	Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize?  Run like that, that you may win.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	25	Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things.  Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	26	I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly.  I fight like that, as not beating the air,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	9	27	but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	1	Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	2	and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	3	and all ate the same spiritual food;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink.  For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	5	However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	7	Neither be idolaters, as some of them were.  As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.{Exodus 32:6}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	10	Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men.  Judge what I say.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, isn't it a communion of the body of Christ?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	18	Consider Israel according to the flesh.  Don't those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the altar?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	19	What am I saying then?  That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have communion with demons.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	21	You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  Are we stronger than he?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	25	Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	26	for the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness.{Psalm 24:1}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	27	But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	28	But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience.  For the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	29	Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	32	Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	10	33	even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	1	Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head.  For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	8	For man is not from woman, but woman from man;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	9	for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	10	For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	12	For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves.  Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	14	Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	17	But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	19	For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	20	When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	21	For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	22	What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have?  What shall I tell you?  Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	24	When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you.  Do this in memory of me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	25	In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	31	For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	33	Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	11	34	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment.  The rest I will set in order whenever I come.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathen{or Gentiles}, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, Jesus is accursed.  No one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	4	Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	5	There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	6	There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	9	to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	10	and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	11	But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot would say, Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body, it is not therefore not part of the body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	16	If the ear would say, Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body, it's not therefore not part of the body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	18	But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one member, where would the body be?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	20	But now they are many members, but one body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	21	The eye can't tell the hand, I have no need for you, or again the head to the feet, I have no need for you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	22	No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	23	Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	24	whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	26	When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	28	God has set some in the assembly:  first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healings?  Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	12	31	But earnestly desire the best gifts.  Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	3	If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	5	doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	6	doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails.  But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with.  Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	10	but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child.  Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	12	For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	13	13	But now faith, hope, and love remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	1	Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	2	For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	3	But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	4	He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy.  For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	6	But now, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	9	So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	11	If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	12	So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	15	What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.  I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	17	For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	19	However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	20	Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.{Isaiah 28:11-12}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	22	Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	25	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.  So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	26	What is it then, brothers?  When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation.  Let all things be done to build each other up.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	27	If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	31	For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	34	let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	36	What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	37	If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	1	Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	2	by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	6	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	8	and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am.  His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	14	If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	15	Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	17	If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	18	Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	19	If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead.  He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	21	For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order:  Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	24	Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be abolished is death.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	27	For, He put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:6} But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	28	When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	29	Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	30	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	31	I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	32	If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me?  If the dead are not raised, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.{Isaiah 22:13}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	33	Don't be deceived!  Evil companionships corrupt good morals.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	34	Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge of God.  I say this to your shame.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say, How are the dead raised? and, With what kind of body do they come?	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	36	You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	37	That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.  It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul.{Genesis 2:7} The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	46	However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth, made of dust.  The second man is the Lord from heaven.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	48	As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	49	As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's{NU, TR read we will instead of let's} also bear the image of the heavenly.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	54	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen:  Death is swallowed up in victory.{Isaiah 25:8}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	55	Death, where is your sting?  Hades{or, Hell}, where is your victory?{Hosea 13:14}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	4	If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	6	But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	7	For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	9	for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	11	Therefore let no one despise him.  But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	13	Watch!  Stand firm in the faith!  Be courageous!  Be strong!	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	14	Let all that you do be done in love.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	15	Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	16	that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	17	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours.  Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	19	The assemblies of Asia greet you.  Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers greet you.  Greet one another with a holy kiss.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	21	This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	22	If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed{Greek: anathema.}. Come, Lord!{Aramaic: Maranatha!}	4	WEB
1 Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	4	WEB
1 John	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and forever.  Amen.	5	WEB
1 John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life	5	WEB
1 John	1	2	(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);	5	WEB
1 John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us.  Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.	5	WEB
1 John	1	4	And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.	5	WEB
1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	5	WEB
1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.	5	WEB
1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.	5	WEB
1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	5	WEB
1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	5	WEB
1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	5	WEB
1 John	2	1	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.  If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.	5	WEB
1 John	2	2	And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.	5	WEB
1 John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.	5	WEB
1 John	2	4	One who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.	5	WEB
1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him.  This is how we know that we are in him:	5	WEB
1 John	2	6	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.	5	WEB
1 John	2	7	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.	5	WEB
1 John	2	8	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.	5	WEB
1 John	2	9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.	5	WEB
1 John	2	10	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.	5	WEB
1 John	2	11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.	5	WEB
1 John	2	12	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.	5	WEB
1 John	2	13	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.	5	WEB
1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.	5	WEB
1 John	2	15	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.	5	WEB
1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.	5	WEB
1 John	2	17	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.	5	WEB
1 John	2	18	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.	5	WEB
1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.	5	WEB
1 John	2	20	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.	5	WEB
1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.	5	WEB
1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.	5	WEB
1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.	5	WEB
1 John	2	24	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning.  If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.	5	WEB
1 John	2	25	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.	5	WEB
1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.	5	WEB
1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.	5	WEB
1 John	2	28	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	5	WEB
1 John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.	5	WEB
1 John	3	1	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!  For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.	5	WEB
1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be.  But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.	5	WEB
1 John	3	3	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.	5	WEB
1 John	3	4	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.	5	WEB
1 John	3	5	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.	5	WEB
1 John	3	6	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.	5	WEB
1 John	3	7	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.	5	WEB
1 John	3	8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	5	WEB
1 John	3	9	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.	5	WEB
1 John	3	10	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.  Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.	5	WEB
1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;	5	WEB
1 John	3	12	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him?  Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.	5	WEB
1 John	3	13	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.	5	WEB
1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.  He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.	5	WEB
1 John	3	15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.	5	WEB
1 John	3	16	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.	5	WEB
1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?	5	WEB
1 John	3	18	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.	5	WEB
1 John	3	19	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,	5	WEB
1 John	3	20	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.	5	WEB
1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;	5	WEB
1 John	3	22	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.	5	WEB
1 John	3	23	This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.	5	WEB
1 John	3	24	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.	5	WEB
1 John	4	1	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.	5	WEB
1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,	5	WEB
1 John	4	3	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.	5	WEB
1 John	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.	5	WEB
1 John	4	5	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.	5	WEB
1 John	4	6	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	5	WEB
1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.	5	WEB
1 John	4	8	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.	5	WEB
1 John	4	9	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.	5	WEB
1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins.	5	WEB
1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.	5	WEB
1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.	5	WEB
1 John	4	13	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.	5	WEB
1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.	5	WEB
1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.	5	WEB
1 John	4	16	We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.	5	WEB
1 John	4	17	In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.	5	WEB
1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made perfect in love.	5	WEB
1 John	4	19	We love Him, because he first loved us.	5	WEB
1 John	4	20	If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?	5	WEB
1 John	4	21	This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.	5	WEB
1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him.	5	WEB
1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.	5	WEB
1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.	5	WEB
1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world:  your faith.	5	WEB
1 John	5	5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	5	WEB
1 John	5	6	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.	5	WEB
1 John	5	7	For there are three who testify{Only a few recent manuscripts add in heaven:  the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.  And there are three that testify on earth}:	5	WEB
1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.	5	WEB
1 John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.	5	WEB
1 John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.	5	WEB
1 John	5	11	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	5	WEB
1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life.  He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.	5	WEB
1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.	5	WEB
1 John	5	14	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.	5	WEB
1 John	5	15	And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.	5	WEB
1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.	5	WEB
1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.	5	WEB
1 John	5	18	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.	5	WEB
1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.	5	WEB
1 John	5	20	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	5	WEB
1 Peter	5	20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood:  Grace to you and peace be multiplied.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	4	to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	5	who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	6	Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	7	that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ--	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	8	whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	9	receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	10	Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	11	searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	12	To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	13	Therefore, prepare your minds for action,{literally, gird up the waist of your mind} be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	14	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	15	but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	16	because it is written, You shall be holy; for I am holy.{Leviticus 11:44-45}	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	17	If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	18	knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	19	but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	20	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	21	who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	22	Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	23	having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	24	For, All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass.  The grass withers, and its flower falls;	6	WEB
1 Peter	1	25	but the Lord's word endures forever.{Isaiah 40:6-8} This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	1	Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	2	as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	3	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	4	coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	5	You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	6	Because it is contained in Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	7	For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,{Psalm 118:22}	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	8	and, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.{Isaiah 8:14} For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	10	who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	11	Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	12	having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	13	Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:  whether to the king, as supreme;	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	14	or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	15	For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	16	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	17	Honor all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God. Honor the king.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	18	Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	19	For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	20	For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	21	For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you{TR reads us instead of you} an example, that you should follow his steps,	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	22	who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.{Isaiah 53:9}	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	23	Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back.  When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	24	who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.	6	WEB
1 Peter	2	25	For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer{Overseer is from the Greek episkopon, which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent.} of your souls.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	1	In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any don't obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	2	seeing your pure behavior in fear.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	3	Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	4	but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	5	For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	7	You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	8	Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	10	For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	11	Let him turn away from evil, and do good.  Let him seek peace, and pursue it.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.{Psalm 34:12-16}	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	13	Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed.  Don't fear what they fear, neither be troubled.{Isaiah 8:12}	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	16	having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good manner of life in Christ.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	17	For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	18	Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	19	in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	20	who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	21	This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-- not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,	6	WEB
1 Peter	3	22	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	2	that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	3	For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	4	They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	5	who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	6	For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is near.  Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	8	And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	10	As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.  Amen.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	12	Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	13	But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	14	If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	16	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God.  If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God?	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	18	If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?{Proverbs 11:31}	6	WEB
1 Peter	4	19	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	1	I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	2	Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	3	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	4	When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	5	Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	7	casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	8	Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful.  Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	9	Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	10	But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	11	To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.  Amen.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.	6	WEB
1 Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.	6	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	18	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand:  remember my bonds. Grace be with you.  Amen.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	2	We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	4	We know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} loved by God, that you are chosen,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	5	and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	6	You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	8	For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	1	For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	2	but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	4	But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	5	For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	8	Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	11	As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	12	to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary to all men;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always.  But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	18	because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again-- but Satan hindered us.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} at his coming?	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and our joy.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	1	Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	3	that no one be moved by these afflictions.  For you know that we are appointed to this task.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	4	For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	6	But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	7	for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	10	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	12	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	3	13	to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	1	Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God:  your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	4	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	5	not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	6	that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you.  For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	10	for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia.  But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	11	and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we charged you;	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	12	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	13	But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	15	For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	1	But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	3	For when they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	5	You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	6	so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	10	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	12	But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	13	and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	14	We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice always.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	18	In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	19	Don't quench the Spirit.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	20	Don't despise prophesies.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	21	Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from every form of evil.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	23	May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	24	He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	25	Brothers, pray for us.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.	7	WEB
1 Thessalonians	5	27	I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.	7	WEB
1 Timothy	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my true child in faith:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	4	neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith--	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	5	but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	6	from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	9	as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	10	for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	11	according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	12	And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	13	although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	14	The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	15	The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	16	However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever.  Amen.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	1	20	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	1	I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	2	for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	4	who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	7	to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	9	In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	10	but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	12	But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	14	Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	2	15	but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	1	This is a faithful saying:  if a man seeks the office of an overseer{or, superintendents, or bishops}, he desires a good work.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	2	The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	3	not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	4	one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	5	(but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	6	not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	8	Servants{or, Deacons.}, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	10	Let them also first be tested; then let them serve{or, serve as deacons} if they are blameless.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	11	Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	12	Let servants{or, deacons} be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	13	For those who have served well{or, served well as deacons} gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	14	These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	15	but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	3	16	Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	2	through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	3	forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	6	If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives' fables.  Exercise yourself toward godliness.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	9	This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	10	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	14	Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	15	Be diligent in these things.  Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	4	16	Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	1	Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	2	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are widows indeed.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is{TR adds good and} acceptable in the sight of God.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	5	Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	6	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	7	Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	8	But if anyone doesn't provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	9	Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	10	being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	11	But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	12	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	13	Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	14	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	15	For already some have turned aside after Satan.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	17	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} And, The laborer is worthy of his wages.{Luke 10:7; Leviticus 19:13}	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	19	Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	20	Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	21	I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	22	Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins.  Keep yourself pure.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	23	Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	24	Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	5	25	In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	1	Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	4	he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	5	constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.{NU omits Withdraw yourself from such.}	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can't carry anything out.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	8	But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	9	But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	11	But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith.  Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	13	I charge you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	14	that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	15	which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	16	who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see:  to whom be honor and eternal power.  Amen.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	17	Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	18	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.	8	WEB
1 Timothy	6	20	Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;	8	WEB
Galatians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.  Amen.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),	9	WEB
Galatians	1	2	and all the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:	9	WEB
Galatians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,	9	WEB
Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father--	9	WEB
Galatians	1	5	to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	6	I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different good news;	9	WEB
Galatians	1	7	and there isn't another good news.  Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	8	But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any good news other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	9	As we have said before, so I now say again:  if any man preaches to you any good news other than that which you received, let him be cursed.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God?  Or am I striving to please men?  For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	11	But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	14	I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	15	But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,	9	WEB
Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,	9	WEB
Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia.  Then I returned to Damascus.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	19	But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	20	Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	21	Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	22	I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,	9	WEB
Galatians	1	23	but they only heard:  He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.	9	WEB
Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	1	Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	2	I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	4	This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;	9	WEB
Galatians	2	5	to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	6	But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,	9	WEB
Galatians	2	7	but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision	9	WEB
Galatians	2	8	(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);	9	WEB
Galatians	2	9	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	12	For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?	9	WEB
Galatians	2	15	We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,	9	WEB
Galatians	2	16	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	17	But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!	9	WEB
Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	19	For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me.  That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.	9	WEB
Galatians	2	21	I don't make void the grace of God.  For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!	9	WEB
Galatians	3	1	Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?	9	WEB
Galatians	3	2	I just want to learn this from you.  Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?	9	WEB
Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish?  Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?	9	WEB
Galatians	3	4	Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?	9	WEB
Galatians	3	5	He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?	9	WEB
Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	7	Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations will be blessed.{Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18}	9	WEB
Galatians	3	9	So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.{Deuteronomy 27:26}	9	WEB
Galatians	3	11	Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, The righteous will live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}	9	WEB
Galatians	3	12	The law is not of faith, but, The man who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}	9	WEB
Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.  For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,{Deuteronomy 21:23}	9	WEB
Galatians	3	14	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	15	Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, To seeds, as of many, but as of one, To your seed,{Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7} which is Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	17	Now I say this.  A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	19	What then is the law?  It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	22	But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	24	So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	26	For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.	9	WEB
Galatians	3	29	If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	1	But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;	9	WEB
Galatians	4	2	but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,	9	WEB
Galatians	4	5	that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	6	And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba,{Abba is a Greek spelling for the Aramaic word for Father or Daddy used in a familiar, respectful, and loving way.} Father!	9	WEB
Galatians	4	7	So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	8	However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?	9	WEB
Galatians	4	10	You observe days, months, seasons, and years.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	12	I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are.  You did me no wrong,	9	WEB
Galatians	4	13	but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	14	That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	15	What was the blessing you enjoyed?  For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	16	So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?	9	WEB
Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek you in no good way.  No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	18	But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--	9	WEB
Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?	9	WEB
Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	23	However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	24	These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	25	For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband.{Isaiah 54:1}	9	WEB
Galatians	4	28	Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	29	But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.	9	WEB
Galatians	4	30	However what does the Scripture say?  Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman.{Genesis 21:10}	9	WEB
Galatians	4	31	So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	1	Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	2	Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	3	Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	4	You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law.  You have fallen away from grace.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	5	For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	7	You were running well!  Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?	9	WEB
Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him who calls you.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	9	A little yeast grows through the whole lump.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	10	I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way.  But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	11	But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted?  Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	13	For you, brothers, were called for freedom.  Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}	9	WEB
Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,	9	WEB
Galatians	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,	9	WEB
Galatians	5	21	envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,{or, faithfulness}	9	WEB
Galatians	5	23	gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.	9	WEB
Galatians	5	26	Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	1	Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	2	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	3	For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	4	But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	5	For each man will bear his own burden.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	6	But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	7	Don't be deceived.  God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	8	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	9	Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	10	So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	13	For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	16	As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel.	9	WEB
Galatians	6	17	From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.	9	WEB
Hebrews	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	1	God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	2	has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	3	His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	4	having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did he say at any time, You are my Son. Today have I become your father?{Psalm 2:7} and again, I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?{2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13}	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	6	Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, Let all the angels of God worship him.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	7	Of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire.{Psalm 104:4}	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	8	But of the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.{Psalm 45:6-7}	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	10	And, You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	11	They will perish, but you continue.  They all will grow old like a garment does.	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	12	As a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same.  Your years will not fail.{Psalm 102:25-27}	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	13	But which of the angels has he told at any time, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?{Psalm 110:1}	10	WEB
Hebrews	1	14	Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	3	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation-- which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	5	For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	6	But one has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that you think of him?  Or the son of man, that you care for him?	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels.  You crowned him with glory and honor.{TR adds and set him over the works of your hands}	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	8	You have put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:4-6} For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him.  But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	9	But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	11	For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.},	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	12	saying, I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.{Psalm 22:22}	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	13	Again, I will put my trust in him.{Isaiah 8:17} Again, Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.{Isaiah 8:18}	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	14	Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	15	and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	16	For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	17	Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.	10	WEB
Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	3	For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	5	Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	6	but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear his voice,	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	8	don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	11	as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into my rest.'{Psalm 95:7-11}	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	12	Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	13	but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	15	while it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.{Psalm 95:7-8}	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	16	For who, when they heard, rebelled?  No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	17	With whom was he displeased forty years?  Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	18	To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?	10	WEB
Hebrews	3	19	We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;{Psalm 95:11} although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	4	For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, God rested on the seventh day from all his works;{Genesis 2:2}	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	5	and in this place again, They will not enter into my rest.{Psalm 95:11}	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	7	he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts.{Psalm 95:7-8}	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	9	There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	10	For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	13	There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	14	Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	15	For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.	10	WEB
Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	2	The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	3	Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	4	Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, You are my Son. Today I have become your father.{Psalm 2:7}	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	6	As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	7	He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	8	though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	9	Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	10	named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	11	About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	12	For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.	10	WEB
Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	2	of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	3	This will we do, if God permits.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	4	For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	5	and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	6	and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	7	For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	8	but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	11	We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	12	that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	13	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	14	saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.{Genesis 22:17}	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	15	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	16	For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	17	In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	18	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;	10	WEB
Hebrews	6	20	where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	5	They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	6	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	8	Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	9	We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	11	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	15	This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	16	who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	17	for it is testified, You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	18	For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	19	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	20	Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	21	(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, The Lord swore and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'{Psalm 110:4}	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	22	By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	23	Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	24	But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	25	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	26	For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	27	who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.	10	WEB
Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	1	Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	2	a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.  Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	5	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.{Exodus 25:40}	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	6	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	11	They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,{TR reads neighbor instead of fellow citizen} and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.  I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.{Jeremiah 31:31-34}	10	WEB
Hebrews	8	13	In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	1	Now indeed even the first{TR adds tabernacle} covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was prepared.  In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	3	After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	4	having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	5	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	6	Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	7	but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	9	which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	10	being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	11	But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	12	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	15	For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	16	For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	17	For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	20	saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.{Exodus 24:8}	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	22	According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	23	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	24	For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	25	nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	26	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world.  But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	27	Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,	10	WEB
Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	2	Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	5	Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me;	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	6	You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	7	Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'{Psalm 40:6-8}	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	8	Previously saying, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them (those which are offered according to the law),	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	9	then he has said, Behold, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	10	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	11	Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	12	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	13	from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'{Jeremiah 31:33} then he says,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	17	I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.{Jeremiah 31:34}	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	21	and having a great priest over the house of God,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	22	let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	23	let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	24	Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	28	A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	30	For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, says the Lord, I will repay.{Deuteronomy 32:35} Again, The Lord will judge his people.{Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14}	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	32	But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	33	partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	35	Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	36	For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	37	In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	38	But the righteous will live by faith.  If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.{Habakkuk 2:3-4}	10	WEB
Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	2	For by this, the elders obtained testimony.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	3	By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	4	By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	5	By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	6	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	7	By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	8	By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	9	By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	11	By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	12	Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen{TR adds and being convinced of} them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	15	If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	17	By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	18	even he to whom it was said, In Isaac will your seed be called;{Genesis 21:12}	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	19	concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	20	By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	21	By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	22	By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	23	By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	24	By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	26	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	27	By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	28	By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	29	By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	30	By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	31	By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	32	What more shall I say?  For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	33	who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,{Daniel 6:22-23}	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire,{Daniel 3:1-30} escaped the edge of the sword,{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead by resurrection.{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	36	Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned.{2 Chronicles 24:20-21} They were sawn apart. They were tempted.  They were slain with the sword.{Jeremiah 26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10} They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	38	(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	39	These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,	10	WEB
Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	1	Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	2	looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	3	For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.{Proverbs 3:11-12}	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure.  God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect.  Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	11	All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	12	Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,{Isaiah 35:3}	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet,{Proverbs 4:26} so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	14	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	15	looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	16	lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	19	the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	20	for they could not stand that which was commanded, If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned{TR adds or shot with an arrow [see Exodus 19:12-13]};{Exodus 19:12-13}	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.{Deuteronomy 9:19}	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,{Jeremiah 31:31} and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	25	See that you don't refuse him who speaks.  For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	26	whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.{Haggai 2:6}	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	27	This phrase, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,	10	WEB
Hebrews	12	29	for our God is a consuming fire.{Deuteronomy 4:24}	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	1	Let brotherly love continue.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	2	Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled:  but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	5	Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you.{Deuteronomy 31:6}	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	6	So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper. I will not fear.  What can man do to me?{Psalm 118:6-7}	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	9	Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.{Leviticus 16:27}	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	13	Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	14	For we don't have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	15	Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God{Psalm 50:23} continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	16	But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	19	I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	20	Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	21	make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	22	But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.	10	WEB
Hebrews	13	24	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.	10	WEB
James	13	25	Grace be with you all.  Amen.	11	WEB
James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion:  Greetings.	11	WEB
James	1	2	Count it all joy, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, when you fall into various temptations,	11	WEB
James	1	3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.	11	WEB
James	1	4	Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.	11	WEB
James	1	5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him.	11	WEB
James	1	6	But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.	11	WEB
James	1	7	For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.	11	WEB
James	1	8	He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.	11	WEB
James	1	9	But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;	11	WEB
James	1	10	and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.	11	WEB
James	1	11	For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes.  So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.	11	WEB
James	1	12	Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.	11	WEB
James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God can't be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.	11	WEB
James	1	14	But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.	11	WEB
James	1	15	Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.	11	WEB
James	1	16	Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.	11	WEB
James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.	11	WEB
James	1	18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.	11	WEB
James	1	19	So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;	11	WEB
James	1	20	for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.	11	WEB
James	1	21	Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls{or, preserve your life.}.	11	WEB
James	1	22	But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.	11	WEB
James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;	11	WEB
James	1	24	for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.	11	WEB
James	1	25	But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.	11	WEB
James	1	26	If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless.	11	WEB
James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.	11	WEB
James	2	1	My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.	11	WEB
James	2	2	For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue{or, meeting}, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;	11	WEB
James	2	3	and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, Sit here in a good place; and you tell the poor man, Stand there, or Sit by my footstool;	11	WEB
James	2	4	haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?	11	WEB
James	2	5	Listen, my beloved brothers.  Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?	11	WEB
James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man.  Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?	11	WEB
James	2	7	Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?	11	WEB
James	2	8	However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself,{Leviticus 19:18} you do well.	11	WEB
James	2	9	But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.	11	WEB
James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.	11	WEB
James	2	11	For he who said, Do not commit adultery,{Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18} also said, Do not commit murder.{Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17} Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.	11	WEB
James	2	12	So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.	11	WEB
James	2	13	For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.	11	WEB
James	2	14	What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works?  Can faith save him?	11	WEB
James	2	15	And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,	11	WEB
James	2	16	and one of you tells them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs, what good is it?	11	WEB
James	2	17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.	11	WEB
James	2	18	Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.	11	WEB
James	2	19	You believe that God is one.  You do well.  The demons also believe, and shudder.	11	WEB
James	2	20	But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?	11	WEB
James	2	21	Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?	11	WEB
James	2	22	You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;	11	WEB
James	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;{Genesis 15:16} and he was called the friend of God.	11	WEB
James	2	24	You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.	11	WEB
James	2	25	In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?	11	WEB
James	2	26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.	11	WEB
James	3	1	Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.	11	WEB
James	3	2	For in many things we all stumble.  If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.	11	WEB
James	3	3	Indeed, we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.	11	WEB
James	3	4	Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.	11	WEB
James	3	5	So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!	11	WEB
James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire.  The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.{or, Hell}	11	WEB
James	3	7	For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.	11	WEB
James	3	8	But nobody can tame the tongue.  It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.	11	WEB
James	3	9	With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.	11	WEB
James	3	10	Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.	11	WEB
James	3	11	Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?	11	WEB
James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.	11	WEB
James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you?  Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.	11	WEB
James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the truth.	11	WEB
James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.	11	WEB
James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.	11	WEB
James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.	11	WEB
James	3	18	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.	11	WEB
James	4	1	Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members?	11	WEB
James	4	2	You lust, and don't have.  You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war.  You don't have, because you don't ask.	11	WEB
James	4	3	You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.	11	WEB
James	4	4	You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?  Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.	11	WEB
James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously?	11	WEB
James	4	6	But he gives more grace.  Therefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}	11	WEB
James	4	7	Be subject therefore to God.  But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	11	WEB
James	4	8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.  Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.	11	WEB
James	4	9	Lament, mourn, and weep.  Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.	11	WEB
James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.	11	WEB
James	4	11	Don't speak against one another, brothers.  He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law.  But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.	11	WEB
James	4	12	Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?	11	WEB
James	4	13	Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.	11	WEB
James	4	14	Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life?  For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.	11	WEB
James	4	15	For you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.	11	WEB
James	4	16	But now you glory in your boasting.  All such boasting is evil.	11	WEB
James	4	17	To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.	11	WEB
James	5	1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.	11	WEB
James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.	11	WEB
James	5	3	Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days.	11	WEB
James	5	4	Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)}.	11	WEB
James	5	5	You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.	11	WEB
James	5	6	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn't resist you.	11	WEB
James	5	7	Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain.	11	WEB
James	5	8	You also be patient.  Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.	11	WEB
James	5	9	Don't grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won't be judged.  Behold, the judge stands at the door.	11	WEB
James	5	10	Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.	11	WEB
James	5	11	Behold, we call them blessed who endured.  You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.	11	WEB
James	5	12	But above all things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no; so that you don't fall into hypocrisy.{TR reads under judgment instead of into hypocrisy}	11	WEB
James	5	13	Is any among you suffering?  Let him pray.  Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises.	11	WEB
James	5	14	Is any among you sick?  Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,	11	WEB
James	5	15	and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.  If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.	11	WEB
James	5	16	Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.  The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.	11	WEB
James	5	17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months.	11	WEB
James	5	18	He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.	11	WEB
James	5	19	Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,	11	WEB
1 John	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and forever.  Amen.	12	WEB
1 John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life	12	WEB
1 John	1	2	(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);	12	WEB
1 John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us.  Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.	12	WEB
1 John	1	4	And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.	12	WEB
1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	12	WEB
1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.	12	WEB
1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.	12	WEB
1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	12	WEB
1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	12	WEB
1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	12	WEB
1 John	2	1	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.  If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.	12	WEB
1 John	2	2	And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.	12	WEB
1 John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.	12	WEB
1 John	2	4	One who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.	12	WEB
1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him.  This is how we know that we are in him:	12	WEB
1 John	2	6	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.	12	WEB
1 John	2	7	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.	12	WEB
1 John	2	8	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.	12	WEB
1 John	2	9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.	12	WEB
1 John	2	10	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.	12	WEB
1 John	2	11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.	12	WEB
1 John	2	12	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.	12	WEB
1 John	2	13	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.	12	WEB
1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.	12	WEB
1 John	2	15	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.	12	WEB
1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.	12	WEB
1 John	2	17	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.	12	WEB
1 John	2	18	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.	12	WEB
1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.	12	WEB
1 John	2	20	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.	12	WEB
1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.	12	WEB
1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.	12	WEB
1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.	12	WEB
1 John	2	24	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning.  If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.	12	WEB
1 John	2	25	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.	12	WEB
1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.	12	WEB
1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.	12	WEB
1 John	2	28	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	12	WEB
1 John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.	12	WEB
1 John	3	1	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!  For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.	12	WEB
1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be.  But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.	12	WEB
1 John	3	3	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.	12	WEB
1 John	3	4	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.	12	WEB
1 John	3	5	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.	12	WEB
1 John	3	6	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.	12	WEB
1 John	3	7	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.	12	WEB
1 John	3	8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	12	WEB
1 John	3	9	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.	12	WEB
1 John	3	10	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.  Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.	12	WEB
1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;	12	WEB
1 John	3	12	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him?  Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.	12	WEB
1 John	3	13	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.	12	WEB
1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.  He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.	12	WEB
1 John	3	15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.	12	WEB
1 John	3	16	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.	12	WEB
1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?	12	WEB
1 John	3	18	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.	12	WEB
1 John	3	19	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,	12	WEB
1 John	3	20	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.	12	WEB
1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;	12	WEB
1 John	3	22	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.	12	WEB
1 John	3	23	This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.	12	WEB
1 John	3	24	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.	12	WEB
1 John	4	1	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.	12	WEB
1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,	12	WEB
1 John	4	3	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.	12	WEB
1 John	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.	12	WEB
1 John	4	5	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.	12	WEB
1 John	4	6	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	12	WEB
1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.	12	WEB
1 John	4	8	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.	12	WEB
1 John	4	9	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.	12	WEB
1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins.	12	WEB
1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.	12	WEB
1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.	12	WEB
1 John	4	13	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.	12	WEB
1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.	12	WEB
1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.	12	WEB
1 John	4	16	We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.	12	WEB
1 John	4	17	In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.	12	WEB
1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made perfect in love.	12	WEB
1 John	4	19	We love Him, because he first loved us.	12	WEB
1 John	4	20	If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?	12	WEB
1 John	4	21	This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.	12	WEB
1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him.	12	WEB
1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.	12	WEB
1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.	12	WEB
1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world:  your faith.	12	WEB
1 John	5	5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	12	WEB
1 John	5	6	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.	12	WEB
1 John	5	7	For there are three who testify{Only a few recent manuscripts add in heaven:  the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.  And there are three that testify on earth}:	12	WEB
1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.	12	WEB
1 John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.	12	WEB
1 John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.	12	WEB
1 John	5	11	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	12	WEB
1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life.  He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.	12	WEB
1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.	12	WEB
1 John	5	14	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.	12	WEB
1 John	5	15	And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.	12	WEB
1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.	12	WEB
1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.	12	WEB
1 John	5	18	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.	12	WEB
1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.	12	WEB
1 John	5	20	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	12	WEB
Philemon	3	15	All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.  Amen.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	2	to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:	13	WEB
Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	5	hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;	13	WEB
Philemon	1	6	that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	7	For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	8	Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	9	yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	10	I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,{Onesimus means useful.}	13	WEB
Philemon	1	11	who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back.  Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	13	whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	14	But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	17	If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	18	But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand:  I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).	13	WEB
Philemon	1	20	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	22	Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.	13	WEB
Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,	13	WEB
Philemon	1	24	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.	13	WEB
Philippians	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.  Amen.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers{or, superintendents, or bishops} and servants{Or, deacons}:	14	WEB
Philippians	1	2	Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	3	I thank my God whenever I remember you,	14	WEB
Philippians	1	4	always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,	14	WEB
Philippians	1	5	for your partnership{The word translated partnership (koinonia) also means fellowship and sharing.} in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	7	It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	9	This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	10	so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	12	Now I desire to have you know, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	13	so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	14	and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	16	The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	17	but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	18	What does it matter?  Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	19	For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	14	WEB
Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	22	But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't make known what I will choose.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	23	But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	24	Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	25	Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,	14	WEB
Philippians	1	26	that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	27	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;	14	WEB
Philippians	1	28	and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.	14	WEB
Philippians	1	29	Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,	14	WEB
Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	1	If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	2	make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;	14	WEB
Philippians	2	3	doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;	14	WEB
Philippians	2	4	each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	5	Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	6	who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	8	And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	9	Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;	14	WEB
Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	12	So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	13	For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputes,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	15	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	16	holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	17	Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	18	In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	21	For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	22	But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	25	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;	14	WEB
Philippians	2	26	since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	14	WEB
Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,	14	WEB
Philippians	2	30	because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;	14	WEB
Philippians	3	4	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:	14	WEB
Philippians	3	5	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;	14	WEB
Philippians	3	6	concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	7	However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	8	Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ	14	WEB
Philippians	3	9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;	14	WEB
Philippians	3	10	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;	14	WEB
Philippians	3	11	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	13	Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do.  Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,	14	WEB
Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.  Let us be of the same mind.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	17	Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,	14	WEB
Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.	14	WEB
Philippians	3	20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;	14	WEB
Philippians	3	21	who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	2	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	3	Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again I will say, Rejoice!	14	WEB
Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness be known to all men.  The Lord is at hand.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	6	In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	8	Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	9	The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	10	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	12	I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	14	However you did well that you shared in my affliction.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	18	But I have all things, and abound.  I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	19	My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!  Amen.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.  The brothers who are with me greet you.	14	WEB
Philippians	4	22	All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.	14	WEB

Psalms	78	21	Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,	15	WEB
Psalms	78	22	because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	23	Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	24	He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.	15	WEB

Psalms	78	29	So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	30	They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet in their mouths,	15	WEB
Psalms	78	31	when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	32	For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	33	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.	15	WEB

Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.	15	WEB

Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	38	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!	15	WEB
Psalms	78	41	They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	42	They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;	15	WEB
Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,	15	WEB
Psalms	78	44	he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	48	He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	49	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	50	He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,	15	WEB
Psalms	78	51	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	52	But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	53	He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	54	He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	55	He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;	15	WEB
Psalms	78	57	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;	15	WEB
Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;	15	WEB
Psalms	78	61	and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	62	He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	66	He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to a perpetual reproach.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	67	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,	15	WEB
Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	69	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	70	He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;	15	WEB
Psalms	78	71	from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.	15	WEB
Psalms	78	72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	1	<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	2	They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	3	Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	5	How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy burn like fire?	15	WEB
Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;	15	WEB
Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	8	Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.	15	WEB
Psalms	79	9	Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.	15	WEB

Psalms	79	13	So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.	15	WEB

Psalms	80	9	You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root, and filled the land.	15	WEB
Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were like God's cedars.	15	WEB
Psalms	80	11	It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.	15	WEB
Psalms	80	12	Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?	15	WEB

Romans	1	1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,	16	WEB
Romans	1	2	which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,	16	WEB
Romans	1	3	concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,	16	WEB
Romans	1	4	who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,	16	WEB
Romans	1	5	through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;	16	WEB
Romans	1	6	among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;	16	WEB
Romans	1	7	to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.	16	WEB
Romans	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,	16	WEB
Romans	1	10	requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.	16	WEB
Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;	16	WEB
Romans	1	12	that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.	16	WEB
Romans	1	13	Now I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.	16	WEB
Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.	16	WEB
Romans	1	15	So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.	16	WEB
Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.	16	WEB
Romans	1	17	For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}	16	WEB
Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,	16	WEB
Romans	1	19	because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.	16	WEB
Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.	16	WEB
Romans	1	21	Because, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.	16	WEB
Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,	16	WEB
Romans	1	23	and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.	16	WEB
Romans	1	24	Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,	16	WEB
Romans	1	25	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.  Amen.	16	WEB
Romans	1	26	For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.	16	WEB
Romans	1	27	Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.	16	WEB
Romans	1	28	Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;	16	WEB
Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,	16	WEB
Romans	1	30	backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,	16	WEB
Romans	1	31	without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;	16	WEB
Romans	1	32	who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.	16	WEB
Romans	2	1	Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.	16	WEB
Romans	2	2	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.	16	WEB
Romans	2	3	Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?	16	WEB
Romans	2	4	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?	16	WEB
Romans	2	5	But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;	16	WEB
Romans	2	6	who will pay back to everyone according to their works:{Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12}	16	WEB
Romans	2	7	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;	16	WEB
Romans	2	8	but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,	16	WEB
Romans	2	9	oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	16	WEB
Romans	2	10	But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	16	WEB
Romans	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.	16	WEB
Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law.  As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.	16	WEB
Romans	2	13	For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified	16	WEB
Romans	2	14	(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,	16	WEB
Romans	2	15	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)	16	WEB
Romans	2	16	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	2	17	Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,	16	WEB
Romans	2	18	and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,	16	WEB
Romans	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,	16	WEB
Romans	2	20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.	16	WEB
Romans	2	21	You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?	16	WEB
Romans	2	22	You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery.  Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?	16	WEB
Romans	2	23	You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?	16	WEB
Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,{Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22} just as it is written.	16	WEB
Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.	16	WEB
Romans	2	26	If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?	16	WEB
Romans	2	27	Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?	16	WEB
Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;	16	WEB
Romans	2	29	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.	16	WEB
Romans	3	1	Then what advantage does the Jew have?  Or what is the profit of circumcision?	16	WEB
Romans	3	2	Much in every way!  Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.	16	WEB
Romans	3	3	For what if some were without faith?  Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?	16	WEB
Romans	3	4	May it never be!  Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment.{Psalm 51:4}	16	WEB
Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say?  Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.	16	WEB
Romans	3	6	May it never be!  For then how will God judge the world?	16	WEB
Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?	16	WEB
Romans	3	8	Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Those who say so are justly condemned.	16	WEB
Romans	3	9	What then?  Are we better than they?  No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.	16	WEB
Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is no one righteous; no, not one.	16	WEB
Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands.  There is no one who seeks after God.	16	WEB
Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside.  They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one.{Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Ecclesiastes 7:20}	16	WEB
Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open tomb.  With their tongues they have used deceit.{Psalm 5:9} The poison of vipers is under their lips;{Psalm 140:3}	16	WEB
Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.{Psalm 10:7}	16	WEB
Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood.	16	WEB
Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways.	16	WEB
Romans	3	17	The way of peace, they haven't known.{Isaiah 59:7-8}	16	WEB
Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.{Psalm 36:1}	16	WEB
Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.	16	WEB
Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight.  For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.	16	WEB
Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;	16	WEB
Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe.  For there is no distinction,	16	WEB
Romans	3	23	for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;	16	WEB
Romans	3	24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;	16	WEB
Romans	3	25	whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice{or, a propitiation}, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;	16	WEB
Romans	3	26	to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.	16	WEB
Romans	3	27	Where then is the boasting?  It is excluded.  By what manner of law? Of works?  No, but by a law of faith.	16	WEB
Romans	3	28	We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.	16	WEB
Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only?  Isn't he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,	16	WEB
Romans	3	30	since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.	16	WEB
Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify the law through faith?  May it never be! No, we establish the law.	16	WEB
Romans	4	1	What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?	16	WEB
Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.	16	WEB
Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say?  Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}	16	WEB
Romans	4	4	Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt.	16	WEB
Romans	4	5	But to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	4	6	Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,	16	WEB
Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.	16	WEB
Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.{Psalm 32:1-2}	16	WEB
Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also?  For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	4	10	How then was it counted?  When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?  Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	16	WEB
Romans	4	11	He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.	16	WEB
Romans	4	12	The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.	16	WEB
Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.	16	WEB
Romans	4	14	For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.	16	WEB
Romans	4	15	For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.	16	WEB
Romans	4	16	For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.	16	WEB
Romans	4	17	As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations.{Genesis 17:5} This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.	16	WEB
Romans	4	18	Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So will your seed be.{Genesis 15:5}	16	WEB
Romans	4	19	Without being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.	16	WEB
Romans	4	20	Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,	16	WEB
Romans	4	21	and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.	16	WEB
Romans	4	22	Therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}	16	WEB
Romans	4	23	Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,	16	WEB
Romans	4	24	but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,	16	WEB
Romans	4	25	who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.	16	WEB
Romans	5	1	Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;	16	WEB
Romans	5	2	through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand.  We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.	16	WEB
Romans	5	3	Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;	16	WEB
Romans	5	4	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:	16	WEB
Romans	5	5	and hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.	16	WEB
Romans	5	6	For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.	16	WEB
Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man.  Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.	16	WEB
Romans	5	8	But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	16	WEB
Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him.	16	WEB
Romans	5	10	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.	16	WEB
Romans	5	11	Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.	16	WEB
Romans	5	12	Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.	16	WEB
Romans	5	13	For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.	16	WEB
Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.	16	WEB
Romans	5	15	But the free gift isn't like the trespass.  For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.	16	WEB
Romans	5	16	The gift is not as through one who sinned:  for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.	16	WEB
Romans	5	17	For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	5	18	So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.	16	WEB
Romans	5	19	For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.	16	WEB
Romans	5	20	The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;	16	WEB
Romans	5	21	that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	16	WEB
Romans	6	1	What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	16	WEB
Romans	6	2	May it never be!  We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?	16	WEB
Romans	6	3	Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?	16	WEB
Romans	6	4	We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.	16	WEB
Romans	6	5	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;	16	WEB
Romans	6	6	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.	16	WEB
Romans	6	7	For he who has died has been freed from sin.	16	WEB
Romans	6	8	But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;	16	WEB
Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!	16	WEB
Romans	6	10	For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.	16	WEB
Romans	6	11	Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.	16	WEB
Romans	6	12	Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.	16	WEB
Romans	6	13	Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.	16	WEB
Romans	6	14	For sin will not have dominion over you.  For you are not under law, but under grace.	16	WEB
Romans	6	15	What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?  May it never be!	16	WEB
Romans	6	16	Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?	16	WEB
Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.	16	WEB
Romans	6	18	Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	6	19	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.	16	WEB
Romans	6	20	For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	6	21	What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed?  For the end of those things is death.	16	WEB
Romans	6	22	But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.	16	WEB
Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.	16	WEB
Romans	7	1	Or don't you know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?	16	WEB
Romans	7	2	For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.	16	WEB
Romans	7	3	So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress.  But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.	16	WEB
Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.	16	WEB
Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.	16	WEB
Romans	7	6	But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.	16	WEB
Romans	7	7	What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, You shall not covet.{Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21}	16	WEB
Romans	7	8	But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting.  For apart from the law, sin is dead.	16	WEB
Romans	7	9	I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.	16	WEB
Romans	7	10	The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;	16	WEB
Romans	7	11	for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.	16	WEB
Romans	7	12	Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.	16	WEB
Romans	7	13	Did then that which is good become death to me?  May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.	16	WEB
Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.	16	WEB
Romans	7	15	For I don't know what I am doing.  For I don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.	16	WEB
Romans	7	16	But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.	16	WEB
Romans	7	17	So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.	16	WEB
Romans	7	18	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing that which is good.	16	WEB
Romans	7	19	For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice.	16	WEB
Romans	7	20	But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.	16	WEB
Romans	7	21	I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.	16	WEB
Romans	7	22	For I delight in God's law after the inward man,	16	WEB
Romans	7	23	but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.	16	WEB
Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am!  Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?	16	WEB
Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!  So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.	16	WEB
Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.{NU omits who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit}	16	WEB
Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.	16	WEB
Romans	8	3	For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;	16	WEB
Romans	8	4	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	16	WEB
Romans	8	5	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.	16	WEB
Romans	8	6	For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;	16	WEB
Romans	8	7	because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be.	16	WEB
Romans	8	8	Those who are in the flesh can't please God.	16	WEB
Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you.  But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.	16	WEB
Romans	8	10	If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.	16	WEB
Romans	8	12	So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.	16	WEB
Romans	8	13	For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.	16	WEB
Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.	16	WEB
Romans	8	15	For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba{Abba is an Aramaic word for father or daddy, often used affectionately and respectfully in prayer to our Father in heaven.}!  Father!	16	WEB
Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;	16	WEB
Romans	8	17	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.	16	WEB
Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.	16	WEB
Romans	8	19	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.	16	WEB
Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope	16	WEB
Romans	8	21	that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.	16	WEB
Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.	16	WEB
Romans	8	23	Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.	16	WEB
Romans	8	24	For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?	16	WEB
Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for it with patience.	16	WEB
Romans	8	26	In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought.  But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.	16	WEB
Romans	8	27	He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.	16	WEB
Romans	8	28	We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.	16	WEB
Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}	16	WEB
Romans	8	30	Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified.  Whom he justified, those he also glorified.	16	WEB
Romans	8	31	What then shall we say about these things?  If God is for us, who can be against us?	16	WEB
Romans	8	32	He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?	16	WEB
Romans	8	33	Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.	16	WEB
Romans	8	34	Who is he who condemns?  It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.	16	WEB
Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	16	WEB
Romans	8	36	Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.{Psalm 44:22}	16	WEB
Romans	8	37	No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.	16	WEB
Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,	16	WEB
Romans	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	16	WEB
Romans	9	1	I tell the truth in Christ.  I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,	16	WEB
Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.	16	WEB
Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,	16	WEB
Romans	9	4	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;	16	WEB
Romans	9	5	of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever.  Amen.	16	WEB
Romans	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.	16	WEB
Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, In Isaac will your seed be called.{Genesis 21:12}	16	WEB
Romans	9	8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.	16	WEB
Romans	9	9	For this is a word of promise, At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.{Genesis 18:10,14}	16	WEB
Romans	9	10	Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.	16	WEB
Romans	9	11	For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,	16	WEB
Romans	9	12	it was said to her, The elder will serve the younger.{Genesis 25:23}	16	WEB
Romans	9	13	Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.{Malachi 1:2-3}	16	WEB
Romans	9	14	What shall we say then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  May it never be!	16	WEB
Romans	9	15	For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.{Exodus 33:19}	16	WEB
Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.	16	WEB
Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.{Exodus 9:16}	16	WEB
Romans	9	18	So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.	16	WEB
Romans	9	19	You will say then to me, Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?	16	WEB
Romans	9	20	But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God?  Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, Why did you make me like this?{Isaiah 29:16; 45:9}	16	WEB
Romans	9	21	Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?	16	WEB
Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,	16	WEB
Romans	9	23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,	16	WEB
Romans	9	24	us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?	16	WEB
Romans	9	25	As he says also in Hosea, I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people; and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved.{Hosea 2:23}	16	WEB
Romans	9	26	It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' There they will be called 'children of the living God.'{Hosea 1:10}	16	WEB
Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;	16	WEB
Romans	9	28	for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.{Isaiah 10:22-23}	16	WEB
Romans	9	29	As Isaiah has said before, Unless the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)} had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.{Isaiah 1:9}	16	WEB
Romans	9	30	What shall we say then?  That the Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;	16	WEB
Romans	9	31	but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness.	16	WEB
Romans	9	32	Why?  Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law.  They stumbled over the stumbling stone;	16	WEB
Romans	9	33	even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.{Isaiah 8:14; 28:16}	16	WEB
Romans	10	1	Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.	16	WEB
Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.	16	WEB
Romans	10	3	For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.	16	WEB
Romans	10	4	For Christ is the fulfillment{or, completion, or end} of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.	16	WEB
Romans	10	5	For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, The one who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}	16	WEB
Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith says this, Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'{Deuteronomy 30:12} (that is, to bring Christ down);	16	WEB
Romans	10	7	or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'{Deuteronomy 30:13} (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)	16	WEB
Romans	10	8	But what does it say?  The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;{Deuteronomy 30:14} that is, the word of faith, which we preach:	16	WEB
Romans	10	9	that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.	16	WEB
Romans	10	10	For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	16	WEB
Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says, Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}	16	WEB
Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.	16	WEB
Romans	10	13	For, Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.{Joel 2:32}	16	WEB
Romans	10	14	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?	16	WEB
Romans	10	15	And how will they preach unless they are sent?  As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!{Isaiah 52:7}	16	WEB
Romans	10	16	But they didn't all listen to the glad news.  For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?{Isaiah 53:1}	16	WEB
Romans	10	17	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	16	WEB
Romans	10	18	But I say, didn't they hear?  Yes, most certainly, Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.{Psalm 19:4}	16	WEB
Romans	10	19	But I ask, didn't Israel know?  First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.{Deuteronomy 32:31}	16	WEB
Romans	10	20	Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found by those who didn't seek me.  I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me.{Isaiah 65:1}	16	WEB
Romans	10	21	But as to Israel he says, All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.{Isaiah 65:2}	16	WEB
Romans	11	1	I ask then, did God reject his people?  May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	16	WEB
Romans	11	2	God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew.  Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah?  How he pleads with God against Israel:	16	WEB
Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.{1 Kings 19:10,14}	16	WEB
Romans	11	4	But how does God answer him?  I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.{1 Kings 19:18}	16	WEB
Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.	16	WEB
Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.  But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.	16	WEB
Romans	11	7	What then?  That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.	16	WEB
Romans	11	8	According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.{Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10}	16	WEB
Romans	11	9	David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.	16	WEB
Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always.{Psalm 69:22,23}	16	WEB
Romans	11	11	I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?  May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.	16	WEB
Romans	11	12	Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?	16	WEB
Romans	11	13	For I speak to you who are Gentiles.  Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;	16	WEB
Romans	11	14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.	16	WEB
Romans	11	15	For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?	16	WEB
Romans	11	16	If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump.  If the root is holy, so are the branches.	16	WEB
Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;	16	WEB
Romans	11	18	don't boast over the branches.  But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.	16	WEB
Romans	11	19	You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.	16	WEB
Romans	11	20	True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith.  Don't be conceited, but fear;	16	WEB
Romans	11	21	for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.	16	WEB
Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and severity of God.  Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.	16	WEB
Romans	11	23	They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.	16	WEB
Romans	11	24	For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?	16	WEB
Romans	11	25	For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,	16	WEB
Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved.  Even as it is written, There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.	16	WEB
Romans	11	27	This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins.{Isaiah 59:20-21; 27:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34}	16	WEB
Romans	11	28	Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.	16	WEB
Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.	16	WEB
Romans	11	30	For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,	16	WEB
Romans	11	31	even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.	16	WEB
Romans	11	32	For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.	16	WEB
Romans	11	33	Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!	16	WEB
Romans	11	34	For who has known the mind of the Lord?  Or who has been his counselor?{Isaiah 40:13}	16	WEB
Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?{Job 41:11}	16	WEB
Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever!  Amen.	16	WEB
Romans	12	1	Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.	16	WEB
Romans	12	2	Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.	16	WEB
Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.	16	WEB
Romans	12	4	For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,	16	WEB
Romans	12	5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.	16	WEB
Romans	12	6	Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;	16	WEB
Romans	12	7	or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;	16	WEB
Romans	12	8	or he who exhorts, to his exhorting:  he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.	16	WEB
Romans	12	9	Let love be without hypocrisy.  Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.	16	WEB
Romans	12	10	In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;	16	WEB
Romans	12	11	not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;	16	WEB
Romans	12	12	rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;	16	WEB
Romans	12	13	contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.	16	WEB
Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.	16	WEB
Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice.  Weep with those who weep.	16	WEB
Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another.  Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.	16	WEB
Romans	12	17	Repay no one evil for evil.  Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.	16	WEB
Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.	16	WEB
Romans	12	19	Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath.  For it is written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.{Deuteronomy 32:35}	16	WEB
Romans	12	20	Therefore If your enemy is hungry, feed him.  If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.{Proverbs 25:21-22}	16	WEB
Romans	12	21	Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.	16	WEB
Romans	13	1	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.	16	WEB
Romans	13	2	Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.	16	WEB
Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,	16	WEB
Romans	13	4	for he is a servant of God to you for good.  But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.	16	WEB
Romans	13	5	Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.	16	WEB
Romans	13	6	For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.	16	WEB
Romans	13	7	Give therefore to everyone what you owe:  taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.	16	WEB
Romans	13	8	Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.	16	WEB
Romans	13	9	For the commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not give false testimony, You shall not covet,{TR adds You shall not give false testimony,}{Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deuteronomy 5:17-19,21} and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}	16	WEB
Romans	13	10	Love doesn't harm a neighbor.  Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.	16	WEB
Romans	13	11	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.	16	WEB
Romans	13	12	The night is far gone, and the day is near.  Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.	16	WEB
Romans	13	13	Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.	16	WEB
Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.	16	WEB
Romans	14	1	Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.	16	WEB
Romans	14	2	One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.	16	WEB
Romans	14	3	Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.	16	WEB
Romans	14	4	Who are you who judge another's servant?  To his own lord he stands or falls.  Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.	16	WEB
Romans	14	5	One man esteems one day as more important.  Another esteems every day alike.  Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.	16	WEB
Romans	14	6	He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks.	16	WEB
Romans	14	7	For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.	16	WEB
Romans	14	8	For if we live, we live to the Lord.  Or if we die, we die to the Lord.  If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.	16	WEB
Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.	16	WEB
Romans	14	10	But you, why do you judge your brother?  Or you again, why do you despise your brother?  For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	14	11	For it is written, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will bow.  Every tongue will confess to God.'{Isaiah 45:23}	16	WEB
Romans	14	12	So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.	16	WEB
Romans	14	13	Therefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling.	16	WEB
Romans	14	14	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.	16	WEB
Romans	14	15	Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love.  Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.	16	WEB
Romans	14	16	Then don't let your good be slandered,	16	WEB
Romans	14	17	for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.	16	WEB
Romans	14	18	For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.	16	WEB
Romans	14	19	So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.	16	WEB
Romans	14	20	Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake.  All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.	16	WEB
Romans	14	21	It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.	16	WEB
Romans	14	22	Do you have faith?  Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves.	16	WEB
Romans	14	23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. (14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.{TR places verses 24-26 after Romans 16:24 as verses 25-27.}	16	WEB
Romans	15	1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.	16	WEB
Romans	15	2	Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.	16	WEB
Romans	15	3	For even Christ didn't please himself.  But, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.{Psalm 69:9}	16	WEB
Romans	15	4	For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.	16	WEB
Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,	16	WEB
Romans	15	6	that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	15	7	Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,{TR reads us instead of you} to the glory of God.	16	WEB
Romans	15	8	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,	16	WEB
Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.{2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 18:49}	16	WEB
Romans	15	10	Again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.{Deuteronomy 32:43}	16	WEB
Romans	15	11	Again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!  Let all the peoples praise him.{Psalm 117:1}	16	WEB
Romans	15	12	Again, Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope.{Isaiah 11:10}	16	WEB
Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.	16	WEB
Romans	15	14	I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.	16	WEB
Romans	15	15	But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,	16	WEB
Romans	15	16	that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.	16	WEB
Romans	15	17	I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.	16	WEB
Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,	16	WEB
Romans	15	19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;	16	WEB
Romans	15	20	yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation.	16	WEB
Romans	15	21	But, as it is written, They will see, to whom no news of him came. They who haven't heard will understand.{Isaiah 52:15}	16	WEB
Romans	15	22	Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,	16	WEB
Romans	15	23	but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,	16	WEB
Romans	15	24	whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.	16	WEB
Romans	15	25	But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.	16	WEB
Romans	15	26	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.	16	WEB
Romans	15	27	Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.	16	WEB
Romans	15	28	When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.	16	WEB
Romans	15	29	I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.	16	WEB
Romans	15	30	Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,	16	WEB
Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;	16	WEB
Romans	15	32	that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.	16	WEB
Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all.  Amen.	16	WEB
Romans	16	1	I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant{or, deacon} of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,	16	WEB
Romans	16	2	that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.	16	WEB
Romans	16	3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,	16	WEB

Ruth	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did that which was right in his own eyes.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	1	It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	3	Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	4	They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	5	Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	7	She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	9	Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	10	They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	11	Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?	17	WEB
Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;	17	WEB
Ruth	1	13	would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh is gone forth against me.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	14	They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	15	She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	16	Ruth said, Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;	17	WEB
Ruth	1	17	where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?	17	WEB
Ruth	1	20	She said to them, Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.	17	WEB
Ruth	1	21	I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?	17	WEB
Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	1	Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	3	She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	4	Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?	17	WEB
Ruth	2	6	The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:	17	WEB
Ruth	2	7	She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?	17	WEB
Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn't know before.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	12	Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	14	At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	15	When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	18	She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	21	Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.	17	WEB
Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	1	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?	17	WEB
Ruth	3	2	Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	3	Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	4	It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	5	She said to her, All that you say I will do.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	6	She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	8	It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	9	He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	10	He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	11	Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	13	Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	14	She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	15	He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	17	She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said, Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.	17	WEB
Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	2	He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here.  They sat down.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	3	He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:	17	WEB
Ruth	4	4	I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	6	The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you; for I can't redeem it.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	7	Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	8	So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	9	Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	11	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:	17	WEB
Ruth	4	12	and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	15	He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	17	The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.	17	WEB
Ruth	4	18	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became the father of Hezron,	17	WEB
Ruth	4	19	and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,	17	WEB
Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,	17	WEB
Ruth	4	21	and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,	17	WEB
2 Corinthians	16	24	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.  Amen.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	4	who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	8	For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	9	Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	11	you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this:  the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	14	as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	16	and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the Yes, yes and the No, no?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not Yes and no.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and no, but in him is Yes.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	20	For however many are the promises of God, in him is the Yes. Therefore also through him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	21	Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	22	who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	23	But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	1	24	Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy.  For you stand firm in faith.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	5	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	7	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	9	For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	10	Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	11	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	13	I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	16	to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life.  Who is sufficient for these things?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	3	being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	4	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit.  For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	7	But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	8	won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	9	For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	10	For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	11	For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	13	and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	15	But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	16	But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	2	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	3	Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	4	in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	5	For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	6	seeing it is God who said, Light will shine out of darkness,{Genesis 1:3} who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	8	We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	9	pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	10	always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	12	So then death works in us, but life in you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore I spoke.{Psalm 116:10} We also believe, and therefore also we speak;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	14	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	4	18	while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	2	For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	3	if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	5	Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith, not by sight.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	8	We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	12	For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God.  Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	15	He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	16	Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away.  Behold, all things have become new.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	19	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	20	We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us.  We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	5	21	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	1	Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	2	for he says, At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.{Isaiah 49:8} Behold, now is the acceptable time.  Behold, now is the day of salvation.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	3	We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	4	but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	6	in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	7	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	8	by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	9	as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians.  Our heart is enlarged.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	12	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	13	Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	14	Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity?  Or what communion has light with darkness?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	15	What agreement has Christ with Belial?  Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	16	What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God.  Even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.{Leviticus 26:12; Jeremiah 32:38; Ezekiel 37:27}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	17	Therefore, 'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord.  'Touch no unclean thing.  I will receive you.{Isaiah 52:11; Ezekiel 20:34,41}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	6	18	I will be to you a Father.  You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty.{2 Samuel 7:14; 7:8}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	2	Open your hearts to us.  We wronged no one.  We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	3	I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you.  Great is my boasting on your behalf.  I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	5	For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side.  Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	7	and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it.  For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance.  For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret.  But the sorrow of the world works death.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	11	For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we have been comforted.  In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed.  But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	15	His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	2	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	4	begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	5	This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	7	But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	10	I give a judgment in this:  for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	11	But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	13	For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	14	but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.{Exodus 16:8}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	17	For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	18	We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	19	Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	20	We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	21	Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	1	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	2	for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	4	so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	5	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	6	Remember this:  he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	7	Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	9	As it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.{Psalm 112:9}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	10	Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	11	you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	12	For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	13	seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	14	while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	9	15	Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	2	Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	4	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	5	throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	6	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	7	Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	10	For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves.  But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	14	For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you.  For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	15	not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	16	so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	17	But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	10	18	For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	1	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	4	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	5	For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	6	But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge.  No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	9	When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need.  In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	11	Why?  Because I don't love you?  God knows.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	15	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	16	I say again, let no one think me foolish.  But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	19	For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	20	For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	21	I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews?  So am I. Are they Israelites?  So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham?  So am I.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ?  (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods.  Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck.  I have been a night and a day in the deep.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	26	I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	27	in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	11	33	Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	1	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	3	I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows),	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	4	how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	6	For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth.  But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	7	By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	9	He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	11	I have become foolish in boasting.  You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	13	For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	14	Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you.  For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	16	But be it so, I did not myself burden you.  But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	18	I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.  Did Titus take any advantage of you?  Didn't we walk in the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps?	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	19	Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ.  But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	12	21	that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you.  At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word established.{Deuteronomy 19:15}	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	2	I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	3	seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	4	For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God.  For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	5	Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves.  Or don't you know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you are disqualified.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	6	But I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	10	For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brothers, rejoice.  Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.	18	WEB
2 Corinthians	13	13	All the saints greet you.	18	WEB
2 John	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.	19	WEB
2 John	1	1	The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;	19	WEB
2 John	1	2	for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:	19	WEB
2 John	1	3	Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	19	WEB
2 John	1	4	I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.	19	WEB
2 John	1	5	Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	19	WEB
2 John	1	6	This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.	19	WEB
2 John	1	7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.	19	WEB
2 John	1	8	Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.	19	WEB
2 John	1	9	Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God.  He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.	19	WEB
2 John	1	10	If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,	19	WEB
2 John	1	11	for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.	19	WEB
2 John	1	12	Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.	19	WEB
2 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.  Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	2	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	3	seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	4	by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	5	Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	6	and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	7	and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	8	For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} be more diligent to make your calling and election sure.  For if you do these things, you will never stumble.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	11	For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	12	Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	13	I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	14	knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	15	Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.{Matthew 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35}	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	18	We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	19	We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	20	knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.	20	WEB
2 Peter	1	21	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man:  but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	1	But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	2	Many will follow their immoral{TR reads destructive instead of immoral} ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	3	In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old doesn't linger, and their destruction will not slumber.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	4	For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus{Tartarus is another name for Hell}, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	5	and didn't spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	6	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	7	and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds):	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	9	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	10	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority.  Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	11	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	12	But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	13	receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	15	forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrong-doing;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	16	but he was rebuked for his own disobedience.  A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	18	For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	19	promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	20	For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	21	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.	20	WEB
2 Peter	2	22	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns to his own vomit again,{Proverbs 26:11} and the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	1	This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	2	that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior:	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	3	knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming?  For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	5	For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	6	by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	7	But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	8	But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	11	Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	12	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	13	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	15	Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	16	as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.	20	WEB
2 Peter	3	17	You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.	20	WEB
2 Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	5	This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	6	Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	8	giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	9	who will pay the penalty:  eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	10	when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	11	To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	1	12	that the name of our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	1	Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	2	not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one deceive you in any way.  For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	4	he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	5	Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	6	Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness already works.  Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	9	even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	10	and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn't receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	11	Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	12	that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	14	to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	15	So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	1	Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you know how you ought to imitate us.  For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you,	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	8	neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	9	not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't work at all, but are busybodies.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	12	Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	13	But you, brothers, don't be weary in doing well.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	14	If any man doesn't obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	15	Don't count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways.  The Lord be with you all.	21	WEB
2 Thessalonians	3	17	The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter:  this is how I write.	21	WEB
2 Timothy	6	21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.  Amen.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	3	I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience.  How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	4	longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	5	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	6	For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	7	For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	8	Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	9	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	10	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	11	For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	12	For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	13	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	15	This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	16	May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	17	but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me	22	WEB
2 Timothy	1	18	(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	1	You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	2	The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	3	You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	4	No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	5	Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	6	The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	9	in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	11	This saying is faithful:  For if we died with him, we will also live with him.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	12	If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him, he also will deny us.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	15	Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	16	But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	17	and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	18	men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	19	However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his,{Numbers 16:5} and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads Christ instead of the Lord} depart from unrighteousness.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay.  Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	21	If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	22	Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	23	But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	24	The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	25	in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	2	26	and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	1	But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	3	without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	4	traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	5	holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	6	For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	7	always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	8	Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	9	But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	10	But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	11	persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.  I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	12	Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	13	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	14	But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	15	From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	16	Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	1	I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	2	preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	4	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	5	But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	6	For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	8	From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	9	Be diligent to come to me soon,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	10	for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	12	But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	13	Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	15	of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	16	At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	18	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.	22	WEB
2 Timothy	4	21	Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.	22	WEB
3 John	1	13	The children of your chosen sister greet you.  Amen.	23	WEB
3 John	1	1	The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.	23	WEB
3 John	1	2	Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.	23	WEB
3 John	1	3	For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth.	23	WEB
3 John	1	4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth.	23	WEB
3 John	1	5	Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.	23	WEB
3 John	1	6	They have testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God,	23	WEB
3 John	1	7	because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.	23	WEB
3 John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.	23	WEB
3 John	1	9	I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept what we say.	23	WEB
3 John	1	10	Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly.	23	WEB
3 John	1	11	Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God.  He who does evil hasn't seen God.	23	WEB
3 John	1	12	Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.	23	WEB
3 John	1	13	I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;	23	WEB
Titus	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be with you.  Amen.	24	WEB
Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,	24	WEB
Titus	1	2	in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;	24	WEB
Titus	1	3	but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;	24	WEB
Titus	1	4	to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.	24	WEB
Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;	24	WEB
Titus	1	6	if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.	24	WEB
Titus	1	7	For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;	24	WEB
Titus	1	8	but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;	24	WEB
Titus	1	9	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.	24	WEB
Titus	1	10	For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,	24	WEB
Titus	1	11	whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.	24	WEB
Titus	1	12	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.	24	WEB
Titus	1	13	This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,	24	WEB
Titus	1	14	not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.	24	WEB
Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.	24	WEB
Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.	24	WEB
Titus	2	1	But say the things which fit sound doctrine,	24	WEB
Titus	2	2	that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:	24	WEB
Titus	2	3	and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;	24	WEB
Titus	2	4	that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,	24	WEB
Titus	2	5	to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.	24	WEB
Titus	2	6	Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;	24	WEB
Titus	2	7	in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,	24	WEB
Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.	24	WEB
Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;	24	WEB
Titus	2	10	not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.	24	WEB
Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,	24	WEB
Titus	2	12	instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;	24	WEB
Titus	2	13	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;	24	WEB
Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.	24	WEB
Titus	2	15	Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.	24	WEB
Titus	3	1	Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,	24	WEB
Titus	3	2	to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.	24	WEB
Titus	3	3	For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.	24	WEB
Titus	3	4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,	24	WEB
Titus	3	5	not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,	24	WEB
Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;	24	WEB
Titus	3	7	that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	24	WEB
Titus	3	8	This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;	24	WEB
Titus	3	9	but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.	24	WEB
Titus	3	10	Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;	24	WEB
Titus	3	11	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.	24	WEB
Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.	24	WEB
Titus	3	13	Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.	24	WEB
Titus	3	14	Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.	24	WEB
Revelation	1	25	to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever.  Amen.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	1	This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel{or, messenger (here and wherever angel is mentioned)} to his servant, John,	25	WEB
Revelation	1	2	who testified to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.	25	WEB

Revelation	1	11	saying, {TR adds I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last.}What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies{TR adds which are in Asia}: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	12	I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.  Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	13	And among the lampstands was one like a son of man,{Daniel 7:13} clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	14	His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	15	His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace.  His voice was like the voice of many waters.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	16	He had seven stars in his right hand.  Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword.  His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, Don't be afraid. I am the first and the last,	25	WEB
Revelation	1	18	and the Living one.  I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.  Amen.  I have the keys of Death and of Hades{or, Hell}.	25	WEB
Revelation	1	19	Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;	25	WEB
Revelation	1	20	the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands.  The seven stars are the angels{or, messengers (here and wherever angels are mentioned)} of the seven assemblies.  The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	1	To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things:	25	WEB

Revelation	2	3	You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have{TR adds have labored and} not grown weary.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	4	But I have this against you, that you left your first love.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	5	Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	6	But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.	25	WEB

Revelation	2	10	Don't be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.	25	WEB

Revelation	2	13	I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.	25	WEB
Revelation	2	15	So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise{TR reads which I hate instead of likewise}.	25	WEB

Revelation	4	9	When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,	25	WEB

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™  Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.  Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.	25	WEB
