2 Timothy	6	21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.  Amen.	1
2 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,	1
2 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my beloved child:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	1
2 Timothy	1	3	I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience.  How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day	1
2 Timothy	1	4	longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;	1
2 Timothy	1	5	having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.	1
2 Timothy	1	6	For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.	1
2 Timothy	1	7	For God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.	1
2 Timothy	1	8	Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,	1
2 Timothy	1	9	who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,	1
2 Timothy	1	10	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.	1
2 Timothy	1	11	For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.	1
2 Timothy	1	12	For this cause I also suffer these things.  Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.	1
2 Timothy	1	13	Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	1
2 Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.	1
2 Timothy	1	15	This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.	1
2 Timothy	1	16	May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,	1
2 Timothy	1	17	but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me	1
2 Timothy	1	18	(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.	1
2 Timothy	2	1	You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	1
2 Timothy	2	2	The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.	1
2 Timothy	2	3	You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.	1
2 Timothy	2	4	No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.	1
2 Timothy	2	5	Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules.	1
2 Timothy	2	6	The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.	1
2 Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.	1
2 Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,	1
2 Timothy	2	9	in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.	1
2 Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.	1
2 Timothy	2	11	This saying is faithful:  For if we died with him, we will also live with him.	1
2 Timothy	2	12	If we endure, we will also reign with him.  If we deny him, he also will deny us.	1
2 Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless, he remains faithful.  He can't deny himself.	1
2 Timothy	2	14	Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.	1
2 Timothy	2	15	Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.	1
2 Timothy	2	16	But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,	1
2 Timothy	2	17	and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;	1
2 Timothy	2	18	men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.	1
2 Timothy	2	19	However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his,{Numbers 16:5} and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord{TR reads Christ instead of the Lord} depart from unrighteousness.	1
2 Timothy	2	20	Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay.  Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.	1
2 Timothy	2	21	If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work.	1
2 Timothy	2	22	Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	1
2 Timothy	2	23	But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.	1
2 Timothy	2	24	The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,	1
2 Timothy	2	25	in gentleness correcting those who oppose him:  perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,	1
2 Timothy	2	26	and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.	1
2 Timothy	3	1	But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.	1
2 Timothy	3	2	For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,	1
2 Timothy	3	3	without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,	1
2 Timothy	3	4	traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;	1
2 Timothy	3	5	holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.	1
2 Timothy	3	6	For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,	1
2 Timothy	3	7	always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.	1
2 Timothy	3	8	Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.	1
2 Timothy	3	9	But they will proceed no further.  For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.	1
2 Timothy	3	10	But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,	1
2 Timothy	3	11	persecutions, and sufferings:  those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.  I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.	1
2 Timothy	3	12	Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.	1
2 Timothy	3	13	But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.	1
2 Timothy	3	14	But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.	1
2 Timothy	3	15	From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.	1
2 Timothy	3	16	Every writing inspired by God{literally, God-breathed} is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in righteousness,	1
2 Timothy	3	17	that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.	1
2 Timothy	4	1	I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:	1
2 Timothy	4	2	preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.	1
2 Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;	1
2 Timothy	4	4	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.	1
2 Timothy	4	5	But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.	1
2 Timothy	4	6	For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.	1
2 Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight.  I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.	1
2 Timothy	4	8	From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.	1
2 Timothy	4	9	Be diligent to come to me soon,	1
2 Timothy	4	10	for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.	1
2 Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.	1
2 Timothy	4	12	But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.	1
2 Timothy	4	13	Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.	1
2 Timothy	4	14	Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,	1
2 Timothy	4	15	of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.	1
2 Timothy	4	16	At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.	1
2 Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.	1
2 Timothy	4	18	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	1
2 Timothy	4	19	Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.	1
2 Timothy	4	20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.	1
2 Timothy	4	21	Be diligent to come before winter.  Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.	1
Philippians	6	24	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.  Amen.	2
Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ; To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers{or, superintendents, or bishops} and servants{Or, deacons}:	2
Philippians	1	2	Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2
Philippians	1	3	I thank my God whenever I remember you,	2
Philippians	1	4	always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,	2
Philippians	1	5	for your partnership{The word translated partnership (koinonia) also means fellowship and sharing.} in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;	2
Philippians	1	6	being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.	2
Philippians	1	7	It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.	2
Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.	2
Philippians	1	9	This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;	2
Philippians	1	10	so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;	2
Philippians	1	11	being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.	2
Philippians	1	12	Now I desire to have you know, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;	2
Philippians	1	13	so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;	2
Philippians	1	14	and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.	2
Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.	2
Philippians	1	16	The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;	2
Philippians	1	17	but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.	2
Philippians	1	18	What does it matter?  Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.	2
Philippians	1	19	For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	2
Philippians	1	20	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.	2
Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.	2
Philippians	1	22	But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don't make known what I will choose.	2
Philippians	1	23	But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.	2
Philippians	1	24	Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.	2
Philippians	1	25	Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,	2
Philippians	1	26	that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.	2
Philippians	1	27	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;	2
Philippians	1	28	and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.	2
Philippians	1	29	Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,	2
Philippians	1	30	having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.	2
Philippians	2	1	If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,	2
Philippians	2	2	make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;	2
Philippians	2	3	doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;	2
Philippians	2	4	each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.	2
Philippians	2	5	Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,	2
Philippians	2	6	who, existing in the form of God, didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,	2
Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.	2
Philippians	2	8	And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.	2
Philippians	2	9	Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;	2
Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,	2
Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	2
Philippians	2	12	So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.	2
Philippians	2	13	For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.	2
Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputes,	2
Philippians	2	15	that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,	2
Philippians	2	16	holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn't run in vain nor labor in vain.	2
Philippians	2	17	Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.	2
Philippians	2	18	In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.	2
Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.	2
Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.	2
Philippians	2	21	For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.	2
Philippians	2	22	But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.	2
Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.	2
Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.	2
Philippians	2	25	But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;	2
Philippians	2	26	since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.	2
Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.	2
Philippians	2	28	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	2
Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,	2
Philippians	2	30	because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.	2
Philippians	3	1	Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.	2
Philippians	3	2	Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.	2
Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;	2
Philippians	3	4	though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:	2
Philippians	3	5	circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;	2
Philippians	3	6	concerning zeal, persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.	2
Philippians	3	7	However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.	2
Philippians	3	8	Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ	2
Philippians	3	9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;	2
Philippians	3	10	that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;	2
Philippians	3	11	if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.	2
Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.	2
Philippians	3	13	Brothers, I don't regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do.  Forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,	2
Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	2
Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.	2
Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless, to the extent that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.  Let us be of the same mind.	2
Philippians	3	17	Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.	2
Philippians	3	18	For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,	2
Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.	2
Philippians	3	20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;	2
Philippians	3	21	who will change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.	2
Philippians	4	1	Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.	2
Philippians	4	2	I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.	2
Philippians	4	3	Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.	2
Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always!  Again I will say, Rejoice!	2
Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness be known to all men.  The Lord is at hand.	2
Philippians	4	6	In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.	2
Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.	2
Philippians	4	8	Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.	2
Philippians	4	9	The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.	2
Philippians	4	10	But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.	2
Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.	2
Philippians	4	12	I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.	2
Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.	2
Philippians	4	14	However you did well that you shared in my affliction.	2
Philippians	4	15	You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.	2
Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.	2
Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.	2
Philippians	4	18	But I have all things, and abound.  I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.	2
Philippians	4	19	My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.	2
Philippians	4	20	Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever!  Amen.	2
Philippians	4	21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.  The brothers who are with me greet you.	2
Philippians	4	22	All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.	2
Philemon	3	15	All who are with me greet you.  Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.  Amen.	3
Philemon	1	1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,	3
Philemon	1	2	to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:	3
Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	3
Philemon	1	4	I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,	3
Philemon	1	5	hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;	3
Philemon	1	6	that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.	3
Philemon	1	7	For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.	3
Philemon	1	8	Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,	3
Philemon	1	9	yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	3
Philemon	1	10	I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,{Onesimus means useful.}	3
Philemon	1	11	who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.	3
Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back.  Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,	3
Philemon	1	13	whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.	3
Philemon	1	14	But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.	3
Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,	3
Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.	3
Philemon	1	17	If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.	3
Philemon	1	18	But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.	3
Philemon	1	19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand:  I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).	3
Philemon	1	20	Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.	3
Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.	3
Philemon	1	22	Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.	3
Philemon	1	23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,	3
Philemon	1	24	as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.	3
Acts	21	25	There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.	4
Acts	1	1	The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,	4
Acts	1	2	until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.	4
Acts	1	3	To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.	4
Acts	1	4	Being assembled together with them, he charged them, Don't depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me.	4
Acts	1	5	For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.	4
Acts	1	6	Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?	4
Acts	1	7	He said to them, It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority.	4
Acts	1	8	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth.	4
Acts	1	9	When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.	4
Acts	1	10	While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,	4
Acts	1	11	who also said, You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky?  This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky.	4
Acts	1	12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.	4
Acts	1	13	When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.	4
Acts	1	14	All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.	4
Acts	1	15	In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,	4
Acts	1	16	Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.	4
Acts	1	17	For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.	4
Acts	1	18	Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.	4
Acts	1	19	It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'	4
Acts	1	20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his habitation be made desolate.  Let no one dwell therein;'{Psalm 69:25} and, 'Let another take his office.'{Psalm 109:8}	4
Acts	1	21	Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,	4
Acts	1	22	beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection.	4
Acts	1	23	They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.	4
Acts	1	24	They prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen	4
Acts	1	25	to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.	4
Acts	1	26	They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.	4
Acts	2	1	Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.	4
Acts	2	2	Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.	4
Acts	2	3	Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.	4
Acts	2	4	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.	4
Acts	2	5	Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky.	4
Acts	2	6	When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.	4
Acts	2	7	They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?	4
Acts	2	8	How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?	4
Acts	2	9	Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,	4
Acts	2	10	Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,	4
Acts	2	11	Cretans and Arabians:  we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!	4
Acts	2	12	They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What does this mean?	4
Acts	2	13	Others, mocking, said, They are filled with new wine.	4
Acts	2	14	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.	4
Acts	2	15	For these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day{about 9:00 AM}.	4
Acts	2	16	But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:	4
Acts	2	17	'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.  Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.  Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams.	4
Acts	2	18	Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.	4
Acts	2	19	I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.	4
Acts	2	20	The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.	4
Acts	2	21	It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.'{Joel 2:28-32}	4
Acts	2	22	Men of Israel, hear these words!  Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,	4
Acts	2	23	him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;	4
Acts	2	24	whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.	4
Acts	2	25	For David says concerning him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.	4
Acts	2	26	Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;	4
Acts	2	27	because you will not leave my soul in Hades{or, Hell}, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.	4
Acts	2	28	You made known to me the ways of life.  You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'{Psalm 16:8-11}	4
Acts	2	29	Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.	4
Acts	2	30	Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,	4
Acts	2	31	he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul left in Hades{or, Hell}, nor did his flesh see decay.	4
Acts	2	32	This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.	4
Acts	2	33	Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.	4
Acts	2	34	For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right hand,	4
Acts	2	35	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'{Psalm 110:1}	4
Acts	2	36	Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.	4
Acts	2	37	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?	4
Acts	2	38	Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	2	39	For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.	4
Acts	2	40	With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation!	4
Acts	2	41	Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.	4
Acts	2	42	They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.	4
Acts	2	43	Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.	4
Acts	2	44	All who believed were together, and had all things in common.	4
Acts	2	45	They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.	4
Acts	2	46	Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,	4
Acts	2	47	praising God, and having favor with all the people.  The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.	4
Acts	3	1	Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour{3:00 PM}.	4
Acts	3	2	A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.	4
Acts	3	3	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.	4
Acts	3	4	Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, Look at us.	4
Acts	3	5	He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.	4
Acts	3	6	But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you.  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!	4
Acts	3	7	He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.	4
Acts	3	8	Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk.  He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.	4
Acts	3	9	All the people saw him walking and praising God.	4
Acts	3	10	They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.	4
Acts	3	11	As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.	4
Acts	3	12	When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man?  Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?	4
Acts	3	13	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.	4
Acts	3	14	But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,	4
Acts	3	15	and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.	4
Acts	3	16	By faith in his name has his name made this man strong, whom you see and know.  Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.	4
Acts	3	17	Now, brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.	4
Acts	3	18	But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.	4
Acts	3	19	Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,	4
Acts	3	20	and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,	4
Acts	3	21	whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.	4
Acts	3	22	For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.	4
Acts	3	23	It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'{Deuteronomy 18:15,18-19}	4
Acts	3	24	Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.	4
Acts	3	25	You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'{Genesis 22:18; 26:4}	4
Acts	3	26	God, having raised up his servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness.	4
Acts	4	1	As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,	4
Acts	4	2	being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.	4
Acts	4	3	They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.	4
Acts	4	4	But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.	4
Acts	4	5	It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.	4
Acts	4	6	Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.	4
Acts	4	7	When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?	4
Acts	4	8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,	4
Acts	4	9	if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,	4
Acts	4	10	be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.	4
Acts	4	11	He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'{Psalm 118:22}	4
Acts	4	12	There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!	4
Acts	4	13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.	4
Acts	4	14	Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.	4
Acts	4	15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,	4
Acts	4	16	saying, What shall we do to these men?  Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.	4
Acts	4	17	But so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name.	4
Acts	4	18	They called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.	4
Acts	4	19	But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,	4
Acts	4	20	for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard.	4
Acts	4	21	When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.	4
Acts	4	22	For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.	4
Acts	4	23	Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.	4
Acts	4	24	When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;	4
Acts	4	25	who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?	4
Acts	4	26	The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Lord, and against his Christ{Christ (Greek) and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean Anointed One.}.'{Psalm 2:1-2}	4
Acts	4	27	For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together	4
Acts	4	28	to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.	4
Acts	4	29	Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,	4
Acts	4	30	while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus.	4
Acts	4	31	When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together.  They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.	4
Acts	4	32	The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.	4
Acts	4	33	With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.  Great grace was on them all.	4
Acts	4	34	For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,	4
Acts	4	35	and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.	4
Acts	4	36	Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,	4
Acts	4	37	having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.	4
Acts	5	1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,	4
Acts	5	2	and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.	4
Acts	5	3	But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?	4
Acts	5	4	While you kept it, didn't it remain your own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to men, but to God.	4
Acts	5	5	Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.	4
Acts	5	6	The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.	4
Acts	5	7	About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.	4
Acts	5	8	Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much. She said, Yes, for so much.	4
Acts	5	9	But Peter asked her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?  Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.	4
Acts	5	10	She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.	4
Acts	5	11	Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.	4
Acts	5	12	By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people.  They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.	4
Acts	5	13	None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.	4
Acts	5	14	More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.	4
Acts	5	15	They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them.	4
Acts	5	16	Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits:  and they were all healed.	4
Acts	5	17	But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,	4
Acts	5	18	and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.	4
Acts	5	19	But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,	4
Acts	5	20	Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.	4
Acts	5	21	When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught.  But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.	4
Acts	5	22	But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and reported,	4
Acts	5	23	We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!	4
Acts	5	24	Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.	4
Acts	5	25	One came and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.	4
Acts	5	26	Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.	4
Acts	5	27	When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,	4
Acts	5	28	saying, Didn't we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us.	4
Acts	5	29	But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men.	4
Acts	5	30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree.	4
Acts	5	31	God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.	4
Acts	5	32	We are His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.	4
Acts	5	33	But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.	4
Acts	5	34	But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.	4
Acts	5	35	He said to them, You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.	4
Acts	5	36	For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves:  who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.	4
Acts	5	37	After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.	4
Acts	5	38	Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.	4
Acts	5	39	But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!	4
Acts	5	40	They agreed with him.  Summoning the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.	4
Acts	5	41	They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus' name.	4
Acts	5	42	Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.	4
Acts	6	1	Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists{The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.} against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.	4
Acts	6	2	The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.	4
Acts	6	3	Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.	4
Acts	6	4	But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.	4
Acts	6	5	These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;	4
Acts	6	6	whom they set before the apostles.  When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.	4
Acts	6	7	The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly.  A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.	4
Acts	6	8	Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.	4
Acts	6	9	But some of those who were of the synagogue called The Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.	4
Acts	6	10	They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.	4
Acts	6	11	Then they secretly induced men to say, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.	4
Acts	6	12	They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,	4
Acts	6	13	and set up false witnesses who said, This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.	4
Acts	6	14	For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.	4
Acts	6	15	All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.	4
Acts	7	1	The high priest said, Are these things so?	4
Acts	7	2	He said, Brothers and fathers, listen.  The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,	4
Acts	7	3	and said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'{Genesis 12:1}	4
Acts	7	4	Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living.	4
Acts	7	5	He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on.  He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child.	4
Acts	7	6	God spoke in this way:  that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.	4
Acts	7	7	'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'{Genesis 15:13-14}	4
Acts	7	8	He gave him the covenant of circumcision.  So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.	4
Acts	7	9	The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt.  God was with him,	4
Acts	7	10	and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house.	4
Acts	7	11	Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction.  Our fathers found no food.	4
Acts	7	12	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.	4
Acts	7	13	On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh.	4
Acts	7	14	Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.	4
Acts	7	15	Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,	4
Acts	7	16	and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.	4
Acts	7	17	But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,	4
Acts	7	18	until there arose a different king, who didn't know Joseph.	4
Acts	7	19	The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn't stay alive.	4
Acts	7	20	At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's house.	4

Acts	8	9	But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,	4
Acts	8	10	to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God.	4
Acts	8	11	They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.	4
Acts	8	12	But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.	4
Acts	8	13	Simon himself also believed.  Being baptized, he continued with Philip.  Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.	4
Acts	8	14	Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,	4
Acts	8	15	who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;	4
Acts	8	16	for as yet he had fallen on none of them.  They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.	4
Acts	8	17	Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	8	18	Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,	4
Acts	8	19	saying, Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	8	20	But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!	4
Acts	8	21	You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right before God.	4
Acts	8	22	Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.	4
Acts	8	23	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.	4
Acts	8	24	Simon answered, Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.	4
Acts	8	25	They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.	4
Acts	8	26	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.	4
Acts	8	27	He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.	4
Acts	8	28	He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.	4
Acts	8	29	The Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.	4
Acts	8	30	Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?	4
Acts	8	31	He said, How can I, unless someone explains it to me? He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.	4
Acts	8	32	Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.  As a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he doesn't open his mouth.	4
Acts	8	33	In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. Who will declare His generation?  For his life is taken from the earth.{Isaiah 53:7,8}	4
Acts	8	34	The eunuch answered Philip, Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?	4
Acts	8	35	Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.	4
Acts	8	36	As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, Behold, here is water.  What is keeping me from being baptized?	4
Acts	8	37	{TR adds Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may.' He answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'}	4
Acts	8	38	He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.	4
Acts	8	39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.	4
Acts	8	40	But Philip was found at Azotus.  Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.	4
Acts	9	1	But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,	4
Acts	9	2	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.	4
Acts	9	3	As he traveled, it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him.	4
Acts	9	4	He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?	4
Acts	9	5	He said, Who are you, Lord?  The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.{TR adds It's hard for you to kick against the goads.}	4
Acts	9	6	But{TR omits But } rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do.	4
Acts	9	7	The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.	4
Acts	9	8	Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one.  They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.	4
Acts	9	9	He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.	4
Acts	9	10	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias!  He said, Behold, it's me, Lord.	4
Acts	9	11	The Lord said to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah{or, Judas} for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,	4
Acts	9	12	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.	4
Acts	9	13	But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem.	4
Acts	9	14	Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.	4
Acts	9	15	But the Lord said to him, Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel.	4
Acts	9	16	For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake.	4
Acts	9	17	Ananias departed, and entered into the house.  Laying his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	9	18	Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight.  He arose and was baptized.	4
Acts	9	19	He took food and was strengthened.  Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.	4
Acts	9	20	Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God.	4
Acts	9	21	All who heard him were amazed, and said, Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!	4
Acts	9	22	But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.	4
Acts	9	23	When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,	4
Acts	9	24	but their plot became known to Saul.  They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,	4
Acts	9	25	but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.	4
Acts	9	26	When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.	4
Acts	9	27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.	4
Acts	9	28	He was with them entering into{TR and NU add and going out} Jerusalem,	4
Acts	9	29	preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.  He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists,{The Hellenists were Hebrews who used Greek language and culture.} but they were seeking to kill him.	4
Acts	9	30	When the brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.	4
Acts	9	31	So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up.  They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	9	32	It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.	4
Acts	9	33	There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed.	4
Acts	9	34	Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!  Immediately he arose.	4
Acts	9	35	All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.	4
Acts	9	36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas.{Dorcas is Greek for Gazelle.} This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did.	4
Acts	9	37	It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.	4
Acts	9	38	As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men{Reading from NU, TR; MT omits two men} to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them.	4
Acts	9	39	Peter got up and went with them.  When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber.  All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.	4
Acts	9	40	Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up! She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.	4
Acts	9	41	He gave her his hand, and raised her up.  Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.	4
Acts	9	42	And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.	4
Acts	9	43	It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.	4
Acts	10	1	Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,	4
Acts	10	2	a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.	4
Acts	10	3	At about the ninth hour of the day{3:00 PM}, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!	4
Acts	10	4	He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, What is it, Lord?  He said to him, Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.	4
Acts	10	5	Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter.	4
Acts	10	6	He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.{TR adds This one will tell you what it is necessary for you to do.}	4
Acts	10	7	When the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.	4
Acts	10	8	Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.	4
Acts	10	9	Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.	4
Acts	10	10	He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.	4
Acts	10	11	He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,	4
Acts	10	12	in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.	4
Acts	10	13	A voice came to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat!	4
Acts	10	14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.	4
Acts	10	15	A voice came to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean.	4
Acts	10	16	This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.	4
Acts	10	17	Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,	4
Acts	10	18	and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.	4
Acts	10	19	While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three{Reading from TR and NU. MT omits three} men seek you.	4
Acts	10	20	But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.	4
Acts	10	21	Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?	4
Acts	10	22	They said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.	4
Acts	10	23	So he called them in and lodged them.  On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.	4
Acts	10	24	On the next day they entered into Caesarea.  Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.	4
Acts	10	25	When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.	4
Acts	10	26	But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up!  I myself am also a man.	4
Acts	10	27	As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.	4
Acts	10	28	He said to them, You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any man unholy or unclean.	4
Acts	10	29	Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?	4
Acts	10	30	Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour,{3:00 P. M.} I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,	4
Acts	10	31	and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.	4
Acts	10	32	Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.'	4
Acts	10	33	Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.	4
Acts	10	34	Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;	4
Acts	10	35	but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.	4
Acts	10	36	The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--he is Lord of all--	4
Acts	10	37	that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;	4
Acts	10	38	even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.	4
Acts	10	39	We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also{TR omits also} killed, hanging him on a tree.	4
Acts	10	40	God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,	4
Acts	10	41	not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.	4
Acts	10	42	He charged us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.	4
Acts	10	43	All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.	4
Acts	10	44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.	4
Acts	10	45	They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the nations.	4
Acts	10	46	For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,	4
Acts	10	47	Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?	4
Acts	10	48	He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.	4
Acts	11	1	Now the apostles and the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.	4
Acts	11	2	When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,	4
Acts	11	3	saying, You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!	4
Acts	11	4	But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,	4
Acts	11	5	I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision:  a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.	4
Acts	11	6	When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.	4
Acts	11	7	I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'	4
Acts	11	8	But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'	4
Acts	11	9	But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, don't you call unclean.'	4
Acts	11	10	This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.	4
Acts	11	11	Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.	4
Acts	11	12	The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house.	4
Acts	11	13	He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,	4
Acts	11	14	who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'	4
Acts	11	15	As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.	4
Acts	11	16	I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'	4
Acts	11	17	If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?	4
Acts	11	18	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!	4
Acts	11	19	They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.	4
Acts	11	20	But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists,{A Hellenist is someone who keeps Greek customs and culture.} preaching the Lord Jesus.	4
Acts	11	21	The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.	4
Acts	11	22	The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem.  They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,	4
Acts	11	23	who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord.	4
Acts	11	24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.	4
Acts	11	25	Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.	4
Acts	11	26	When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.	4
Acts	11	27	Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.	4
Acts	11	28	One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.	4
Acts	11	29	As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;	4
Acts	11	30	which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.	4
Acts	12	1	Now about that time, Herod the king stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.	4
Acts	12	2	He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.	4
Acts	12	3	When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also.  This was during the days of unleavened bread.	4
Acts	12	4	When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.	4
Acts	12	5	Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.	4
Acts	12	6	The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.	4
Acts	12	7	And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell.  He struck Peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, Stand up quickly!  His chains fell off from his hands.	4
Acts	12	8	The angel said to him, Get dressed and put on your sandals. He did so.  He said to him, Put on your cloak, and follow me.	4
Acts	12	9	And he went out and followed him.  He didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.	4
Acts	12	10	When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself.  They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.	4
Acts	12	11	When Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting.	4
Acts	12	12	Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.	4
Acts	12	13	When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.	4
Acts	12	14	When she recognized Peter's voice, she didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate.	4
Acts	12	15	They said to her, You are crazy!  But she insisted that it was so. They said, It is his angel.	4
Acts	12	16	But Peter continued knocking.  When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.	4
Acts	12	17	But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, Tell these things to James, and to the brothers. Then he departed, and went to another place.	4
Acts	12	18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.	4
Acts	12	19	When Herod had sought for him, and didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.	4
Acts	12	20	Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.	4
Acts	12	21	On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.	4
Acts	12	22	The people shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man!	4
Acts	12	23	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he didn't give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.	4
Acts	12	24	But the word of God grew and multiplied.	4
Acts	12	25	Barnabas and Saul returned to{TR reads from instead of to} Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark.	4
Acts	13	1	Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers:  Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.	4
Acts	13	2	As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them.	4
Acts	13	3	Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.	4
Acts	13	4	So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.	4
Acts	13	5	When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues.  They had also John as their attendant.	4
Acts	13	6	When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus,	4
Acts	13	7	who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.	4
Acts	13	8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.	4
Acts	13	9	But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,	4
Acts	13	10	and said, Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?	4
Acts	13	11	Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season! Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him.  He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.	4
Acts	13	12	Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.	4
Acts	13	13	Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia.  John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.	4
Acts	13	14	But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.	4
Acts	13	15	After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.	4
Acts	13	16	Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.	4
Acts	13	17	The God of this people{TR, NU add Israel} chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.	4
Acts	13	18	For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.	4
Acts	13	19	When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years.	4
Acts	13	20	After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.	4
Acts	13	21	Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.	4
Acts	13	22	When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'	4
Acts	13	23	From this man's seed, God has brought salvation{TR, NU read a Savior, Jesus instead of salvation} to Israel according to his promise,	4
Acts	13	24	before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.{TR, NU read to all the people of Israel instead of to Israel}	4
Acts	13	25	As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am?  I am not he.  But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'	4
Acts	13	26	Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.	4
Acts	13	27	For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.	4
Acts	13	28	Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed.	4
Acts	13	29	When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.	4
Acts	13	30	But God raised him from the dead,	4
Acts	13	31	and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.	4
Acts	13	32	We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,	4
Acts	13	33	that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus.  As it is also written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son.  Today I have become your father.'{Psalm 2:7}	4
Acts	13	34	Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus:  'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'{Isaiah 55:3}	4
Acts	13	35	Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'{Psalm 16:10}	4
Acts	13	36	For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.	4
Acts	13	37	But he whom God raised up saw no decay.	4
Acts	13	38	Be it known to you therefore, brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,	4
Acts	13	39	and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.	4
Acts	13	40	Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:	4
Acts	13	41	'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'{Habakkuk 1:5}	4
Acts	13	42	So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.	4
Acts	13	43	Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.	4
Acts	13	44	The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.	4
Acts	13	45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.	4
Acts	13	46	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.	4
Acts	13	47	For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'{Isaiah 49:6}	4
Acts	13	48	As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God.  As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.	4
Acts	13	49	The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.	4
Acts	13	50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.	4
Acts	13	51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.	4
Acts	13	52	The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	14	1	It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.	4
Acts	14	2	But the disbelieving{or, disobedient} Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.	4
Acts	14	3	Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.	4
Acts	14	4	But the multitude of the city was divided.  Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.	4
Acts	14	5	When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,	4
Acts	14	6	they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.	4
Acts	14	7	There they preached the Good News.	4
Acts	14	8	At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.	4
Acts	14	9	He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,	4
Acts	14	10	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet! He leaped up and walked.	4
Acts	14	11	When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!	4
Acts	14	12	They called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.	4
Acts	14	13	The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.	4
Acts	14	14	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,	4
Acts	14	15	Men, why are you doing these things?  We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;	4
Acts	14	16	who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.	4
Acts	14	17	Yet he didn't leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you{TR reads us instead of you} rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.	4
Acts	14	18	Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.	4
Acts	14	19	But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.	4
Acts	14	20	But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city.  On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.	4
Acts	14	21	When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,	4
Acts	14	22	confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.	4
Acts	14	23	When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.	4
Acts	14	24	They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.	4
Acts	14	25	When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.	4
Acts	14	26	From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.	4
Acts	14	27	When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.	4
Acts	14	28	They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.	4
Acts	15	1	Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can't be saved.	4
Acts	15	2	Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.	4
Acts	15	3	They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}	4
Acts	15	4	When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.	4
Acts	15	5	But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.	4
Acts	15	6	The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.	4
Acts	15	7	When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.	4
Acts	15	8	God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.	4
Acts	15	9	He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.	4
Acts	15	10	Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?	4
Acts	15	11	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus,{TR adds Christ} just as they are.	4
Acts	15	12	All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them.	4
Acts	15	13	After they were silent, James answered, Brothers, listen to me.	4
Acts	15	14	Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.	4
Acts	15	15	This agrees with the words of the prophets.  As it is written,	4
Acts	15	16	'After these things I will return.  I will again build the tent of David, which has fallen.  I will again build its ruins. I will set it up,	4
Acts	15	17	That the rest of men may seek after the Lord; All the Gentiles who are called by my name, Says the Lord, who does all these things.{Amos 9:11-12}	4
Acts	15	18	All his works are known to God from eternity.'	4
Acts	15	19	Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,	4
Acts	15	20	but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.	4
Acts	15	21	For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.	4
Acts	15	22	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas:  Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers.{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}	4
Acts	15	23	They wrote these things by their hand:  The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:  greetings.	4
Acts	15	24	Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no commandment;	4
Acts	15	25	it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,	4
Acts	15	26	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.	4
Acts	15	27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.	4
Acts	15	28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:	4
Acts	15	29	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you.  Farewell.	4
Acts	15	30	So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.	4
Acts	15	31	When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.	4
Acts	15	32	Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them.	4
Acts	15	33	After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles.	4
Acts	15	34	{Some manuscripts add:  But it seemed good to Silas to stay there.}	4
Acts	15	35	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.	4
Acts	15	36	After some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.	4
Acts	15	37	Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also.	4
Acts	15	38	But Paul didn't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work.	4
Acts	15	39	Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other.  Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,	4
Acts	15	40	but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God.	4
Acts	15	41	He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.	4
Acts	16	1	He came to Derbe and Lystra:  and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek.	4
Acts	16	2	The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him.	4
Acts	16	3	Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.	4
Acts	16	4	As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.	4
Acts	16	5	So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.	4
Acts	16	6	When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.	4
Acts	16	7	When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them.	4
Acts	16	8	Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.	4
Acts	16	9	A vision appeared to Paul in the night.  There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.	4
Acts	16	10	When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them.	4
Acts	16	11	Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;	4
Acts	16	12	and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony.  We were staying some days in this city.	4
Acts	16	13	On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together.	4
Acts	16	14	A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul.	4
Acts	16	15	When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay.  So she persuaded us.	4
Acts	16	16	It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.	4
Acts	16	17	Following Paul and us, she cried out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation!	4
Acts	16	18	She was doing this for many days.  But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! It came out that very hour.	4
Acts	16	19	But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.	4
Acts	16	20	When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,	4
Acts	16	21	and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.	4
Acts	16	22	The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.	4
Acts	16	23	When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,	4
Acts	16	24	who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.	4
Acts	16	25	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.	4
Acts	16	26	Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.	4
Acts	16	27	The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.	4
Acts	16	28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!	4
Acts	16	29	He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,	4
Acts	16	30	and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?	4
Acts	16	31	They said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.	4
Acts	16	32	They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.	4
Acts	16	33	He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.	4
Acts	16	34	He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God.	4
Acts	16	35	But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.	4
Acts	16	36	The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace.	4
Acts	16	37	But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly?  No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!	4
Acts	16	38	The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,	4
Acts	16	39	and they came and begged them.  When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.	4
Acts	16	40	They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.	4
Acts	17	1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.	4
Acts	17	2	Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,	4
Acts	17	3	explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.	4
Acts	17	4	Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.	4
Acts	17	5	But the unpersuaded Jews took along{TR reads And the Jews who were unpersuaded, becoming envious and taking along instead of But the unpersuaded Jews took along} some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar.  Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.	4
Acts	17	6	When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} before the rulers of the city, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,	4
Acts	17	7	whom Jason has received.  These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!	4
Acts	17	8	The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.	4
Acts	17	9	When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.	4
Acts	17	10	The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.	4
Acts	17	11	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.	4
Acts	17	12	Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.	4
Acts	17	13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.	4
Acts	17	14	Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.	4
Acts	17	15	But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.	4
Acts	17	16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.	4
Acts	17	17	So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.	4
Acts	17	18	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also{TR omits also} were conversing with him.  Some said, What does this babbler want to say?  Others said, He seems to be advocating foreign deities, because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.	4
Acts	17	19	They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?	4
Acts	17	20	For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean.	4
Acts	17	21	Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.	4
Acts	17	22	Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.	4
Acts	17	23	For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription:  'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.	4
Acts	17	24	The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,	4
Acts	17	25	neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.	4
Acts	17	26	He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,	4
Acts	17	27	that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.	4
Acts	17	28	'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.'  As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'	4
Acts	17	29	Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.	4
Acts	17	30	The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,	4
Acts	17	31	because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.	4
Acts	17	32	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We want to hear you again concerning this.	4
Acts	17	33	Thus Paul went out from among them.	4
Acts	17	34	But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.	4
Acts	18	1	After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.	4
Acts	18	2	He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,	4
Acts	18	3	and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.	4
Acts	18	4	He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.	4
Acts	18	5	But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.	4
Acts	18	6	When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads!  I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!	4
Acts	18	7	He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.	4
Acts	18	8	Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house.  Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.	4
Acts	18	9	The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent;	4
Acts	18	10	for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.	4
Acts	18	11	He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.	4
Acts	18	12	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,	4
Acts	18	13	saying, This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.	4
Acts	18	14	But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;	4
Acts	18	15	but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves.  For I don't want to be a judge of these matters.	4
Acts	18	16	He drove them from the judgment seat.	4
Acts	18	17	Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.	4
Acts	18	18	Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers,{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.	4
Acts	18	19	He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.	4
Acts	18	20	When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;	4
Acts	18	21	but taking his leave of them, and saying, I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus.	4
Acts	18	22	When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.	4
Acts	18	23	Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.	4
Acts	18	24	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus.  He was mighty in the Scriptures.	4
Acts	18	25	This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.	4
Acts	18	26	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.  But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.	4
Acts	18	27	When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;	4
Acts	18	28	for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.	4
Acts	19	1	It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.	4
Acts	19	2	He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said to him, No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.	4
Acts	19	3	He said, Into what then were you baptized?  They said, Into John's baptism.	4
Acts	19	4	Paul said, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.	4
Acts	19	5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	4
Acts	19	6	When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.	4
Acts	19	7	They were about twelve men in all.	4
Acts	19	8	He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.	4
Acts	19	9	But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.	4
Acts	19	10	This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.	4
Acts	19	11	God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,	4
Acts	19	12	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.	4
Acts	19	13	But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.	4
Acts	19	14	There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.	4
Acts	19	15	The evil spirit answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?	4
Acts	19	16	The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.	4
Acts	19	17	This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.	4
Acts	19	18	Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.	4
Acts	19	19	Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.{The 50,000 pieces of silver here probably referred to 50,000 drachmas.  If so, the value of the burned books was equivalent to about 160 man-years of wages for agricultural laborers}	4
Acts	19	20	So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.	4
Acts	19	21	Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.	4
Acts	19	22	Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.	4
Acts	19	23	About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.	4
Acts	19	24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,	4
Acts	19	25	whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.	4
Acts	19	26	You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.	4
Acts	19	27	Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.	4
Acts	19	28	When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!	4
Acts	19	29	The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.	4
Acts	19	30	When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow him.	4
Acts	19	31	Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.	4
Acts	19	32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion.  Most of them didn't know why they had come together.	4
Acts	19	33	They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.  Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.	4
Acts	19	34	But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!	4
Acts	19	35	When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?	4
Acts	19	36	Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.	4
Acts	19	37	For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.	4
Acts	19	38	If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls.  Let them press charges against one another.	4
Acts	19	39	But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.	4
Acts	19	40	For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause.  Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion.	4
Acts	19	41	When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.	4
Acts	20	1	After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.	4
Acts	20	2	When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.	4
Acts	20	3	When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.	4
Acts	20	4	These accompanied him as far as Asia:  Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.	4
Acts	20	5	But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.	4
Acts	20	6	We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.	4
Acts	20	7	On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight.	4
Acts	20	8	There were many lights in the upper chamber where we{TR reads they instead of we} were gathered together.	4
Acts	20	9	A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep.  As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.	4
Acts	20	10	Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, Don't be troubled, for his life is in him.	4
Acts	20	11	When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.	4
Acts	20	12	They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.	4
Acts	20	13	But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.	4
Acts	20	14	When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene.	4
Acts	20	15	Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.	4
Acts	20	16	For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.	4
Acts	20	17	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.	4
Acts	20	18	When they had come to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,	4
Acts	20	19	serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;	4
Acts	20	20	how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,	4
Acts	20	21	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.{TR adds Christ}	4
Acts	20	22	Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;	4
Acts	20	23	except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.	4
Acts	20	24	But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.	4
Acts	20	25	Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.	4
Acts	20	26	Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,	4
Acts	20	27	for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.	4
Acts	20	28	Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and{TR, NU omit the Lord and} God which he purchased with his own blood.	4
Acts	20	29	For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.	4
Acts	20	30	Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.	4
Acts	20	31	Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.	4
Acts	20	32	Now, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.	4
Acts	20	33	I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.	4
Acts	20	34	You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.	4
Acts	20	35	In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'	4
Acts	20	36	When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.	4
Acts	20	37	They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,	4
Acts	20	38	sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more.  And they accompanied him to the ship.	4
Acts	21	1	When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.	4
Acts	21	2	Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.	4
Acts	21	3	When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.	4
Acts	21	4	Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.	4
Acts	21	5	When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey.  They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.	4
Acts	21	6	After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.	4
Acts	21	7	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.	4
Acts	21	8	On the next day, we, who were Paul's companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.  We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.	4
Acts	21	9	Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.	4
Acts	21	10	As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.	4
Acts	21	11	Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit:  'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'	4
Acts	21	12	When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.	4
Acts	21	13	Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart?  For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.	4
Acts	21	14	When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The Lord's will be done.	4
Acts	21	15	After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.	4
Acts	21	16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.	4
Acts	21	17	When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.	4
Acts	21	18	The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.	4
Acts	21	19	When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.	4
Acts	21	20	They, when they heard it, glorified God.  They said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.	4
Acts	21	21	They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.	4
Acts	21	22	What then?  The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.	4
Acts	21	23	Therefore do what we tell you.  We have four men who have taken a vow.	4
Acts	21	24	Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.	4
Acts	21	25	But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.	4
Acts	21	26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.	4
Acts	21	27	When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,	4
Acts	21	28	crying out, Men of Israel, help!  This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!	4
Acts	21	29	For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.	4
Acts	21	30	All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.	4
Acts	21	31	As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.	4
Acts	21	32	Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.	4
Acts	21	33	Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.	4
Acts	21	34	Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.	4
Acts	21	35	When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;	4
Acts	21	36	for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him!	4
Acts	21	37	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, May I speak to you? He said, Do you know Greek?	4
Acts	21	38	Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?	4
Acts	21	39	But Paul said, I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city.  I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.	4
Acts	21	40	When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people.  When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,	4
Acts	22	1	Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you.	4
Acts	22	2	When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet.  He said,	4
Acts	22	3	I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.	4
Acts	22	4	I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.	4
Acts	22	5	As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.	4
Acts	22	6	It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.	4
Acts	22	7	I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'	4
Acts	22	8	I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?'  He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'	4
Acts	22	9	Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn't understand the voice of him who spoke to me.	4
Acts	22	10	I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?'  The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus.  There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'	4
Acts	22	11	When I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.	4
Acts	22	12	One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,	4
Acts	22	13	came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!'  In that very hour I looked up at him.	4
Acts	22	14	He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.	4
Acts	22	15	For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.	4
Acts	22	16	Now why do you wait?  Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'	4
Acts	22	17	It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,	4
Acts	22	18	and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'	4
Acts	22	19	I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.	4
Acts	22	20	When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'	4
Acts	22	21	He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'	4
Acts	22	22	They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, Rid the earth of this fellow, for he isn't fit to live!	4
Acts	22	23	As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,	4
Acts	22	24	the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that.	4
Acts	22	25	When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?	4
Acts	22	26	When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!	4
Acts	22	27	The commanding officer came and asked him, Tell me, are you a Roman?  He said, Yes.	4
Acts	22	28	The commanding officer answered, I bought my citizenship for a great price.  Paul said, But I was born a Roman.	4
Acts	22	29	Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.	4
Acts	22	30	But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.	4
Acts	23	1	Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.	4
Acts	23	2	The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.	4
Acts	23	3	Then Paul said to him, God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?	4
Acts	23	4	Those who stood by said, Do you malign God's high priest?	4
Acts	23	5	Paul said, I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'{Exodus 22:28}	4
Acts	23	6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!	4
Acts	23	7	When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.	4
Acts	23	8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.	4
Acts	23	9	A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let's not fight against God!	4
Acts	23	10	When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.	4
Acts	23	11	The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome.	4
Acts	23	12	When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.	4
Acts	23	13	There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.	4
Acts	23	14	They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.	4
Acts	23	15	Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near.	4
Acts	23	16	But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.	4
Acts	23	17	Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him.	4
Acts	23	18	So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you.	4
Acts	23	19	The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me?	4
Acts	23	20	He said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.	4
Acts	23	21	Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.	4
Acts	23	22	So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.	4
Acts	23	23	He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night{about 9:00 PM}.	4
Acts	23	24	He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.	4
Acts	23	25	He wrote a letter like this:	4
Acts	23	26	Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix:  Greetings.	4
Acts	23	27	This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.	4
Acts	23	28	Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.	4
Acts	23	29	I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.	4
Acts	23	30	When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you.  Farewell.	4
Acts	23	31	So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.	4
Acts	23	32	But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks.	4
Acts	23	33	When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.	4
Acts	23	34	When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,	4
Acts	23	35	I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive. He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.	4
Acts	24	1	After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.	4
Acts	24	2	When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,	4
Acts	24	3	we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.	4
Acts	24	4	But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.	4
Acts	24	5	For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.	4
Acts	24	6	He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.{TR adds We wanted to judge him according to our law,}	4
Acts	24	7	{TR adds but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,}	4
Acts	24	8	{TR adds commanding his accusers to come to you.}By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.	4
Acts	24	9	The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.	4
Acts	24	10	When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,	4
Acts	24	11	seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.	4
Acts	24	12	In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.	4
Acts	24	13	Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.	4
Acts	24	14	But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;	4
Acts	24	15	having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.	4
Acts	24	16	Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.	4
Acts	24	17	Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;	4
Acts	24	18	amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.	4
Acts	24	19	They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.	4
Acts	24	20	Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,	4
Acts	24	21	unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'	4
Acts	24	22	But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.	4
Acts	24	23	He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.	4
Acts	24	24	But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.	4
Acts	24	25	As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.	4
Acts	24	26	Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him.  Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.	4
Acts	24	27	But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.	4
Acts	25	1	Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.	4
Acts	25	2	Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and they begged him,	4
Acts	25	3	asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way.	4
Acts	25	4	However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.	4
Acts	25	5	Let them therefore, said he, that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.	4
Acts	25	6	When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.	4
Acts	25	7	When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,	4
Acts	25	8	while he said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.	4
Acts	25	9	But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?	4
Acts	25	10	But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried.  I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.	4
Acts	25	11	For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!	4
Acts	25	12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar.  To Caesar you shall go.	4
Acts	25	13	Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.	4
Acts	25	14	As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;	4
Acts	25	15	about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.	4
Acts	25	16	To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.	4
Acts	25	17	When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought.	4
Acts	25	18	Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;	4
Acts	25	19	but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.	4
Acts	25	20	Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.	4
Acts	25	21	But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar.	4
Acts	25	22	Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.	4
Acts	25	23	So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.	4
Acts	25	24	Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.	4
Acts	25	25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.	4
Acts	25	26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.	4
Acts	25	27	For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him.	4
Acts	26	1	Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.	4
Acts	26	2	I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews,	4
Acts	26	3	especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews.  Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.	4
Acts	26	4	Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;	4
Acts	26	5	having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.	4
Acts	26	6	Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,	4
Acts	26	7	which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain.  Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa!	4
Acts	26	8	Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?	4
Acts	26	9	I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.	4
Acts	26	10	This I also did in Jerusalem.  I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.	4
Acts	26	11	Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme.  Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.	4
Acts	26	12	Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,	4
Acts	26	13	at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.	4
Acts	26	14	When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'	4
Acts	26	15	I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'  He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.	4
Acts	26	16	But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose:  to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;	4
Acts	26	17	delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,	4
Acts	26	18	to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'	4
Acts	26	19	Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,	4
Acts	26	20	but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.	4
Acts	26	21	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.	4
Acts	26	22	Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,	4
Acts	26	23	how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles.	4
Acts	26	24	As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are crazy!  Your great learning is driving you insane!	4
Acts	26	25	But he said, I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.	4
Acts	26	26	For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.	4
Acts	26	27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets?  I know that you believe.	4
Acts	26	28	Agrippa said to Paul, With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?	4
Acts	26	29	Paul said, I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds.	4
Acts	26	30	The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.	4
Acts	26	31	When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.	4
Acts	26	32	Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.	4
Acts	27	1	When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.	4
Acts	27	2	Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.	4
Acts	27	3	The next day, we touched at Sidon.  Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.	4
Acts	27	4	Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.	4
Acts	27	5	When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.	4
Acts	27	6	There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board.	4
Acts	27	7	When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.	4
Acts	27	8	With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.	4
Acts	27	9	When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,	4
Acts	27	10	and said to them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.	4
Acts	27	11	But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.	4
Acts	27	12	Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.	4
Acts	27	13	When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.	4
Acts	27	14	But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.{Or, a northeaster.}	4
Acts	27	15	When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.	4
Acts	27	16	Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.	4
Acts	27	17	After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship.  Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.	4
Acts	27	18	As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.	4
Acts	27	19	On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.	4
Acts	27	20	When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.	4
Acts	27	21	When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.	4
Acts	27	22	Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.	4
Acts	27	23	For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,	4
Acts	27	24	saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul.  You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'	4
Acts	27	25	Therefore, sirs, cheer up!  For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.	4
Acts	27	26	But we must run aground on a certain island.	4
Acts	27	27	But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.	4
Acts	27	28	They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms.{20 fathoms = 120 feet = 36.6 meters} After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.{15 fathoms = 90 feet = 27.4 meters}	4
Acts	27	29	Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.	4
Acts	27	30	As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,	4
Acts	27	31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved.	4
Acts	27	32	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.	4
Acts	27	33	While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.	4
Acts	27	34	Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads.	4
Acts	27	35	When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.	4
Acts	27	36	Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.	4
Acts	27	37	In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.	4
Acts	27	38	When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.	4
Acts	27	39	When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.	4
Acts	27	40	Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes.  Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.	4
Acts	27	41	But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground.  The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.	4
Acts	27	42	The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.	4
Acts	27	43	But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;	4
Acts	27	44	and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship.  So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.	4
Acts	28	1	When we had escaped, then they{NU reads we} learned that the island was called Malta.	4
Acts	28	2	The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.	4
Acts	28	3	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.	4
Acts	28	4	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live.	4
Acts	28	5	However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.	4
Acts	28	6	But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.	4
Acts	28	7	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.	4
Acts	28	8	It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery.  Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.	4
Acts	28	9	Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.	4
Acts	28	10	They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.	4
Acts	28	11	After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.	4
Acts	28	12	Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.	4
Acts	28	13	From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,	4
Acts	28	14	where we found brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} and were entreated to stay with them for seven days.  So we came to Rome.	4
Acts	28	15	From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.	4
Acts	28	16	When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.	4
Acts	28	17	It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews.  When they had come together, he said to them, I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,	4
Acts	28	18	who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.	4
Acts	28	19	But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.	4
Acts	28	20	For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.	4
Acts	28	21	They said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.	4
Acts	28	22	But we desire to hear from you what you think.  For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.	4
Acts	28	23	When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging.  He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.	4
Acts	28	24	Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.	4
Acts	28	25	When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,	4
Acts	28	26	saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand.  In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive.	4
Acts	28	27	For this people's heart has grown callous.  Their ears are dull of hearing.  Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'{Isaiah 6:9-10}	4
Acts	28	28	Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations.  They will also listen.	4
Acts	28	29	When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.	4
Acts	28	30	Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,	4
3 John	1	13	The children of your chosen sister greet you.  Amen.	5
3 John	1	1	The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.	5
3 John	1	2	Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.	5
3 John	1	3	For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth.	5
3 John	1	4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth.	5
3 John	1	5	Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.	5
3 John	1	6	They have testified about your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God,	5
3 John	1	7	because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.	5
3 John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.	5
3 John	1	9	I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn't accept what we say.	5
3 John	1	10	Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly.	5
3 John	1	11	Beloved, don't imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God.  He who does evil hasn't seen God.	5
3 John	1	12	Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.	5
3 John	1	13	I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;	5
1 Peter	5	20	let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.	6
1 Peter	1	1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,	6
1 Peter	1	2	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood:  Grace to you and peace be multiplied.	6
1 Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	6
1 Peter	1	4	to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,	6
1 Peter	1	5	who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.	6
1 Peter	1	6	Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,	6
1 Peter	1	7	that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ--	6
1 Peter	1	8	whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you don't see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--	6
1 Peter	1	9	receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.	6
1 Peter	1	10	Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,	6
1 Peter	1	11	searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.	6
1 Peter	1	12	To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.	6
1 Peter	1	13	Therefore, prepare your minds for action,{literally, gird up the waist of your mind} be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ--	6
1 Peter	1	14	as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,	6
1 Peter	1	15	but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;	6
1 Peter	1	16	because it is written, You shall be holy; for I am holy.{Leviticus 11:44-45}	6
1 Peter	1	17	If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:	6
1 Peter	1	18	knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,	6
1 Peter	1	19	but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;	6
1 Peter	1	20	who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,	6
1 Peter	1	21	who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.	6
1 Peter	1	22	Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:	6
1 Peter	1	23	having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.	6
1 Peter	1	24	For, All flesh is like grass, and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass.  The grass withers, and its flower falls;	6
1 Peter	1	25	but the Lord's word endures forever.{Isaiah 40:6-8} This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.	6
1 Peter	2	1	Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,	6
1 Peter	2	2	as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,	6
1 Peter	2	3	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:	6
1 Peter	2	4	coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.	6
1 Peter	2	5	You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.	6
1 Peter	2	6	Because it is contained in Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}	6
1 Peter	2	7	For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,{Psalm 118:22}	6
1 Peter	2	8	and, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.{Isaiah 8:14} For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.	6
1 Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:	6
1 Peter	2	10	who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	6
1 Peter	2	11	Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	6
1 Peter	2	12	having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.	6
1 Peter	2	13	Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:  whether to the king, as supreme;	6
1 Peter	2	14	or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.	6
1 Peter	2	15	For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	6
1 Peter	2	16	as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.	6
1 Peter	2	17	Honor all men.  Love the brotherhood.  Fear God. Honor the king.	6
1 Peter	2	18	Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.	6
1 Peter	2	19	For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.	6
1 Peter	2	20	For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.	6
1 Peter	2	21	For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you{TR reads us instead of you} an example, that you should follow his steps,	6
1 Peter	2	22	who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.{Isaiah 53:9}	6
1 Peter	2	23	Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back.  When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;	6
1 Peter	2	24	who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.	6
1 Peter	2	25	For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer{Overseer is from the Greek episkopon, which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent.} of your souls.	6
1 Peter	3	1	In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any don't obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;	6
1 Peter	3	2	seeing your pure behavior in fear.	6
1 Peter	3	3	Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;	6
1 Peter	3	4	but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.	6
1 Peter	3	5	For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:	6
1 Peter	3	6	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.	6
1 Peter	3	7	You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered.	6
1 Peter	3	8	Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,	6
1 Peter	3	9	not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.	6
1 Peter	3	10	For, He who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.	6
1 Peter	3	11	Let him turn away from evil, and do good.  Let him seek peace, and pursue it.	6
1 Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.{Psalm 34:12-16}	6
1 Peter	3	13	Now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?	6
1 Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed.  Don't fear what they fear, neither be troubled.{Isaiah 8:12}	6
1 Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear:	6
1 Peter	3	16	having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good manner of life in Christ.	6
1 Peter	3	17	For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.	6
1 Peter	3	18	Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;	6
1 Peter	3	19	in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,	6
1 Peter	3	20	who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.	6
1 Peter	3	21	This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-- not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,	6
1 Peter	3	22	who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.	6
1 Peter	4	1	Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;	6
1 Peter	4	2	that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.	6
1 Peter	4	3	For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.	6
1 Peter	4	4	They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:	6
1 Peter	4	5	who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.	6
1 Peter	4	6	For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.	6
1 Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is near.  Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.	6
1 Peter	4	8	And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.	6
1 Peter	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.	6
1 Peter	4	10	As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.	6
1 Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.  Amen.	6
1 Peter	4	12	Beloved, don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.	6
1 Peter	4	13	But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.	6
1 Peter	4	14	If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.	6
1 Peter	4	15	For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.	6
1 Peter	4	16	But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.	6
1 Peter	4	17	For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God.  If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God?	6
1 Peter	4	18	If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?{Proverbs 11:31}	6
1 Peter	4	19	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.	6
1 Peter	5	1	I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.	6
1 Peter	5	2	Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;	6
1 Peter	5	3	neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.	6
1 Peter	5	4	When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away.	6
1 Peter	5	5	Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}	6
1 Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;	6
1 Peter	5	7	casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.	6
1 Peter	5	8	Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful.  Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.	6
1 Peter	5	9	Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.	6
1 Peter	5	10	But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.	6
1 Peter	5	11	To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.  Amen.	6
1 Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.	6
1 Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.	6
James	13	25	Grace be with you all.  Amen.	7
James	1	1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion:  Greetings.	7
James	1	2	Count it all joy, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, when you fall into various temptations,	7
James	1	3	knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.	7
James	1	4	Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.	7
James	1	5	But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him.	7
James	1	6	But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.	7
James	1	7	For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.	7
James	1	8	He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.	7
James	1	9	But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;	7
James	1	10	and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.	7
James	1	11	For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes.  So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.	7
James	1	12	Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.	7
James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God can't be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.	7
James	1	14	But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.	7
James	1	15	Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.	7
James	1	16	Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.	7
James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.	7
James	1	18	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.	7
James	1	19	So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;	7
James	1	20	for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.	7
James	1	21	Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls{or, preserve your life.}.	7
James	1	22	But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.	7
James	1	23	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;	7
James	1	24	for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.	7
James	1	25	But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.	7
James	1	26	If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless.	7
James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.	7
James	2	1	My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.	7
James	2	2	For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue{or, meeting}, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;	7
James	2	3	and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, Sit here in a good place; and you tell the poor man, Stand there, or Sit by my footstool;	7
James	2	4	haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?	7
James	2	5	Listen, my beloved brothers.  Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?	7
James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor man.  Don't the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?	7
James	2	7	Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?	7
James	2	8	However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself,{Leviticus 19:18} you do well.	7
James	2	9	But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.	7
James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.	7
James	2	11	For he who said, Do not commit adultery,{Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18} also said, Do not commit murder.{Exodus 10:13; Deuteronomy 5:17} Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.	7
James	2	12	So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.	7
James	2	13	For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.	7
James	2	14	What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works?  Can faith save him?	7
James	2	15	And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,	7
James	2	16	and one of you tells them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs, what good is it?	7
James	2	17	Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.	7
James	2	18	Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith.	7
James	2	19	You believe that God is one.  You do well.  The demons also believe, and shudder.	7
James	2	20	But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?	7
James	2	21	Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?	7
James	2	22	You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;	7
James	2	23	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;{Genesis 15:16} and he was called the friend of God.	7
James	2	24	You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.	7
James	2	25	In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?	7
James	2	26	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.	7
James	3	1	Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.	7
James	3	2	For in many things we all stumble.  If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.	7
James	3	3	Indeed, we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.	7
James	3	4	Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.	7
James	3	5	So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!	7
James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire.  The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.{or, Hell}	7
James	3	7	For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.	7
James	3	8	But nobody can tame the tongue.  It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.	7
James	3	9	With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.	7
James	3	10	Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.	7
James	3	11	Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?	7
James	3	12	Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.	7
James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you?  Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.	7
James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast and don't lie against the truth.	7
James	3	15	This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.	7
James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.	7
James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.	7
James	3	18	Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.	7
James	4	1	Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members?	7
James	4	2	You lust, and don't have.  You kill, covet, and can't obtain. You fight and make war.  You don't have, because you don't ask.	7
James	4	3	You ask, and don't receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.	7
James	4	4	You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?  Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.	7
James	4	5	Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously?	7
James	4	6	But he gives more grace.  Therefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.{Proverbs 3:34}	7
James	4	7	Be subject therefore to God.  But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	7
James	4	8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.  Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.	7
James	4	9	Lament, mourn, and weep.  Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.	7
James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.	7
James	4	11	Don't speak against one another, brothers.  He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law.  But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.	7
James	4	12	Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?	7
James	4	13	Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow let's go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.	7
James	4	14	Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life?  For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.	7
James	4	15	For you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.	7
James	4	16	But now you glory in your boasting.  All such boasting is evil.	7
James	4	17	To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.	7
James	5	1	Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you.	7
James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.	7
James	5	3	Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days.	7
James	5	4	Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)}.	7
James	5	5	You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.	7
James	5	6	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He doesn't resist you.	7
James	5	7	Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain.	7
James	5	8	You also be patient.  Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.	7
James	5	9	Don't grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won't be judged.  Behold, the judge stands at the door.	7
James	5	10	Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.	7
James	5	11	Behold, we call them blessed who endured.  You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the Lord in the outcome, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.	7
James	5	12	But above all things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no; so that you don't fall into hypocrisy.{TR reads under judgment instead of into hypocrisy}	7
James	5	13	Is any among you suffering?  Let him pray.  Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises.	7
James	5	14	Is any among you sick?  Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,	7
James	5	15	and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.  If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.	7
James	5	16	Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.  The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.	7
James	5	17	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months.	7
James	5	18	He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.	7
James	5	19	Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,	7
Luke	16	20	They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed.  Amen.	8
Luke	1	1	Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,	8
Luke	1	2	even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,	8
Luke	1	3	it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;	8
Luke	1	4	that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.	8
Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.	8
Luke	1	6	They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.	8
Luke	1	7	But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.	8
Luke	1	8	Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division,	8
Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.	8
Luke	1	10	The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.	8
Luke	1	11	An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.	8
Luke	1	12	Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.	8
Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him, Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.	8
Luke	1	14	You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.	8
Luke	1	15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink.  He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.	8
Luke	1	16	He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.	8
Luke	1	17	He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.	8
Luke	1	18	Zacharias said to the angel, How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.	8
Luke	1	19	The angel answered him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God.  I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.	8
Luke	1	20	Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.	8
Luke	1	21	The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.	8
Luke	1	22	When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.	8
Luke	1	23	It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.	8
Luke	1	24	After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,	8
Luke	1	25	Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.	8
Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,	8
Luke	1	27	to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David.  The virgin's name was Mary.	8
Luke	1	28	Having come in, the angel said to her, Rejoice, you highly favored one!  The Lord is with you.  Blessed are you among women!	8
Luke	1	29	But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.	8
Luke	1	30	The angel said to her, Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.	8
Luke	1	31	Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'	8
Luke	1	32	He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,	8
Luke	1	33	and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.	8
Luke	1	34	Mary said to the angel, How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?	8
Luke	1	35	The angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.	8
Luke	1	36	Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.	8
Luke	1	37	For everything spoken by God is possible.	8
Luke	1	38	Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.  The angel departed from her.	8
Luke	1	39	Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,	8
Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.	8
Luke	1	41	It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.	8
Luke	1	42	She called out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!	8
Luke	1	43	Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?	8
Luke	1	44	For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!	8
Luke	1	45	Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!	8
Luke	1	46	Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord.	8
Luke	1	47	My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,	8
Luke	1	48	for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.	8
Luke	1	49	For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name.	8
Luke	1	50	His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.	8
Luke	1	51	He has shown strength with his arm.  He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.	8
Luke	1	52	He has put down princes from their thrones.  And has exalted the lowly.	8
Luke	1	53	He has filled the hungry with good things.  He has sent the rich away empty.	8
Luke	1	54	He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,	8
Luke	1	55	As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.	8
Luke	1	56	Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.	8
Luke	1	57	Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.	8
Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.	8
Luke	1	59	It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.	8
Luke	1	60	His mother answered, Not so; but he will be called John.	8
Luke	1	61	They said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.	8
Luke	1	62	They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.	8
Luke	1	63	He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, His name is John. They all marveled.	8
Luke	1	64	His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.	8
Luke	1	65	Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.	8
Luke	1	66	All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be?  The hand of the Lord was with him.	8
Luke	1	67	His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,	8
Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;	8
Luke	1	69	and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David	8
Luke	1	70	(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),	8
Luke	1	71	salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;	8
Luke	1	72	to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,	8
Luke	1	73	the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,	8
Luke	1	74	to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,	8
Luke	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.	8
Luke	1	76	And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,	8
Luke	1	77	to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,	8
Luke	1	78	because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,	8
Luke	1	79	to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.	8
Luke	1	80	The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.	8
Luke	2	1	Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.	8
Luke	2	2	This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.	8
Luke	2	3	All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.	8
Luke	2	4	Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;	8
Luke	2	5	to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.	8
Luke	2	6	It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth.	8
Luke	2	7	She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.	8
Luke	2	8	There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.	8
Luke	2	9	Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.	8
Luke	2	10	The angel said to them, Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.	8
Luke	2	11	For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.	8
Luke	2	12	This is the sign to you:  you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.	8
Luke	2	13	Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,	8
Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men.	8
Luke	2	15	It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, Let's go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.	8
Luke	2	16	They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.	8
Luke	2	17	When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.	8
Luke	2	18	All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.	8
Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.	8
Luke	2	20	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.	8
Luke	2	21	When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.	8
Luke	2	22	When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord	8
Luke	2	23	(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),{Exodus 13:2,12}	8
Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.{Leviticus 12:8}	8
Luke	2	25	Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.	8
Luke	2	26	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.{Christ (Greek) and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean Anointed One}	8
Luke	2	27	He came in the Spirit into the temple.  When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,	8
Luke	2	28	then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,	8
Luke	2	29	Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;	8
Luke	2	30	for my eyes have seen your salvation,	8
Luke	2	31	which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;	8
Luke	2	32	a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.	8
Luke	2	33	Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,	8
Luke	2	34	and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.	8
Luke	2	35	Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.	8
Luke	2	36	There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,	8
Luke	2	37	and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.	8
Luke	2	38	Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.	8
Luke	2	39	When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.	8
Luke	2	40	The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.	8
Luke	2	41	His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.	8
Luke	2	42	When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,	8
Luke	2	43	and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.  Joseph and his mother didn't know it,	8
Luke	2	44	but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.	8
Luke	2	45	When they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.	8
Luke	2	46	It happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.	8
Luke	2	47	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.	8
Luke	2	48	When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.	8
Luke	2	49	He said to them, Why were you looking for me?  Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?	8
Luke	2	50	They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.	8
Luke	2	51	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.	8
Luke	2	52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.	8
Luke	3	1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,	8
Luke	3	2	in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.	8
Luke	3	3	He came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.	8
Luke	3	4	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord.  Make his paths straight.	8
Luke	3	5	Every valley will be filled.  Every mountain and hill will be brought low.  The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.	8
Luke	3	6	All flesh will see God's salvation.'{Isaiah 40:3-5}	8
Luke	3	7	He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?	8
Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!	8
Luke	3	9	Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.	8
Luke	3	10	The multitudes asked him, What then must we do?	8
Luke	3	11	He answered them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none.  He who has food, let him do likewise.	8
Luke	3	12	Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what must we do?	8
Luke	3	13	He said to them, Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.	8
Luke	3	14	Soldiers also asked him, saying, What about us?  What must we do? He said to them, Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully.  Be content with your wages.	8
Luke	3	15	As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,	8
Luke	3	16	John answered them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen.  He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,	8
Luke	3	17	whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.	8
Luke	3	18	Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,	8
Luke	3	19	but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's{TR reads brother Philip's instead of brother's} wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,	8
Luke	3	20	added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.	8
Luke	3	21	Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,	8
Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.	8
Luke	3	23	Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,	8
Luke	3	24	the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,	8
Luke	3	25	the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,	8
Luke	3	26	the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,	8
Luke	3	27	the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,	8
Luke	3	28	the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,	8
Luke	3	29	the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,	8
Luke	3	30	the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,	8
Luke	3	31	the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,	8
Luke	3	32	the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,	8
Luke	3	33	the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram,{NU reads Admin, the son of Arni instead of Aram} the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,	8
Luke	3	34	the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,	8
Luke	3	35	the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,	8
Luke	3	36	the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,	8
Luke	3	37	the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,	8
Luke	3	38	the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.	8
Luke	4	1	Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness	8
Luke	4	2	for forty days, being tempted by the devil.  He ate nothing in those days.  Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.	8
Luke	4	3	The devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.	8
Luke	4	4	Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'{Deuteronomy 8:3}	8
Luke	4	5	The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.	8
Luke	4	6	The devil said to him, I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.	8
Luke	4	7	If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.	8
Luke	4	8	Jesus answered him, Get behind me Satan!  For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'{Deuteronomy 6:13}	8
Luke	4	9	He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,	8
Luke	4	10	for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you;'	8
Luke	4	11	and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'{Psalm 91:11-12}	8
Luke	4	12	Jesus answering, said to him, It has been said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'{Deuteronomy 6:16}	8
Luke	4	13	When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.	8
Luke	4	14	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.	8
Luke	4	15	He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.	8
Luke	4	16	He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.  He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.	8
Luke	4	17	The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,	8
Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,	8
Luke	4	19	and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.{Isaiah 61:1-2}	8
Luke	4	20	He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.	8
Luke	4	21	He began to tell them, Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.	8
Luke	4	22	All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, Isn't this Joseph's son?	8
Luke	4	23	He said to them, Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself!  Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'	8
Luke	4	24	He said, Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.	8
Luke	4	25	But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.	8
Luke	4	26	Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.	8
Luke	4	27	There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.	8
Luke	4	28	They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.	8
Luke	4	29	They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.	8
Luke	4	30	But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.	8
Luke	4	31	He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee.  He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,	8
Luke	4	32	and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.	8
Luke	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,	8
Luke	4	34	saying, Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us?  I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!	8
Luke	4	35	Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him! When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm.	8
Luke	4	36	Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word?  For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!	8
Luke	4	37	News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.	8
Luke	4	38	He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.	8
Luke	4	39	He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.	8
Luke	4	40	When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.	8
Luke	4	41	Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God!  Rebuking them, he didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.	8
Luke	4	42	When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn't go away from them.	8
Luke	4	43	But he said to them, I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also.  For this reason I have been sent.	8
Luke	4	44	He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.	8
Luke	5	1	Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.	8
Luke	5	2	He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.	8
Luke	5	3	He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.	8
Luke	5	4	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.	8
Luke	5	5	Simon answered him, Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.	8
Luke	5	6	When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.	8
Luke	5	7	They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them.  They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.	8
Luke	5	8	But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.	8
Luke	5	9	For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;	8
Luke	5	10	and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.  Jesus said to Simon, Don't be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.	8
Luke	5	11	When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.	8
Luke	5	12	It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy.  When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.	8
Luke	5	13	He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made clean.  Immediately the leprosy left him.	8
Luke	5	14	He charged him to tell no one, But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.	8
Luke	5	15	But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.	8
Luke	5	16	But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.	8
Luke	5	17	It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.	8
Luke	5	18	Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.	8
Luke	5	19	Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.	8
Luke	5	20	Seeing their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.	8
Luke	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies?  Who can forgive sins, but God alone?	8
Luke	5	22	But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?	8
Luke	5	23	Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'	8
Luke	5	24	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.	8
Luke	5	25	Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.	8
Luke	5	26	Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.	8
Luke	5	27	After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, Follow me!	8
Luke	5	28	He left everything, and rose up and followed him.	8
Luke	5	29	Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.	8
Luke	5	30	Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?	8
Luke	5	31	Jesus answered them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.	8
Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.	8
Luke	5	33	They said to him, Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?	8
Luke	5	34	He said to them, Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?	8
Luke	5	35	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them.  Then they will fast in those days.	8
Luke	5	36	He also told a parable to them.  No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.	8
Luke	5	37	No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.	8
Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.	8
Luke	5	39	No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'	8
Luke	6	1	Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields.  His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.	8
Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?	8
Luke	6	3	Jesus, answering them, said, Haven't you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;	8
Luke	6	4	how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?	8
Luke	6	5	He said to them, The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.	8
Luke	6	6	It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught.  There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.	8
Luke	6	7	The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.	8
Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the middle. He arose and stood.	8
Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?	8
Luke	6	10	He looked around at them all, and said to the man, Stretch out your hand.  He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.	8
Luke	6	11	But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.	8
Luke	6	12	It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.	8
Luke	6	13	When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:	8
Luke	6	14	Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;	8
Luke	6	15	Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;	8
Luke	6	16	Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.	8
Luke	6	17	He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;	8
Luke	6	18	as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.	8
Luke	6	19	All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.	8
Luke	6	20	He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	6	21	Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.	8
Luke	6	22	Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.	8
Luke	6	23	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.	8
Luke	6	24	But woe to you who are rich!  For you have received your consolation.	8
Luke	6	25	Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.	8
Luke	6	26	Woe,{TR adds to you} when{TR adds all} men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.	8
Luke	6	27	But I tell you who hear:  love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,	8
Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.	8
Luke	6	29	To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't withhold your coat also.	8
Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.	8
Luke	6	31	As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.	8
Luke	6	32	If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.	8
Luke	6	33	If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?  For even sinners do the same.	8
Luke	6	34	If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you?  Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.	8
Luke	6	35	But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.	8
Luke	6	36	Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful.	8
Luke	6	37	Don't judge, and you won't be judged.  Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned.  Set free, and you will be set free.	8
Luke	6	38	Give, and it will be given to you:  good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you.{literally, into your bosom.} For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.	8
Luke	6	39	He spoke a parable to them.  Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?	8
Luke	6	40	A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.	8
Luke	6	41	Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?	8
Luke	6	42	Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye?  You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye.	8
Luke	6	43	For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit.	8
Luke	6	44	For each tree is known by its own fruit.  For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.	8
Luke	6	45	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.	8
Luke	6	46	Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things which I say?	8
Luke	6	47	Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.	8
Luke	6	48	He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock.  When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.	8
Luke	6	49	But he who hears, and doesn't do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.	8
Luke	7	1	After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.	8
Luke	7	2	A certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.	8
Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.	8
Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for you to do this for him,	8
Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.	8
Luke	7	6	Jesus went with them.  When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.	8
Luke	7	7	Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.	8
Luke	7	8	For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers.  I tell this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.	8
Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.	8
Luke	7	10	Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.	8
Luke	7	11	It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.	8
Luke	7	12	Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.  Many people of the city were with her.	8
Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Don't cry.	8
Luke	7	14	He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, Young man, I tell you, arise!	8
Luke	7	15	He who was dead sat up, and began to speak.  And he gave him to his mother.	8
Luke	7	16	Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us! and, God has visited his people!	8
Luke	7	17	This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.	8
Luke	7	18	The disciples of John told him about all these things.	8
Luke	7	19	John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?	8
Luke	7	20	When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?'	8
Luke	7	21	In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.	8
Luke	7	22	Jesus answered them, Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard:  that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.	8
Luke	7	23	Blessed is he who is not offended by me.	8
Luke	7	24	When John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?	8
Luke	7	25	But what did you go out to see?  A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.	8
Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see?  A prophet?  Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.	8
Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'{Malachi 3:1}	8
Luke	7	28	For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.	8
Luke	7	29	When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John's baptism.	8
Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.	8
Luke	7	31	But the Lord said,{So reads TR.  MT omits But the Lord said,} To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?	8
Luke	7	32	They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'	8
Luke	7	33	For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'	8
Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'	8
Luke	7	35	Wisdom is justified by all her children.	8
Luke	7	36	One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.	8
Luke	7	37	Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.	8
Luke	7	38	Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.	8
Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.	8
Luke	7	40	Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to tell you. He said, Teacher, say on.	8
Luke	7	41	A certain lender had two debtors.  The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.	8
Luke	7	42	When they couldn't pay, he forgave them both.  Which of them therefore will love him most?	8
Luke	7	43	Simon answered, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. He said to him, You have judged correctly.	8
Luke	7	44	Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.	8
Luke	7	45	You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.	8
Luke	7	46	You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.	8
Luke	7	47	Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much.  But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.	8
Luke	7	48	He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.	8
Luke	7	49	Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?	8
Luke	7	50	He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.	8
Luke	8	1	It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God.  With him were the twelve,	8
Luke	8	2	and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities:  Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;	8
Luke	8	3	and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them{TR reads him instead of them} from their possessions.	8
Luke	8	4	When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.	8
Luke	8	5	The farmer went out to sow his seed.  As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.	8
Luke	8	6	Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.	8
Luke	8	7	Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.	8
Luke	8	8	Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.  As he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear!	8
Luke	8	9	Then his disciples asked him, What does this parable mean?	8
Luke	8	10	He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'{Isaiah 6:9}	8
Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this:  The seed is the word of God.	8
Luke	8	12	Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.	8
Luke	8	13	Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.	8
Luke	8	14	That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.	8
Luke	8	15	That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.	8
Luke	8	16	No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.	8
Luke	8	17	For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.	8
Luke	8	18	Be careful therefore how you hear.  For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.	8
Luke	8	19	His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.	8
Luke	8	20	It was told him by some saying, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.	8
Luke	8	21	But he answered them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.	8
Luke	8	22	Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, Let's go over to the other side of the lake. So they launched out.	8
Luke	8	23	But as they sailed, he fell asleep.  A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.	8
Luke	8	24	They came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are dying!  He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.	8
Luke	8	25	He said to them, Where is your faith?  Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?	8
Luke	8	26	They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.	8
Luke	8	27	When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him.  He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.	8
Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God?  I beg you, don't torment me!	8
Luke	8	29	For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.	8
Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him, What is your name?  He said, Legion, for many demons had entered into him.	8
Luke	8	31	They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.	8
Luke	8	32	Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.	8
Luke	8	33	The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.	8
Luke	8	34	When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.	8
Luke	8	35	People went out to see what had happened.  They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.	8
Luke	8	36	Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.	8
Luke	8	37	All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.	8
Luke	8	38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,	8
Luke	8	39	Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.  He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.	8
Luke	8	40	It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.	8
Luke	8	41	Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue.  He fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,	8
Luke	8	42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.  But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.	8
Luke	8	43	A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,	8
Luke	8	44	came behind him, and touched the fringe{or, tassel} of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.	8
Luke	8	45	Jesus said, Who touched me?  When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'	8
Luke	8	46	But Jesus said, Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.	8
Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.	8
Luke	8	48	He said to her, Daughter, cheer up.  Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.	8
Luke	8	49	While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the Teacher.	8
Luke	8	50	But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.	8
Luke	8	51	When he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.	8
Luke	8	52	All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, Don't weep. She isn't dead, but sleeping.	8
Luke	8	53	They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.	8
Luke	8	54	But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, Child, arise!	8
Luke	8	55	Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.	8
Luke	8	56	Her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had been done.	8
Luke	9	1	He called the twelve{TR reads his twelve disciples instead of the twelve} together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.	8
Luke	9	2	He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.	8
Luke	9	3	He said to them, Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.	8
Luke	9	4	Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.	8
Luke	9	5	As many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.	8
Luke	9	6	They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.	8
Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,	8
Luke	9	8	and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.	8
Luke	9	9	Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?  He sought to see him.	8
Luke	9	10	The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.  He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.	8
Luke	9	11	But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.	8
Luke	9	12	The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.	8
Luke	9	13	But he said to them, You give them something to eat. They said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.	8
Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men.  He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.	8
Luke	9	15	They did so, and made them all sit down.	8
Luke	9	16	He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.	8
Luke	9	17	They ate, and were all filled.  They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.	8
Luke	9	18	It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am?	8
Luke	9	19	They answered, 'John the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.	8
Luke	9	20	He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Christ of God.	8
Luke	9	21	But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,	8
Luke	9	22	saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.	8
Luke	9	23	He said to all, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,{TR, NU add daily} and follow me.	8
Luke	9	24	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.	8
Luke	9	25	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?	8
Luke	9	26	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.	8
Luke	9	27	But I tell you the truth:  There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	9	28	It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.	8
Luke	9	29	As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.	8
Luke	9	30	Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,	8
Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure,{literally, exodus} which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.	8
Luke	9	32	Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.	8
Luke	9	33	It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents:  one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.	8
Luke	9	34	While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.	8
Luke	9	35	A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!	8
Luke	9	36	When the voice came, Jesus was found alone.  They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.	8
Luke	9	37	It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.	8
Luke	9	38	Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.	8
Luke	9	39	Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.	8
Luke	9	40	I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn't.	8
Luke	9	41	Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.	8
Luke	9	42	While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently.  But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.	8
Luke	9	43	They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,	8
Luke	9	44	Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.	8
Luke	9	45	But they didn't understand this saying.  It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.	8
Luke	9	46	There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.	8
Luke	9	47	Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,	8
Luke	9	48	and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.  Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.	8
Luke	9	49	John answered, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow with us.	8
Luke	9	50	Jesus said to him, Don't forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.	8
Luke	9	51	It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,	8
Luke	9	52	and sent messengers before his face.  They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.	8
Luke	9	53	They didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.	8
Luke	9	54	When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?	8
Luke	9	55	But he turned and rebuked them, You don't know of what kind of spirit you are.	8
Luke	9	56	For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.  They went to another village.	8
Luke	9	57	As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.	8
Luke	9	58	Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.	8
Luke	9	59	He said to another, Follow me!  But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.	8
Luke	9	60	But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	9	61	Another also said, I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house.	8
Luke	9	62	But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	10	1	Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him{literally, before his face} into every city and place, where he was about to come.	8
Luke	10	2	Then he said to them, The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few.  Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.	8
Luke	10	3	Go your ways.  Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.	8
Luke	10	4	Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals.  Greet no one on the way.	8
Luke	10	5	Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'	8
Luke	10	6	If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.	8
Luke	10	7	Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don't go from house to house.	8
Luke	10	8	Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.	8
Luke	10	9	Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'	8
Luke	10	10	But into whatever city you enter, and they don't receive you, go out into the streets of it and say,	8
Luke	10	11	'Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you.  Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.'	8
Luke	10	12	I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.	8
Luke	10	13	Woe to you, Chorazin!  Woe to you, Bethsaida!  For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.	8
Luke	10	14	But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.	8
Luke	10	15	You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.{Hades is the lower realm of the dead, or Hell.}	8
Luke	10	16	Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me.  Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.	8
Luke	10	17	The seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!	8
Luke	10	18	He said to them, I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.	8
Luke	10	19	Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy.  Nothing will in any way hurt you.	8
Luke	10	20	Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.	8
Luke	10	21	In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children.  Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.	8
Luke	10	22	Turning to the disciples, he said, All things have been delivered to me by my Father.  No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.	8
Luke	10	23	Turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,	8
Luke	10	24	for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.	8
Luke	10	25	Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?	8
Luke	10	26	He said to him, What is written in the law?  How do you read it?	8
Luke	10	27	He answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind;{Deuteronomy 6:5} and your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}	8
Luke	10	28	He said to him, You have answered correctly.  Do this, and you will live.	8
Luke	10	29	But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, Who is my neighbor?	8
Luke	10	30	Jesus answered, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.	8
Luke	10	31	By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.	8
Luke	10	32	In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.	8
Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,	8
Luke	10	34	came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.	8
Luke	10	35	On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'	8
Luke	10	36	Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?	8
Luke	10	37	He said, He who showed mercy on him.  Then Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.	8
Luke	10	38	It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.	8
Luke	10	39	She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.	8
Luke	10	40	But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone?  Ask her therefore to help me.	8
Luke	10	41	Jesus answered her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,	8
Luke	10	42	but one thing is needed.  Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.	8
Luke	11	1	It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.	8
Luke	11	2	He said to them, When you pray, say, 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.  May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.	8
Luke	11	3	Give us day by day our daily bread.	8
Luke	11	4	Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.  Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'	8
Luke	11	5	He said to them, Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,	8
Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'	8
Luke	11	7	and he from within will answer and say, 'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?	8
Luke	11	8	I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.	8
Luke	11	9	I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find.  Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.	8
Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks receives.  He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.	8
Luke	11	11	Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?  Or if he asks for a fish, he won't give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?	8
Luke	11	12	Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, will he?	8
Luke	11	13	If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?	8
Luke	11	14	He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.	8
Luke	11	15	But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.	8
Luke	11	16	Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.	8
Luke	11	17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.	8
Luke	11	18	If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.	8
Luke	11	19	But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out?  Therefore will they be your judges.	8
Luke	11	20	But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.	8
Luke	11	21	When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.	8
Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.	8
Luke	11	23	He that is not with me is against me.  He who doesn't gather with me scatters.	8
Luke	11	24	The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'	8
Luke	11	25	When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.	8
Luke	11	26	Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.	8
Luke	11	27	It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!	8
Luke	11	28	But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.	8
Luke	11	29	When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, This is an evil generation.  It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.	8
Luke	11	30	For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.	8
Luke	11	31	The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.	8
Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it:  for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.	8
Luke	11	33	No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.	8
Luke	11	34	The lamp of the body is the eye.  Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.	8
Luke	11	35	Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness.	8
Luke	11	36	If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.	8
Luke	11	37	Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.	8
Luke	11	38	When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.	8
Luke	11	39	The Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.	8
Luke	11	40	You foolish ones, didn't he who made the outside make the inside also?	8
Luke	11	41	But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.	8
Luke	11	42	But woe to you Pharisees!  For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.	8
Luke	11	43	Woe to you Pharisees!  For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.	8
Luke	11	44	Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don't know it.	8
Luke	11	45	One of the lawyers answered him, Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.	8
Luke	11	46	He said, Woe to you lawyers also!  For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.	8
Luke	11	47	Woe to you!  For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.	8
Luke	11	48	So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.	8
Luke	11	49	Therefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,	8
Luke	11	50	that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;	8
Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.'  Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.	8
Luke	11	52	Woe to you lawyers!  For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.	8
Luke	11	53	As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;	8
Luke	11	54	lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.	8
Luke	12	1	Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.	8
Luke	12	2	But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.	8
Luke	12	3	Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light.  What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.	8
Luke	12	4	I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.	8
Luke	12	5	But I will warn you whom you should fear.  Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna.{or, Hell} Yes, I tell you, fear him.	8
Luke	12	6	Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins{An assarion was a small copper coin worth about an hour's wages for an agricultural laborer.}?  Not one of them is forgotten by God.	8
Luke	12	7	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  Therefore don't be afraid.  You are of more value than many sparrows.	8
Luke	12	8	I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;	8
Luke	12	9	but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.	8
Luke	12	10	Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.	8
Luke	12	11	When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;	8
Luke	12	12	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.	8
Luke	12	13	One of the multitude said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.	8
Luke	12	14	But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?	8
Luke	12	15	He said to them, Beware!  Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.	8
Luke	12	16	He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.	8
Luke	12	17	He reasoned within himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'	8
Luke	12	18	He said, 'This is what I will do.  I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.	8
Luke	12	19	I will tell my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years.  Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.'	8
Luke	12	20	But God said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you.  The things which you have prepared-- whose will they be?'	8
Luke	12	21	So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.	8
Luke	12	22	He said to his disciples, Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.	8
Luke	12	23	Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.	8
Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens:  they don't sow, they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!	8
Luke	12	25	Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?	8
Luke	12	26	If then you aren't able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?	8
Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies, how they grow.  They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.	8
Luke	12	28	But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?	8
Luke	12	29	Don't seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.	8
Luke	12	30	For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.	8
Luke	12	31	But seek God's Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.	8
Luke	12	32	Don't be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.	8
Luke	12	33	Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.	8
Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.	8
Luke	12	35	Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning.	8
Luke	12	36	Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.	8
Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes.  Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.	8
Luke	12	38	They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.	8
Luke	12	39	But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.	8
Luke	12	40	Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him.	8
Luke	12	41	Peter said to him, Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?	8
Luke	12	42	The Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?	8
Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.	8
Luke	12	44	Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.	8
Luke	12	45	But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,	8
Luke	12	46	then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.	8
Luke	12	47	That servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,	8
Luke	12	48	but he who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes.  To whoever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.	8
Luke	12	49	I came to throw fire on the earth.  I wish it were already kindled.	8
Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!	8
Luke	12	51	Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.	8
Luke	12	52	For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.	8
Luke	12	53	They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.	8
Luke	12	54	He said to the multitudes also, When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.	8
Luke	12	55	When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.	8
Luke	12	56	You hypocrites!  You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don't interpret this time?	8
Luke	12	57	Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?	8
Luke	12	58	For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.	8
Luke	12	59	I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.{literally, lepton. A lepton is a very small brass Jewish coin worth half a Roman quadrans each, which is worth a quarter of the copper assarion. Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural worker's daily wages.}	8
Luke	13	1	Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.	8
Luke	13	2	Jesus answered them, Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?	8
Luke	13	3	I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.	8
Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?	8
Luke	13	5	I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.	8
Luke	13	6	He spoke this parable.  A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.	8
Luke	13	7	He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down.  Why does it waste the soil?'	8
Luke	13	8	He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.	8
Luke	13	9	If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'	8
Luke	13	10	He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.	8
Luke	13	11	Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.	8
Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.	8
Luke	13	13	He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.	8
Luke	13	14	The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work.  Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!	8
Luke	13	15	Therefore the Lord answered him, You hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?	8
Luke	13	16	Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?	8
Luke	13	17	As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.	8
Luke	13	18	He said, What is the Kingdom of God like?  To what shall I compare it?	8
Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden.  It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.	8
Luke	13	20	Again he said, To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?	8
Luke	13	21	It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures{literally, three sata.  3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than a bushel} of flour, until it was all leavened.	8
Luke	13	22	He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.	8
Luke	13	23	One said to him, Lord, are they few who are saved? He said to them,	8
Luke	13	24	Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.	8
Luke	13	25	When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'	8
Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'	8
Luke	13	27	He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'	8
Luke	13	28	There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.	8
Luke	13	29	They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	13	30	Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.	8
Luke	13	31	On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.	8
Luke	13	32	He said to them, Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.	8
Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.'	8
Luke	13	34	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!  How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!	8
Luke	13	35	Behold, your house is left to you desolate.  I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'{Psalm 118:26}	8
Luke	14	1	It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.	8
Luke	14	2	Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.	8
Luke	14	3	Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?	8
Luke	14	4	But they were silent.  He took him, and healed him, and let him go.	8
Luke	14	5	He answered them, Which of you, if your son{TR reads donkey instead of son} or an ox fell into a well, wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?	8
Luke	14	6	They couldn't answer him regarding these things.	8
Luke	14	7	He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,	8
Luke	14	8	When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,	8
Luke	14	9	and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.'  Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.	8
Luke	14	10	But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.'  Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.	8
Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.	8
Luke	14	12	He also said to the one who had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.	8
Luke	14	13	But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;	8
Luke	14	14	and you will be blessed, because they don't have the resources to repay you.  For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.	8
Luke	14	15	When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!	8
Luke	14	16	But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.	8
Luke	14	17	He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'	8
Luke	14	18	They all as one began to make excuses.  The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'	8
Luke	14	19	Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out.  Please have me excused.'	8
Luke	14	20	Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come.'	8
Luke	14	21	That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'	8
Luke	14	22	The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'	8
Luke	14	23	The lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.	8
Luke	14	24	For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'	8
Luke	14	25	Now great multitudes were going with him.  He turned and said to them,	8
Luke	14	26	If anyone comes to me, and doesn't hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can't be my disciple.	8
Luke	14	27	Whoever doesn't bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.	8
Luke	14	28	For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?	8
Luke	14	29	Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,	8
Luke	14	30	saying, 'This man began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'	8
Luke	14	31	Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?	8
Luke	14	32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.	8
Luke	14	33	So therefore whoever of you who doesn't renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple.	8
Luke	14	34	Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?	8
Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out.  He who has ears to hear, let him hear.	8
Luke	15	1	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him.	8
Luke	15	2	The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.	8
Luke	15	3	He told them this parable.	8
Luke	15	4	Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?	8
Luke	15	5	When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.	8
Luke	15	6	When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'	8
Luke	15	7	I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.	8
Luke	15	8	Or what woman, if she had ten drachma{A drachma coin was worth about 2 days wages for an agricultural laborer.} coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?	8
Luke	15	9	When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'	8
Luke	15	10	Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.	8
Luke	15	11	He said, A certain man had two sons.	8
Luke	15	12	The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.'  He divided his livelihood between them.	8
Luke	15	13	Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country.  There he wasted his property with riotous living.	8
Luke	15	14	When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.	8
Luke	15	15	He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.	8
Luke	15	16	He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.	8
Luke	15	17	But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!	8
Luke	15	18	I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.	8
Luke	15	19	I am no more worthy to be called your son.  Make me as one of your hired servants.'	8
Luke	15	20	He arose, and came to his father.  But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.	8
Luke	15	21	The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.  I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'	8
Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe, and put it on him.  Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.	8
Luke	15	23	Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;	8
Luke	15	24	for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again.  He was lost, and is found.'  They began to celebrate.	8
Luke	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field.  As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.	8
Luke	15	26	He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.	8
Luke	15	27	He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.'	8
Luke	15	28	But he was angry, and would not go in.  Therefore his father came out, and begged him.	8
Luke	15	29	But he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.	8
Luke	15	30	But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'	8
Luke	15	31	He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.	8
Luke	15	32	But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again.  He was lost, and is found.'	8
Luke	16	1	He also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager.  An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.	8
Luke	16	2	He called him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'	8
Luke	16	3	The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don't have strength to dig.  I am ashamed to beg.	8
Luke	16	4	I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'	8
Luke	16	5	Calling each one of his lord's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'	8
Luke	16	6	He said, 'A hundred batos{100 batos is about 395 litres, 104 U. S. gallons, or 87 imperial gallons.} of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'	8
Luke	16	7	Then said he to another, 'How much do you owe?'  He said, 'A hundred cors{ 100 cors = about 3,910 litres or 600 bushels. } of wheat.'  He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'	8
Luke	16	8	His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.	8
Luke	16	9	I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.	8
Luke	16	10	He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.	8
Luke	16	11	If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?	8
Luke	16	12	If you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?	8
Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other.  You aren't able to serve God and mammon{Mammon refers to riches or a false god of wealth.}.	8
Luke	16	14	The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.	8
Luke	16	15	He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.	8
Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John.  From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.	8
Luke	16	17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.	8
Luke	16	18	Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery.  He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.	8
Luke	16	19	Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.	8
Luke	16	20	A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,	8
Luke	16	21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table.  Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.	8
Luke	16	22	It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom.  The rich man also died, and was buried.	8
Luke	16	23	In Hades{or, Hell}, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.	8
Luke	16	24	He cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue!  For I am in anguish in this flame.'	8
Luke	16	25	But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.	8
Luke	16	26	Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'	8
Luke	16	27	He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;	8
Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'	8
Luke	16	29	But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'	8
Luke	16	30	He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'	8
Luke	16	31	He said to him, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'	8
Luke	17	1	He said to the disciples, It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!	8
Luke	17	2	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.	8
Luke	17	3	Be careful.  If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.	8
Luke	17	4	If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him.	8
Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.	8
Luke	17	6	The Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.	8
Luke	17	7	But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'	8
Luke	17	8	and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?	8
Luke	17	9	Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded?  I think not.	8
Luke	17	10	Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.'	8
Luke	17	11	It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.	8
Luke	17	12	As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance.	8
Luke	17	13	They lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!	8
Luke	17	14	When he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests.  It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.	8
Luke	17	15	One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.	8
Luke	17	16	He fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.	8
Luke	17	17	Jesus answered, Weren't the ten cleansed?  But where are the nine?	8
Luke	17	18	Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?	8
Luke	17	19	Then he said to him, Get up, and go your way.  Your faith has healed you.	8
Luke	17	20	Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The Kingdom of God doesn't come with observation;	8
Luke	17	21	neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.	8
Luke	17	22	He said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.	8
Luke	17	23	They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,	8
Luke	17	24	for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.	8
Luke	17	25	But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.	8
Luke	17	26	As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.	8
Luke	17	27	They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.	8
Luke	17	28	Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot:  they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;	8
Luke	17	29	but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.	8
Luke	17	30	It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.	8
Luke	17	31	In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.	8
Luke	17	32	Remember Lot's wife!	8
Luke	17	33	Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.	8
Luke	17	34	I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.	8
Luke	17	35	There will be two grinding grain together.  One will be taken, and the other will be left.	8
Luke	17	36	{Some Greek manuscripts add:  Two will be in the field: the one taken, and the other left.}	8
Luke	17	37	They answering, asked him, Where, Lord?  He said to them, Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.	8
Luke	18	1	He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,	8
Luke	18	2	saying, There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man.	8
Luke	18	3	A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'	8
Luke	18	4	He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,	8
Luke	18	5	yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'	8
Luke	18	6	The Lord said, Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.	8
Luke	18	7	Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?	8
Luke	18	8	I tell you that he will avenge them quickly.  Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?	8
Luke	18	9	He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.	8
Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.	8
Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.	8
Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week.  I give tithes of all that I get.'	8
Luke	18	13	But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'	8
Luke	18	14	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.	8
Luke	18	15	They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them.  But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.	8
Luke	18	16	Jesus summoned them, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.	8
Luke	18	17	Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.	8
Luke	18	18	A certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?	8
Luke	18	19	Jesus asked him, Why do you call me good?  No one is good, except one--God.	8
Luke	18	20	You know the commandments:  'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'{Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20}	8
Luke	18	21	He said, I have observed all these things from my youth up.	8
Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, You still lack one thing.  Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven.  Come, follow me.	8
Luke	18	23	But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.	8
Luke	18	24	Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!	8
Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	18	26	Those who heard it said, Then who can be saved?	8
Luke	18	27	But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.	8
Luke	18	28	Peter said, Look, we have left everything, and followed you.	8
Luke	18	29	He said to them, Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,	8
Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.	8
Luke	18	31	He took the twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.	8
Luke	18	32	For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.	8
Luke	18	33	They will scourge and kill him.  On the third day, he will rise again.	8
Luke	18	34	They understood none of these things.  This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.	8
Luke	18	35	It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.	8
Luke	18	36	Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.	8
Luke	18	37	They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.	8
Luke	18	38	He cried out, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!	8
Luke	18	39	Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, You son of David, have mercy on me!	8
Luke	18	40	Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,	8
Luke	18	41	What do you want me to do?  He said, Lord, that I may see again.	8
Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him, Receive your sight.  Your faith has healed you.	8
Luke	18	43	Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.	8
Luke	19	1	He entered and was passing through Jericho.	8
Luke	19	2	There was a man named Zacchaeus.  He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.	8
Luke	19	3	He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn't because of the crowd, because he was short.	8
Luke	19	4	He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.	8
Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.	8
Luke	19	6	He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.	8
Luke	19	7	When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.	8
Luke	19	8	Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor.  If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.	8
Luke	19	9	Jesus said to him, Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.	8
Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.	8
Luke	19	11	As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.	8
Luke	19	12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.	8
Luke	19	13	He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins,{10 minas was more than 3 years' wages for an agricultural laborer.} and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'	8
Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'	8
Luke	19	15	It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.	8
Luke	19	16	The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'	8
Luke	19	17	He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant!  Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'	8
Luke	19	18	The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'	8
Luke	19	19	So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'	8
Luke	19	20	Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,	8
Luke	19	21	for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap that which you didn't sow.'	8
Luke	19	22	He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant!  You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I didn't sow.	8
Luke	19	23	Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'	8
Luke	19	24	He said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'	8
Luke	19	25	They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'	8
Luke	19	26	'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.	8
Luke	19	27	But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'	8
Luke	19	28	Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.	8
Luke	19	29	It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage{TR, NU read Bethpage instead of Bethsphage} and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,	8
Luke	19	30	saying, Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat.  Untie it, and bring it.	8
Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'	8
Luke	19	32	Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.	8
Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why are you untying the colt?	8
Luke	19	34	They said, The Lord needs it.	8
Luke	19	35	They brought it to Jesus.  They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.	8
Luke	19	36	As he went, they spread their cloaks in the way.	8
Luke	19	37	As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,	8
Luke	19	38	saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!{Psalm 118:26} Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!	8
Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples!	8
Luke	19	40	He answered them, I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.	8
Luke	19	41	When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,	8
Luke	19	42	saying, If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace!  But now, they are hidden from your eyes.	8
Luke	19	43	For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,	8
Luke	19	44	and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation.	8
Luke	19	45	He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,	8
Luke	19	46	saying to them, It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,'{Isaiah 56:7} but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!{Jeremiah 7:11}	8
Luke	19	47	He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.	8
Luke	19	48	They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.	8
Luke	20	1	It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the {TR adds chief}priests and scribes came to him with the elders.	8
Luke	20	2	They asked him, Tell us:  by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?	8
Luke	20	3	He answered them, I also will ask you one question.  Tell me:	8
Luke	20	4	the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?	8
Luke	20	5	They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?'	8
Luke	20	6	But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.	8
Luke	20	7	They answered that they didn't know where it was from.	8
Luke	20	8	Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.	8
Luke	20	9	He began to tell the people this parable.  A {NU (in brackets) and TR add certain}man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.	8
Luke	20	10	At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.	8
Luke	20	11	He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.	8
Luke	20	12	He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.	8
Luke	20	13	The lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son.  It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.'	8
Luke	20	14	But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir.  Come, let's kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'	8
Luke	20	15	They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?	8
Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.  When they heard it, they said, May it never be!	8
Luke	20	17	But he looked at them, and said, Then what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?'{Psalm 118:22}	8
Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.	8
Luke	20	19	The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.	8
Luke	20	20	They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.	8
Luke	20	21	They asked him, Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.	8
Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?	8
Luke	20	23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why do you test me?	8
Luke	20	24	Show me a denarius.  Whose image and inscription are on it? They answered, Caesar's.	8
Luke	20	25	He said to them, Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.	8
Luke	20	26	They weren't able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.	8
Luke	20	27	Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.	8
Luke	20	28	They asked him, Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.	8
Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brothers.  The first took a wife, and died childless.	8
Luke	20	30	The second took her as wife, and he died childless.	8
Luke	20	31	The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.	8
Luke	20	32	Afterward the woman also died.	8
Luke	20	33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.	8
Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them, The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.	8
Luke	20	35	But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.	8
Luke	20	36	For they can't die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.	8
Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'{Exodus 3:6}	8
Luke	20	38	Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.	8
Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes answered, Teacher, you speak well.	8
Luke	20	40	They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.	8
Luke	20	41	He said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?	8
Luke	20	42	David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,	8
Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.'{Psalm 110:1}	8
Luke	20	44	David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?	8
Luke	20	45	In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,	8
Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;	8
Luke	20	47	who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.	8
Luke	21	1	He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.	8
Luke	21	2	He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins.{literally, two lepta.  2 lepta was about 1% of a day's wages for an agricultural laborer.}	8
Luke	21	3	He said, Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,	8
Luke	21	4	for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.	8
Luke	21	5	As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,	8
Luke	21	6	As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down.	8
Luke	21	7	They asked him, Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?	8
Luke	21	8	He said, Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he{or, I AM},' and, 'The time is at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.	8
Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won't come immediately.	8
Luke	21	10	Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.	8
Luke	21	11	There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places.  There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.	8
Luke	21	12	But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake.	8
Luke	21	13	It will turn out as a testimony for you.	8
Luke	21	14	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,	8
Luke	21	15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.	8
Luke	21	16	You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends.  They will cause some of you to be put to death.	8
Luke	21	17	You will be hated by all men for my name's sake.	8
Luke	21	18	And not a hair of your head will perish.	8
Luke	21	19	By your endurance you will win your lives.	8
Luke	21	20	But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.	8
Luke	21	21	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.	8
Luke	21	22	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.	8
Luke	21	23	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days!  For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.	8
Luke	21	24	They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations.  Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.	8
Luke	21	25	There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;	8
Luke	21	26	men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world:  for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.	8
Luke	21	27	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.	8
Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.	8
Luke	21	29	He told them a parable.  See the fig tree, and all the trees.	8
Luke	21	30	When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.	8
Luke	21	31	Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.	8
Luke	21	32	Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.	8
Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.	8
Luke	21	34	So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.	8
Luke	21	35	For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.	8
Luke	21	36	Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.	8
Luke	21	37	Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.	8
Luke	21	38	All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.	8
Luke	22	1	Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.	8
Luke	22	2	The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.	8
Luke	22	3	Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.	8
Luke	22	4	He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.	8
Luke	22	5	They were glad, and agreed to give him money.	8
Luke	22	6	He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.	8
Luke	22	7	The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.	8
Luke	22	8	He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.	8
Luke	22	9	They said to him, Where do you want us to prepare?	8
Luke	22	10	He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.	8
Luke	22	11	Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'	8
Luke	22	12	He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.	8
Luke	22	13	They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.	8
Luke	22	14	When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.	8
Luke	22	15	He said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,	8
Luke	22	16	for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.	8
Luke	22	17	He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and share it among yourselves,	8
Luke	22	18	for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes.	8
Luke	22	19	He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.	8
Luke	22	20	Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.	8
Luke	22	21	But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.	8
Luke	22	22	The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!	8
Luke	22	23	They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.	8
Luke	22	24	There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.	8
Luke	22	25	He said to them, The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'	8
Luke	22	26	But not so with you.  But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.	8
Luke	22	27	For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it he who sits at the table?  But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.	8
Luke	22	28	But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.	8
Luke	22	29	I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,	8
Luke	22	30	that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.	8
Luke	22	31	The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,	8
Luke	22	32	but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}.	8
Luke	22	33	He said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!	8
Luke	22	34	He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.	8
Luke	22	35	He said to them, When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?  They said, Nothing.	8
Luke	22	36	Then he said to them, But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet.  Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.	8
Luke	22	37	For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me:  'He was counted with the lawless.'{Isaiah 53:12} For that which concerns me has an end.	8
Luke	22	38	They said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.  He said to them, That is enough.	8
Luke	22	39	He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.	8
Luke	22	40	When he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you don't enter into temptation.	8
Luke	22	41	He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,	8
Luke	22	42	saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.	8
Luke	22	43	An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.	8
Luke	22	44	Being in agony he prayed more earnestly.  His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.	8
Luke	22	45	When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,	8
Luke	22	46	and said to them, Why do you sleep?  Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.	8
Luke	22	47	While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.	8
Luke	22	48	But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?	8
Luke	22	49	When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?	8
Luke	22	50	A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.	8
Luke	22	51	But Jesus answered, Let me at least do this--and he touched his ear, and healed him.	8
Luke	22	52	Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?	8
Luke	22	53	When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch out your hands against me.  But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.	8
Luke	22	54	They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house.  But Peter followed from a distance.	8
Luke	22	55	When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.	8
Luke	22	56	A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, This man also was with him.	8
Luke	22	57	He denied Jesus, saying, Woman, I don't know him.	8
Luke	22	58	After a little while someone else saw him, and said, You also are one of them!  But Peter answered, Man, I am not!	8
Luke	22	59	After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!	8
Luke	22	60	But Peter said, Man, I don't know what you are talking about! Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.	8
Luke	22	61	The Lord turned, and looked at Peter.  Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.	8
Luke	22	62	He went out, and wept bitterly.	8
Luke	22	63	The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.	8
Luke	22	64	Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, Prophesy!  Who is the one who struck you?	8
Luke	22	65	They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.	8
Luke	22	66	As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,	8
Luke	22	67	If you are the Christ, tell us.  But he said to them, If I tell you, you won't believe,	8
Luke	22	68	and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.	8
Luke	22	69	From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.	8
Luke	22	70	They all said, Are you then the Son of God?  He said to them, You say it, because I am.	8
Luke	22	71	They said, Why do we need any more witness?  For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!	8
Luke	23	1	The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.	8
Luke	23	2	They began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.	8
Luke	23	3	Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?  He answered him, So you say.	8
Luke	23	4	Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no basis for a charge against this man.	8
Luke	23	5	But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.	8
Luke	23	6	But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.	8
Luke	23	7	When he found out that he was in Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.	8
Luke	23	8	Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him.  He hoped to see some miracle done by him.	8
Luke	23	9	He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.	8
Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.	8
Luke	23	11	Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.	8
Luke	23	12	Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.	8
Luke	23	13	Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,	8
Luke	23	14	and said to them, You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.	8
Luke	23	15	Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.	8
Luke	23	16	I will therefore chastise him and release him.	8
Luke	23	17	Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.	8
Luke	23	18	But they all cried out together, saying, Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!--	8
Luke	23	19	one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.	8
Luke	23	20	Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,	8
Luke	23	21	but they shouted, saying, Crucify!  Crucify him!	8
Luke	23	22	He said to them the third time, Why?  What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him.  I will therefore chastise him and release him.	8
Luke	23	23	But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified.  Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.	8
Luke	23	24	Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.	8
Luke	23	25	He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.	8
Luke	23	26	When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.	8
Luke	23	27	A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.	8
Luke	23	28	But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.	8
Luke	23	29	For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'	8
Luke	23	30	Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'{Hosea 10:8}	8
Luke	23	31	For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?	8
Luke	23	32	There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.	8
Luke	23	33	When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.	8
Luke	23	34	Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing.  Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.	8
Luke	23	35	The people stood watching.  The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others.  Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!	8
Luke	23	36	The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,	8
Luke	23	37	and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!	8
Luke	23	38	An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:  THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.	8
Luke	23	39	One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!	8
Luke	23	40	But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?	8
Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.	8
Luke	23	42	He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.	8
Luke	23	43	Jesus said to him, Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.	8
Luke	23	44	It was now about the sixth hour{Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.}, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.{3:00 PM}	8
Luke	23	45	The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.	8
Luke	23	46	Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!  Having said this, he breathed his last.	8
Luke	23	47	When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.	8
Luke	23	48	All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.	8
Luke	23	49	All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.	8
Luke	23	50	Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man	8
Luke	23	51	(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:	8
Luke	23	52	this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.	8
Luke	23	53	He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.	8
Luke	23	54	It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.	8
Luke	23	55	The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.	8
Luke	23	56	They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.	8
Luke	24	1	But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.	8
Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.	8
Luke	24	3	They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body.	8
Luke	24	4	It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.	8
Luke	24	5	Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?	8
Luke	24	6	He isn't here, but is risen.  Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,	8
Luke	24	7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?	8
Luke	24	8	They remembered his words,	8
Luke	24	9	returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.	8
Luke	24	10	Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.	8
Luke	24	11	These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn't believe them.	8
Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.  Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.	8
Luke	24	13	Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia{60 stadia = about 11 kilometers or about 7 miles.} from Jerusalem.	8
Luke	24	14	They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.	8
Luke	24	15	It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.	8
Luke	24	16	But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.	8
Luke	24	17	He said to them, What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?	8
Luke	24	18	One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days?	8
Luke	24	19	He said to them, What things?  They said to him, The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;	8
Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.	8
Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.	8
Luke	24	22	Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;	8
Luke	24	23	and when they didn't find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.	8
Luke	24	24	Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn't see him.	8
Luke	24	25	He said to them, Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!	8
Luke	24	26	Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?	8
Luke	24	27	Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.	8
Luke	24	28	They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.	8
Luke	24	29	They urged him, saying, Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.  He went in to stay with them.	8
Luke	24	30	It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.  Breaking it, he gave to them.	8
Luke	24	31	Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.	8
Luke	24	32	They said one to another, Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?	8
Luke	24	33	They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,	8
Luke	24	34	saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!	8
Luke	24	35	They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.	8
Luke	24	36	As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, Peace be to you.	8
Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.	8
Luke	24	38	He said to them, Why are you troubled?  Why do doubts arise in your hearts?	8
Luke	24	39	See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.	8
Luke	24	40	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.	8
Luke	24	41	While they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Do you have anything here to eat?	8
Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.	8
Luke	24	43	He took them, and ate in front of them.	8
Luke	24	44	He said to them, This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.	8
Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.	8
Luke	24	46	He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,	8
Luke	24	47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.	8
Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things.	8
Luke	24	49	Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.	8
Luke	24	50	He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.	8
Luke	24	51	It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.	8
Luke	24	52	They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,	8
John	24	53	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.  Amen.	9
John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.	9
John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God.	9
John	1	3	All things were made through him.  Without him was not anything made that has been made.	9
John	1	4	In him was life, and the life was the light of men.	9
John	1	5	The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome{The word translated overcome (katelaben) can also be translated comprehended. It refers to getting a grip on an enemy to defeat him.} it.	9
John	1	6	There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.	9
John	1	7	The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.	9
John	1	8	He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.	9
John	1	9	The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.	9
John	1	10	He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn't recognize him.	9
John	1	11	He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him.	9
John	1	12	But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name:	9
John	1	13	who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.	9
John	1	14	The Word became flesh, and lived among us.  We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.	9
John	1	15	John testified about him.  He cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'	9
John	1	16	From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.	9
John	1	17	For the law was given through Moses.  Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.	9
John	1	18	No one has seen God at any time.  The one and only Son,{NU reads God} who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.	9
John	1	19	This is John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?	9
John	1	20	He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, I am not the Christ.	9
John	1	21	They asked him, What then?  Are you Elijah?  He said, I am not. Are you the Prophet?  He answered, No.	9
John	1	22	They said therefore to him, Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?	9
John	1	23	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,'{Isaiah 40:3} as Isaiah the prophet said.	9
John	1	24	The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.	9
John	1	25	They asked him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?	9
John	1	26	John answered them, I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know.	9
John	1	27	He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen.	9
John	1	28	These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.	9
John	1	29	The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!	9
John	1	30	This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'	9
John	1	31	I didn't know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.	9
John	1	32	John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.	9
John	1	33	I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'	9
John	1	34	I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.	9
John	1	35	Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,	9
John	1	36	and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God!	9
John	1	37	The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.	9
John	1	38	Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What are you looking for?  They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where are you staying?	9
John	1	39	He said to them, Come, and see.  They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.{4:00 PM.}	9
John	1	40	One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.	9
John	1	41	He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah! (which is, being interpreted, Christ{Messiah (Hebrew) and Christ (Greek) both mean Anointed One.}).	9
John	1	42	He brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him, and said, You are Simon the son of Jonah.  You shall be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).	9
John	1	43	On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip.  Jesus said to him, Follow me.	9
John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.	9
John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.	9
John	1	46	Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?  Philip said to him, Come and see.	9
John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!	9
John	1	48	Nathanael said to him, How do you know me?  Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.	9
John	1	49	Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God!  You are King of Israel!	9
John	1	50	Jesus answered him, Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe?  You will see greater things than these!	9
John	1	51	He said to him, Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.	9
John	2	1	The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there.	9
John	2	2	Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.	9
John	2	3	When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, They have no wine.	9
John	2	4	Jesus said to her, Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.	9
John	2	5	His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it.	9
John	2	6	Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes{2 to 3 metretes is about 20 to 30 U. S. Gallons, 16 to 25 imperial gallons, or 75 to 115 litres.} apiece.	9
John	2	7	Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. They filled them up to the brim.	9
John	2	8	He said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.  So they took it.	9
John	2	9	When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,	9
John	2	10	and said to him, Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!	9
John	2	11	This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.	9
John	2	12	After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.	9
John	2	13	The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	9
John	2	14	He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.	9
John	2	15	He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.	9
John	2	16	To those who sold the doves, he said, Take these things out of here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!	9
John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up.{Psalm 69:9}	9
John	2	18	The Jews therefore answered him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?	9
John	2	19	Jesus answered them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.	9
John	2	20	The Jews therefore said, Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?	9
John	2	21	But he spoke of the temple of his body.	9
John	2	22	When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.	9
John	2	23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.	9
John	2	24	But Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,	9
John	2	25	and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.	9
John	3	1	Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.	9
John	3	2	The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.	9
John	3	3	Jesus answered him, Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew,{The word translated anew here and in John 3:7 (anothen) also means again and from above.} he can't see the Kingdom of God.	9
John	3	4	Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?	9
John	3	5	Jesus answered, Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God!	9
John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.	9
John	3	7	Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'	9
John	3	8	The wind{The same Greek word (pneuma) means wind, breath, and spirit.} blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.	9
John	3	9	Nicodemus answered him, How can these things be?	9
John	3	10	Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand these things?	9
John	3	11	Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness.	9
John	3	12	If I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?	9
John	3	13	No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.	9
John	3	14	As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,	9
John	3	15	that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.	9
John	3	16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.	9
John	3	17	For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.	9
John	3	18	He who believes in him is not judged.  He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.	9
John	3	19	This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.	9
John	3	20	For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.	9
John	3	21	But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.	9
John	3	22	After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea.  He stayed there with them, and baptized.	9
John	3	23	John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.  They came, and were baptized.	9
John	3	24	For John was not yet thrown into prison.	9
John	3	25	There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with some Jews about purification.	9
John	3	26	They came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.	9
John	3	27	John answered, A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.	9
John	3	28	You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'	9
John	3	29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.  This, my joy, therefore is made full.	9
John	3	30	He must increase, but I must decrease.	9
John	3	31	He who comes from above is above all.  He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.	9
John	3	32	What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.	9
John	3	33	He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.	9
John	3	34	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.	9
John	3	35	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.	9
John	3	36	One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys{The same word can be translated disobeys or disbelieves in this context.} the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.	9
John	4	1	Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John	9
John	4	2	(although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),	9
John	4	3	he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.	9
John	4	4	He needed to pass through Samaria.	9
John	4	5	So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.	9
John	4	6	Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well.  It was about the sixth hour{noon}.	9
John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water.  Jesus said to her, Give me a drink.	9
John	4	8	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.	9
John	4	9	The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)	9
John	4	10	Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.	9
John	4	11	The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.  From where then have you that living water?	9
John	4	12	Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?	9
John	4	13	Jesus answered her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,	9
John	4	14	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.	9
John	4	15	The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.	9
John	4	16	Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.	9
John	4	17	The woman answered, I have no husband.  Jesus said to her, You said well, 'I have no husband,'	9
John	4	18	for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband.  This you have said truly.	9
John	4	19	The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.	9
John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.	9
John	4	21	Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.	9
John	4	22	You worship that which you don't know.  We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.	9
John	4	23	But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.	9
John	4	24	God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.	9
John	4	25	The woman said to him, I know that Messiah comes, (he who is called Christ).  When he has come, he will declare to us all things.	9
John	4	26	Jesus said to her, I am he, the one who speaks to you.	9
John	4	27	At this, his disciples came.  They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are you looking for? or, Why do you speak with her?	9
John	4	28	So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,	9
John	4	29	Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?	9
John	4	30	They went out of the city, and were coming to him.	9
John	4	31	In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat.	9
John	4	32	But he said to them, I have food to eat that you don't know about.	9
John	4	33	The disciples therefore said one to another, Has anyone brought him something to eat?	9
John	4	34	Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.	9
John	4	35	Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.	9
John	4	36	He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.	9
John	4	37	For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'	9
John	4	38	I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.	9
John	4	39	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me everything that I did.	9
John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them.  He stayed there two days.	9
John	4	41	Many more believed because of his word.	9
John	4	42	They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.	9
John	4	43	After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.	9
John	4	44	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.	9
John	4	45	So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.	9
John	4	46	Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine.  There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.	9
John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.	9
John	4	48	Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.	9
John	4	49	The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.	9
John	4	50	Jesus said to him, Go your way.  Your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.	9
John	4	51	As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying Your child lives!	9
John	4	52	So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour,{1:00 P. M.} the fever left him.	9
John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives.  He believed, as did his whole house.	9
John	4	54	This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.	9
John	5	1	After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	9
John	5	2	Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.	9
John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;	9
John	5	4	for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water.  Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.	9
John	5	5	A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.	9
John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, Do you want to be made well?	9
John	5	7	The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me.	9
John	5	8	Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your mat, and walk.	9
John	5	9	Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.	9
John	5	10	So the Jews said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.	9
John	5	11	He answered them, He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'	9
John	5	12	Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your mat, and walk'?	9
John	5	13	But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.	9
John	5	14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made well.  Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.	9
John	5	15	The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.	9
John	5	16	For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.	9
John	5	17	But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working, so I am working, too.	9
John	5	18	For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.	9
John	5	19	Jesus therefore answered them, Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.	9
John	5	20	For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does.  He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.	9
John	5	21	For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.	9
John	5	22	For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,	9
John	5	23	that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.	9
John	5	24	Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.	9
John	5	25	Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those who hear will live.	9
John	5	26	For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.	9
John	5	27	He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.	9
John	5	28	Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,	9
John	5	29	and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.	9
John	5	30	I can of myself do nothing.  As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.	9
John	5	31	If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.	9
John	5	32	It is another who testifies about me.  I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.	9
John	5	33	You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.	9
John	5	34	But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.	9
John	5	35	He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.	9
John	5	36	But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.	9
John	5	37	The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.	9
John	5	38	You don't have his word living in you; because you don't believe him whom he sent.	9
John	5	39	You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.	9
John	5	40	Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.	9
John	5	41	I don't receive glory from men.	9
John	5	42	But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.	9
John	5	43	I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.	9
John	5	44	How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?	9
John	5	45	Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.	9
John	5	46	For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.	9
John	5	47	But if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe my words?	9
John	6	1	After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.	9
John	6	2	A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.	9
John	6	3	Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.	9
John	6	4	Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.	9
John	6	5	Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?	9
John	6	6	This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.	9
John	6	7	Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.	9
John	6	8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,	9
John	6	9	There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?	9
John	6	10	Jesus said, Have the people sit down.  Now there was much grass in that place.  So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.	9
John	6	11	Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.	9
John	6	12	When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.	9
John	6	13	So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.	9
John	6	14	When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.	9
John	6	15	Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.	9
John	6	16	When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,	9
John	6	17	and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum.  It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.	9
John	6	18	The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.	9
John	6	19	When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,{25 to 30 stadia is about 5 to 6 kilometers or about 3 to 4 miles} they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.	9
John	6	20	But he said to them, It is I{or, I AM}. Don't be afraid.	9
John	6	21	They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.	9
John	6	22	On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.	9
John	6	23	However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.	9
John	6	24	When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.	9
John	6	25	When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, Rabbi, when did you come here?	9
John	6	26	Jesus answered them, Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.	9
John	6	27	Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.	9
John	6	28	They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?	9
John	6	29	Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.	9
John	6	30	They said therefore to him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you?  What work do you do?	9
John	6	31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.  As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven{Greek and Hebrew use the same word for heaven, the heavens, the sky, and the air.} to eat.'{Exodus 16:4; Nehemiah 9:15; Psalm 78:24-25}	9
John	6	32	Jesus therefore said to them, Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.	9
John	6	33	For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.	9
John	6	34	They said therefore to him, Lord, always give us this bread.	9
John	6	35	Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.  He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.	9
John	6	36	But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.	9
John	6	37	All those who the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.	9
John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.	9
John	6	39	This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.	9
John	6	40	This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.	9
John	6	41	The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.	9
John	6	42	They said, Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?  How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'	9
John	6	43	Therefore Jesus answered them, Don't murmur among yourselves.	9
John	6	44	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.	9
John	6	45	It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.'{Isaiah 54:13} Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.	9
John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.	9
John	6	47	Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.	9
John	6	48	I am the bread of life.	9
John	6	49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.	9
John	6	50	This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.	9
John	6	51	I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.	9
John	6	52	The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?	9
John	6	53	Jesus therefore said to them, Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don't have life in yourselves.	9
John	6	54	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.	9
John	6	55	For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.	9
John	6	56	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.	9
John	6	57	As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.	9
John	6	58	This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna, and died.  He who eats this bread will live forever.	9
John	6	59	These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.	9
John	6	60	Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying!  Who can listen to it?	9
John	6	61	But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?	9
John	6	62	Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?	9
John	6	63	It is the spirit who gives life.  The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.	9
John	6	64	But there are some of you who don't believe.  For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him.	9
John	6	65	He said, For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.	9
John	6	66	At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.	9
John	6	67	Jesus said therefore to the twelve, You don't also want to go away, do you?	9
John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.	9
John	6	69	We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.	9
John	6	70	Jesus answered them, Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?	9
John	6	71	Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.	9
John	7	1	After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.	9
John	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.	9
John	7	3	His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.	9
John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly.  If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.	9
John	7	5	For even his brothers didn't believe in him.	9
John	7	6	Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.	9
John	7	7	The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.	9
John	7	8	You go up to the feast.  I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.	9
John	7	9	Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.	9
John	7	10	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.	9
John	7	11	The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?	9
John	7	12	There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, He is a good man.  Others said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.	9
John	7	13	Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.	9
John	7	14	But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.	9
John	7	15	The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never been educated?	9
John	7	16	Jesus therefore answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.	9
John	7	17	If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.	9
John	7	18	He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.	9
John	7	19	Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?	9
John	7	20	The multitude answered, You have a demon!  Who seeks to kill you?	9
John	7	21	Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.	9
John	7	22	Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.	9
John	7	23	If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?	9
John	7	24	Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.	9
John	7	25	Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?	9
John	7	26	Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?	9
John	7	27	However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.	9
John	7	28	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know me, and know where I am from.  I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know.	9
John	7	29	I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.	9
John	7	30	They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.	9
John	7	31	But of the multitude, many believed in him.  They said, When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?	9
John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.	9
John	7	33	Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.	9
John	7	34	You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come.	9
John	7	35	The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we won't find him?  Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?	9
John	7	36	What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come'?	9
John	7	37	Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!	9
John	7	38	He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.	9
John	7	39	But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive.  For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.	9
John	7	40	Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the prophet.	9
John	7	41	Others said, This is the Christ.  But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?	9
John	7	42	Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David,{2 Samuel 7:12} and from Bethlehem,{Micah 5:2} the village where David was?	9
John	7	43	So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.	9
John	7	44	Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.	9
John	7	45	The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why didn't you bring him?	9
John	7	46	The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this man!	9
John	7	47	The Pharisees therefore answered them, You aren't also led astray, are you?	9
John	7	48	Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?	9
John	7	49	But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed.	9
John	7	50	Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,	9
John	7	51	Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?	9
John	7	52	They answered him, Are you also from Galilee?  Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.{See Isaiah 9:1 and Matthew 4:13-16.}	9
John	7	53	Everyone went to his own house,	9
John	8	1	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.	9
John	8	2	Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him.  He sat down, and taught them.	9
John	8	3	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,	9
John	8	4	they told him, Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.	9
John	8	5	Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such.{Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22} What then do you say about her?	9
John	8	6	They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of.  But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.	9
John	8	7	But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.	9
John	8	8	Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.	9
John	8	9	They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.	9
John	8	10	Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, Woman, where are your accusers?  Did no one condemn you?	9
John	8	11	She said, No one, Lord.  Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you. Go your way.  From now on, sin no more.	9
John	8	12	Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world.{Isaiah 60:1} He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.	9
John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said to him, You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.	9
John	8	14	Jesus answered them, Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.	9
John	8	15	You judge according to the flesh.  I judge no one.	9
John	8	16	Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.	9
John	8	17	It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.{Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15}	9
John	8	18	I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.	9
John	8	19	They said therefore to him, Where is your Father?  Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father.  If you knew me, you would know my Father also.	9
John	8	20	Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.	9
John	8	21	Jesus said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come.	9
John	8	22	The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you can't come?'	9
John	8	23	He said to them, You are from beneath.  I am from above. You are of this world.  I am not of this world.	9
John	8	24	I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I AM he, you will die in your sins.	9
John	8	25	They said therefore to him, Who are you?  Jesus said to them, Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.	9
John	8	26	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.	9
John	8	27	They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the Father.	9
John	8	28	Jesus therefore said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things.	9
John	8	29	He who sent me is with me.  The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.	9
John	8	30	As he spoke these things, many believed in him.	9
John	8	31	Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.	9
John	8	32	You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.{Psalm 119:45}	9
John	8	33	They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone.  How do you say, 'You will be made free?'	9
John	8	34	Jesus answered them, Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.	9
John	8	35	A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever.	9
John	8	36	If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.	9
John	8	37	I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.	9
John	8	38	I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.	9
John	8	39	They answered him, Our father is Abraham.  Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.	9
John	8	40	But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God.  Abraham didn't do this.	9
John	8	41	You do the works of your father.  They said to him, We were not born of sexual immorality.  We have one Father, God.	9
John	8	42	Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.	9
John	8	43	Why don't you understand my speech?  Because you can't hear my word.	9
John	8	44	You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.  He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.	9
John	8	45	But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.	9
John	8	46	Which of you convicts me of sin?  If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?	9
John	8	47	He who is of God hears the words of God.  For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God.	9
John	8	48	Then the Jews answered him, Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?	9
John	8	49	Jesus answered, I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.	9
John	8	50	But I don't seek my own glory.  There is one who seeks and judges.	9
John	8	51	Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.	9
John	8	52	Then the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'	9
John	8	53	Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died.  Who do you make yourself out to be?	9
John	8	54	Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.	9
John	8	55	You have not known him, but I know him.  If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar.  But I know him, and keep his word.	9
John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.  He saw it, and was glad.	9
John	8	57	The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?	9
John	8	58	Jesus said to them, Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.	9
John	8	59	Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst of them, and so passed by.	9
John	9	1	As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.	9
John	9	2	His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?	9
John	9	3	Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.	9
John	9	4	I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.	9
John	9	5	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.	9
John	9	6	When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,	9
John	9	7	and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which means Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.	9
John	9	8	The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, Isn't this he who sat and begged?	9
John	9	9	Others were saying, It is he.  Still others were saying, He looks like him.  He said, I am he.	9
John	9	10	They therefore were asking him, How were your eyes opened?	9
John	9	11	He answered, A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight.	9
John	9	12	Then they asked him, Where is he?  He said, I don't know.	9
John	9	13	They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.	9
John	9	14	It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.	9
John	9	15	Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight.  He said to them, He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.	9
John	9	16	Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? There was division among them.	9
John	9	17	Therefore they asked the blind man again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?  He said, He is a prophet.	9
John	9	18	The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,	9
John	9	19	and asked them, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?	9
John	9	20	His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;	9
John	9	21	but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know.  He is of age.  Ask him. He will speak for himself.	9
John	9	22	His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.	9
John	9	23	Therefore his parents said, He is of age.  Ask him.	9
John	9	24	So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God.  We know that this man is a sinner.	9
John	9	25	He therefore answered, I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know:  that though I was blind, now I see.	9
John	9	26	They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?	9
John	9	27	He answered them, I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again?  You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?	9
John	9	28	They insulted him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.	9
John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses.  But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from.	9
John	9	30	The man answered them, How amazing!  You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.	9
John	9	31	We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.{Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9}	9
John	9	32	Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.	9
John	9	33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.	9
John	9	34	They answered him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?  They threw him out.	9
John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of God?	9
John	9	36	He answered, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?	9
John	9	37	Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.	9
John	9	38	He said, Lord, I believe! and he worshiped him.	9
John	9	39	Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind.	9
John	9	40	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind?	9
John	9	41	Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.'  Therefore your sin remains.	9
John	10	1	Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.	9
John	10	2	But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.	9
John	10	3	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice.  He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.	9
John	10	4	Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.	9
John	10	5	They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the voice of strangers.	9
John	10	6	Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what he was telling them.	9
John	10	7	Jesus therefore said to them again, Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door.	9
John	10	8	All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.	9
John	10	9	I am the door.  If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.	9
John	10	10	The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.	9
John	10	11	I am the good shepherd.{Isaiah 40:11; Ezekiel 34:11-12,15,22} The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.	9
John	10	12	He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.	9
John	10	13	The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep.	9
John	10	14	I am the good shepherd.  I know my own, and I'm known by my own;	9
John	10	15	even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.	9
John	10	16	I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.{Isaiah 56:8} I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.	9
John	10	17	Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,{Isaiah 53:7-8} that I may take it again.	9
John	10	18	No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.	9
John	10	19	Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.	9
John	10	20	Many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?	9
John	10	21	Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?{Exodus 4:11}	9
John	10	22	It was the Feast of the Dedication{The Feast of the Dedication is the Greek name for Chanukkah, a celebration of the rededication of the Temple.} at Jerusalem.	9
John	10	23	It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch.	9
John	10	24	The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, How long will you hold us in suspense?  If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.	9
John	10	25	Jesus answered them, I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me.	9
John	10	26	But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.	9
John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.	9
John	10	28	I give eternal life to them.  They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.	9
John	10	29	My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.	9
John	10	30	I and the Father are one.	9
John	10	31	Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.	9
John	10	32	Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father.  For which of those works do you stone me?	9
John	10	33	The Jews answered him, We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy:  because you, being a man, make yourself God.	9
John	10	34	Jesus answered them, Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?'{Psalm 82:6}	9
John	10	35	If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),	9
John	10	36	do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?'	9
John	10	37	If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.	9
John	10	38	But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.	9
John	10	39	They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.	9
John	10	40	He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.	9
John	10	41	Many came to him.  They said, John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true.	9
John	10	42	Many believed in him there.	9
John	11	1	Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.	9
John	11	2	It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.	9
John	11	3	The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.	9
John	11	4	But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it.	9
John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.	9
John	11	6	When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.	9
John	11	7	Then after this he said to the disciples, Let's go into Judea again.	9
John	11	8	The disciples told him, Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?	9
John	11	9	Jesus answered, Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.	9
John	11	10	But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn't in him.	9
John	11	11	He said these things, and after that, he said to them, Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.	9
John	11	12	The disciples therefore said, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.	9
John	11	13	Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.	9
John	11	14	So Jesus said to them plainly then, Lazarus is dead.	9
John	11	15	I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe.  Nevertheless, let's go to him.	9
John	11	16	Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus,{Didymus means Twin} said to his fellow disciples, Let's go also, that we may die with him.	9
John	11	17	So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.	9
John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia{15 stadia is about 2.8 kilometers or 1.7 miles} away.	9
John	11	19	Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.	9
John	11	20	Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.	9
John	11	21	Therefore Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died.	9
John	11	22	Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.	9
John	11	23	Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.	9
John	11	24	Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.	9
John	11	25	Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.	9
John	11	26	Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?	9
John	11	27	She said to him, Yes, Lord.  I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world.	9
John	11	28	When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and is calling you.	9
John	11	29	When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.	9
John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.	9
John	11	31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.	9
John	11	32	Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died.	9
John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,	9
John	11	34	and said, Where have you laid him?  They told him, Lord, come and see.	9
John	11	35	Jesus wept.	9
John	11	36	The Jews therefore said, See how much affection he had for him!	9
John	11	37	Some of them said, Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?	9
John	11	38	Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.	9
John	11	39	Jesus said, Take away the stone.  Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.	9
John	11	40	Jesus said to her, Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?	9
John	11	41	So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying.{NU omits from the place where the dead man was lying.} Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you listened to me.	9
John	11	42	I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.	9
John	11	43	When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!	9
John	11	44	He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.  Jesus said to them, Free him, and let him go.	9
John	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.	9
John	11	46	But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.	9
John	11	47	The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing?  For this man does many signs.	9
John	11	48	If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.	9
John	11	49	But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,	9
John	11	50	nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.	9
John	11	51	Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,	9
John	11	52	and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.	9
John	11	53	So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.	9
John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim.  He stayed there with his disciples.	9
John	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand.  Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.	9
John	11	56	Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think--that he isn't coming to the feast at all?	9
John	11	57	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.	9
John	12	1	Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.	9
John	12	2	So they made him a supper there.  Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.	9
John	12	3	Mary, therefore, took a pound{a Roman pound of 12 ounces, or about 340 grams} of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.	9
John	12	4	Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,	9
John	12	5	Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,{300 denarii was about a year's wages for an agricultural laborer.} and given to the poor?	9
John	12	6	Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.	9
John	12	7	But Jesus said, Leave her alone.  She has kept this for the day of my burial.	9
John	12	8	For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me.	9
John	12	9	A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.	9
John	12	10	But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,	9
John	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.	9
John	12	12	On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,	9
John	12	13	they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna{Hosanna means save us or help us, we pray.}!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,{Psalm 118:25-26} the King of Israel!	9
John	12	14	Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,	9
John	12	15	Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion.  Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt.{Zechariah 9:9}	9
John	12	16	His disciples didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.	9
John	12	17	The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.	9
John	12	18	For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.	9
John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, See how you accomplish nothing.  Behold, the world has gone after him.	9
John	12	20	Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.	9
John	12	21	These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.	9
John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.	9
John	12	23	Jesus answered them, The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.	9
John	12	24	Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.	9
John	12	25	He who loves his life will lose it.  He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.	9
John	12	26	If anyone serves me, let him follow me.  Where I am, there will my servant also be.  If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.	9
John	12	27	Now my soul is troubled.  What shall I say?  'Father, save me from this time?'  But for this cause I came to this time.	9
John	12	28	Father, glorify your name!  Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.	9
John	12	29	The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered.  Others said, An angel has spoken to him.	9
John	12	30	Jesus answered, This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.	9
John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world.  Now the prince of this world will be cast out.	9
John	12	32	And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.	9
John	12	33	But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.	9
John	12	34	The multitude answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.{Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44 (but see also Isaiah 53:8)} How do you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?'  Who is this Son of Man?	9
John	12	35	Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while the light is with you.  Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't overtake you.  He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going.	9
John	12	36	While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light.  Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.	9
John	12	37	But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe in him,	9
John	12	38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?{Isaiah 53:1}	9
John	12	39	For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,	9
John	12	40	He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them.{Isaiah 6:10}	9
John	12	41	Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.{Isaiah 6:1}	9
John	12	42	Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it, so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,	9
John	12	43	for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.	9
John	12	44	Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.	9
John	12	45	He who sees me sees him who sent me.	9
John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.	9
John	12	47	If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge him.  For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.	9
John	12	48	He who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one who judges him.  The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.	9
John	12	49	For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.	9
John	12	50	I know that his commandment is eternal life.  The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.	9
John	13	1	Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.	9
John	13	2	After supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,	9
John	13	3	Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,	9
John	13	4	arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.	9
John	13	5	Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.	9
John	13	6	Then he came to Simon Peter.  He said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?	9
John	13	7	Jesus answered him, You don't know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.	9
John	13	8	Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I don't wash you, you have no part with me.	9
John	13	9	Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!	9
John	13	10	Jesus said to him, Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean.  You are clean, but not all of you.	9
John	13	11	For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, You are not all clean.	9
John	13	12	So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?	9
John	13	13	You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am.	9
John	13	14	If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.	9
John	13	15	For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.	9
John	13	16	Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.	9
John	13	17	If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.	9
John	13	18	I don't speak concerning all of you.  I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.'{Psalm 41:9}	9
John	13	19	From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.	9
John	13	20	Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.	9
John	13	21	When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.	9
John	13	22	The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.	9
John	13	23	One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast.	9
John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.	9
John	13	25	He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him, Lord, who is it?	9
John	13	26	Jesus therefore answered, It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it. So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.	9
John	13	27	After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.	9
John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.	9
John	13	29	For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.	9
John	13	30	Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.	9
John	13	31	When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.	9
John	13	32	If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.	9
John	13	33	Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell you.	9
John	13	34	A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.	9
John	13	35	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.	9
John	13	36	Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered, Where I am going, you can't follow now, but you will follow afterwards.	9
John	13	37	Peter said to him, Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.	9
John	13	38	Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times.	9
John	14	1	Don't let your heart be troubled.  Believe in God. Believe also in me.	9
John	14	2	In my Father's house are many homes.  If it weren't so, I would have told you.  I am going to prepare a place for you.	9
John	14	3	If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.	9
John	14	4	Where I go, you know, and you know the way.	9
John	14	5	Thomas said to him, Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?	9
John	14	6	Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.	9
John	14	7	If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.	9
John	14	8	Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.	9
John	14	9	Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip?  He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, 'Show us the Father?'	9
John	14	10	Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.	9
John	14	11	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake.	9
John	14	12	Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.	9
John	14	13	Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.	9
John	14	14	If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.	9
John	14	15	If you love me, keep my commandments.	9
John	14	16	I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor,{Greek Parakleton:  Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} that he may be with you forever,--	9
John	14	17	the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see him, neither knows him.  You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.	9
John	14	18	I will not leave you orphans.  I will come to you.	9
John	14	19	Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me.  Because I live, you will live also.	9
John	14	20	In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.	9
John	14	21	One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me.  One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.	9
John	14	22	Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?	9
John	14	23	Jesus answered him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.	9
John	14	24	He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words.  The word which you hear isn't mine, but the Father's who sent me.	9
John	14	25	I have said these things to you, while still living with you.	9
John	14	26	But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.	9
John	14	27	Peace I leave with you.  My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you.  Don't let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.	9
John	14	28	You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said 'I am going to my Father;' for the Father is greater than I.	9
John	14	29	Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.	9
John	14	30	I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.	9
John	14	31	But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do.  Arise, let us go from here.	9
John	15	1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.	9
John	15	2	Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.	9
John	15	3	You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.	9
John	15	4	Remain in me, and I in you.  As the branch can't bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.	9
John	15	5	I am the vine.  You are the branches.  He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.	9
John	15	6	If a man doesn't remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.	9
John	15	7	If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.	9
John	15	8	In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.	9
John	15	9	Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.	9
John	15	10	If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain in his love.	9
John	15	11	I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.	9
John	15	12	This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.	9
John	15	13	Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.	9
John	15	14	You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.	9
John	15	15	No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord does.  But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.	9
John	15	16	You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.	9
John	15	17	I command these things to you, that you may love one another.	9
John	15	18	If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.	9
John	15	19	If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.	9
John	15	20	Remember the word that I said to you:  'A servant is not greater than his lord.'{John 13:16} If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.  If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.	9
John	15	21	But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me.	9
John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.	9
John	15	23	He who hates me, hates my Father also.	9
John	15	24	If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin.  But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.	9
John	15	25	But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'{Psalms 35:19; 69:4}	9
John	15	26	When the Counselor{Greek Parakletos:  Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, and Comfortor.} has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.	9
John	15	27	You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.	9
John	16	1	These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble.	9
John	16	2	They will put you out of the synagogues.  Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.	9
John	16	3	They will do these things{TR adds to you} because they have not known the Father, nor me.	9
John	16	4	But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them.  I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.	9
John	16	5	But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'	9
John	16	6	But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.	9
John	16	7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth:  It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.	9
John	16	8	When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;	9
John	16	9	about sin, because they don't believe in me;	9
John	16	10	about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won't see me any more;	9
John	16	11	about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.	9
John	16	12	I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.	9
John	16	13	However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak.  He will declare to you things that are coming.	9
John	16	14	He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.	9
John	16	15	All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes{TR reads will take instead of takes} of mine, and will declare it to you.	9
John	16	16	A little while, and you will not see me.  Again a little while, and you will see me.	9
John	16	17	Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father?'	9
John	16	18	They said therefore, What is this that he says, 'A little while?' We don't know what he is saying.	9
John	16	19	Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?'	9
John	16	20	Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice.  You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.	9
John	16	21	A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn't remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.	9
John	16	22	Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.	9
John	16	23	In that day you will ask me no questions.  Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.	9
John	16	24	Until now, you have asked nothing in my name.  Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.	9
John	16	25	I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.	9
John	16	26	In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,	9
John	16	27	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.	9
John	16	28	I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.	9
John	16	29	His disciples said to him, Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.	9
John	16	30	Now we know that you know all things, and don't need for anyone to question you.  By this we believe that you came forth from God.	9
John	16	31	Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?	9
John	16	32	Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone.  Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.	9
John	16	33	I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.	9
John	17	1	Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the time has come.  Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;	9
John	17	2	even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.	9
John	17	3	This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.	9
John	17	4	I glorified you on the earth.  I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.	9
John	17	5	Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.	9
John	17	6	I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world.  They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.	9
John	17	7	Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,	9
John	17	8	for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.	9
John	17	9	I pray for them.  I don't pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.	9
John	17	10	All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.	9
John	17	11	I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you.  Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.	9
John	17	12	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept.  None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.	9
John	17	13	But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.	9
John	17	14	I have given them your word.  The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.	9
John	17	15	I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.	9
John	17	16	They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.	9
John	17	17	Sanctify them in your truth.  Your word is truth.{Psalm 119:142}	9
John	17	18	As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.	9
John	17	19	For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.	9
John	17	20	Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,	9
John	17	21	that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.	9
John	17	22	The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;	9
John	17	23	I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.	9
John	17	24	Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.	9
John	17	25	Righteous Father, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.	9
John	17	26	I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.	9
John	18	1	When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.	9
John	18	2	Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.	9
John	18	3	Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.	9
John	18	4	Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, Who are you looking for?	9
John	18	5	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.  Jesus said to them, I am he.  Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.	9
John	18	6	When therefore he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.	9
John	18	7	Again therefore he asked them, Who are you looking for? They said, Jesus of Nazareth.	9
John	18	8	Jesus answered, I told you that I am he.  If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,	9
John	18	9	that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.{John 6:39}	9
John	18	10	Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.	9
John	18	11	Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?	9
John	18	12	So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,	9
John	18	13	and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.	9
John	18	14	Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.	9
John	18	15	Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;	9
John	18	16	but Peter was standing at the door outside.  So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.	9
John	18	17	Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you also one of this man's disciples?  He said, I am not.	9
John	18	18	Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold.  They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.	9
John	18	19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.	9
John	18	20	Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world.  I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.	9
John	18	21	Why do you ask me?  Ask those who have heard me what I said to them.  Behold, these know the things which I said.	9
John	18	22	When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest like that?	9
John	18	23	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?	9
John	18	24	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.	9
John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.  They said therefore to him, You aren't also one of his disciples, are you? He denied it, and said, I am not.	9
John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Didn't I see you in the garden with him?	9
John	18	27	Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.	9
John	18	28	They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.	9
John	18	29	Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?	9
John	18	30	They answered him, If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered him up to you.	9
John	18	31	Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.  Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,	9
John	18	32	that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.	9
John	18	33	Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?	9
John	18	34	Jesus answered him, Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?	9
John	18	35	Pilate answered, I'm not a Jew, am I?  Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me.  What have you done?	9
John	18	36	Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.	9
John	18	37	Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king.  For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.	9
John	18	38	Pilate said to him, What is truth?  When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no basis for a charge against him.	9
John	18	39	But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover.  Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?	9
John	18	40	Then they all shouted again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas!  Now Barabbas was a robber.	9
John	19	1	So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him.	9
John	19	2	The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.	9
John	19	3	They kept saying, Hail, King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him.	9
John	19	4	Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.	9
John	19	5	Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.  Pilate said to them, Behold, the man!	9
John	19	6	When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, Crucify!  Crucify!  Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.	9
John	19	7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.	9
John	19	8	When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.	9
John	19	9	He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, Where are you from?  But Jesus gave him no answer.	9
John	19	10	Pilate therefore said to him, Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?	9
John	19	11	Jesus answered, You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above.  Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.	9
John	19	12	At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!	9
John	19	13	When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.	9
John	19	14	Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour.{noon} He said to the Jews, Behold, your King!	9
John	19	15	They cried out, Away with him!  Away with him!  Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King?  The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!	9
John	19	16	So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.	9
John	19	17	He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,	9
John	19	18	where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.	9
John	19	19	Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.	9
John	19	20	Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.	9
John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'	9
John	19	22	Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.	9
John	19	23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.	9
John	19	24	Then they said to one another, Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots.{Psalm 22:18} Therefore the soldiers did these things.	9
John	19	25	But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.	9
John	19	26	Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!	9
John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.	9
John	19	28	After this, Jesus, seeing{NU, TR read knowing instead of seeing} that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I am thirsty.	9
John	19	29	Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.	9
John	19	30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished.  He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.	9
John	19	31	Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.	9
John	19	32	Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;	9
John	19	33	but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.	9
John	19	34	However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.	9
John	19	35	He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.	9
John	19	36	For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be broken.{Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalm 34:20}	9
John	19	37	Again another Scripture says, They will look on him whom they pierced.{Zechariah 12:10}	9
John	19	38	After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body.  Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.	9
John	19	39	Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.{100 Roman pounds of 12 ounces each, or about 72 pounds, or 33 Kilograms.}	9
John	19	40	So they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.	9
John	19	41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.	9
John	19	42	Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.	9
John	20	1	Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.	9
John	20	2	Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid him!	9
John	20	3	Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.	9
John	20	4	They both ran together.  The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.	9
John	20	5	Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in.	9
John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,	9
John	20	7	and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.	9
John	20	8	So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.	9
John	20	9	For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.	9
John	20	10	So the disciples went away again to their own homes.	9
John	20	11	But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping.  So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,	9
John	20	12	and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.	9
John	20	13	They told her, Woman, why are you weeping?  She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have laid him.	9
John	20	14	When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.	9
John	20	15	Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.	9
John	20	16	Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned and said to him, Rhabbouni! which is to say, Teacher!	9
John	20	17	Jesus said to her, Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'	9
John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.	9
John	20	19	When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you.	9
John	20	20	When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.	9
John	20	21	Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.	9
John	20	22	When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit!	9
John	20	23	Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained.	9
John	20	24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.	9
John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord!  But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.	9
John	20	26	After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them.  Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.	9
John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and see my hands.  Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing.	9
John	20	28	Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God!	9
John	20	29	Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me,{TR adds  Thomas,} you have believed.  Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.	9
John	20	30	Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;	9
John	20	31	but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.	9
John	21	1	After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias.  He revealed himself this way.	9
John	21	2	Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.	9
John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them, I'm going fishing. They told him, We are also coming with you. They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.	9
John	21	4	But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.	9
John	21	5	Jesus therefore said to them, Children, have you anything to eat? They answered him, No.	9
John	21	6	He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.  They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.	9
John	21	7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It's the Lord!  So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.	9
John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits{200 cubits is about 100 yards or about 91 meters} away), dragging the net full of fish.	9
John	21	9	So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.	9
John	21	10	Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.	9
John	21	11	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.	9
John	21	12	Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast. None of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.	9
John	21	13	Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.	9
John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.	9
John	21	15	So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.	9
John	21	16	He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?  He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.  He said to him, Tend my sheep.	9
John	21	17	He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?  Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, Do you have affection for me? He said to him, Lord, you know everything.  You know that I have affection for you.  Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.	9
John	21	18	Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to.  But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go.	9
John	21	19	Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.  When he had said this, he said to him, Follow me.	9
John	21	20	Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, Lord, who is going to betray You?	9
John	21	21	Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?	9
John	21	22	Jesus said to him, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?  You follow me.	9
John	21	23	This saying therefore went out among the brothers{The word for brothers here may be also correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?	9
John	21	24	This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things.  We know that his witness is true.	9
Psalms	42	17	So Job died, being old and full of days.	10
Psalms	1	1	Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;	10
Psalms	1	2	but his delight is in Yahweh's law.  On his law he meditates day and night.	10
Psalms	1	3	He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.	10
Psalms	1	4	The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.	10
Psalms	1	5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.	10
Psalms	1	6	For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.	10
Psalms	2	1	Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?	10
Psalms	2	2	The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,{The word Anointed is the same as the word for Messiah or Christ} saying,	10
Psalms	2	3	Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us.	10
Psalms	2	4	He who sits in the heavens will laugh.  The Lord will have them in derision.	10
Psalms	2	5	Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:	10
Psalms	2	6	Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion.	10
Psalms	2	7	I will tell of the decree.  Yahweh said to me, You are my son. Today I have become your father.	10
Psalms	2	8	Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.	10
Psalms	2	9	You shall break them with a rod of iron.  You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.	10
Psalms	2	10	Now therefore be wise, you kings.  Be instructed, you judges of the earth.	10
Psalms	2	11	Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.	10
Psalms	2	12	Give sincere homage{or, Kiss the son}, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.	10

Psalms	3	3	But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.	10
Psalms	3	4	I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill.  Selah.	10

Psalms	3	6	I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.	10

Psalms	5	2	Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you do I pray.	10
Psalms	5	3	Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice.  In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.	10

Psalms	5	5	The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.  You hate all workers of iniquity.	10

Psalms	5	8	Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.	10
Psalms	5	9	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction.  Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.	10
Psalms	5	10	Hold them guilty, God.  Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.	10

Psalms	7	1	<<A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.>> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,	10
Psalms	7	2	lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.	10
Psalms	7	3	Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,	10
Psalms	7	4	if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),	10
Psalms	7	5	let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.  Selah.	10

Psalms	7	9	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.	10
Psalms	7	10	My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.	10
Psalms	7	11	God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.	10
Psalms	7	12	If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.	10
Psalms	7	13	He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.	10

Psalms	73	2	But as for me, my feet were almost gone.  My steps had nearly slipped.	10
Psalms	73	3	For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.	10
Psalms	73	4	For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.	10
Psalms	73	5	They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.	10

Psalms	73	7	Their eyes bulge with fat.  Their minds pass the limits of conceit.	10
Psalms	73	8	They scoff and speak with malice.  In arrogance, they threaten oppression.	10
Psalms	73	9	They have set their mouth in the heavens.  Their tongue walks through the earth.	10

Psalms	73	13	Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,	10
Psalms	73	14	For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.	10
Psalms	73	15	If I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.	10
Psalms	73	16	When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;	10
Psalms	73	17	Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.	10
Psalms	73	18	Surely you set them in slippery places.  You throw them down to destruction.	10
Psalms	73	19	How they are suddenly destroyed!  They are completely swept away with terrors.	10
Psalms	73	20	As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.	10
Psalms	73	21	For my soul was grieved.  I was embittered in my heart.	10
Psalms	73	22	I was so senseless and ignorant.  I was a brute beast before you.	10
Psalms	73	23	Nevertheless, I am continually with you.  You have held my right hand.	10
Psalms	73	24	You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.	10
Psalms	73	25	Who do I have in heaven?  There is no one on earth who I desire besides you.	10
Psalms	73	26	My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.	10
Psalms	73	27	For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.	10

Psalms	74	1	<<A contemplation by Asaph.>> God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?	10
Psalms	74	2	Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; Mount Zion, in which you have lived.	10
Psalms	74	3	Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.	10
Psalms	74	4	Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.	10
Psalms	74	5	They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.	10
Psalms	74	6	Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.	10
Psalms	74	7	They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.	10
Psalms	74	8	They said in their heart, We will crush them completely. They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.	10
Psalms	74	9	We see no miraculous signs.  There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.	10
Psalms	74	10	How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?  Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?	10
Psalms	74	11	Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!	10
Psalms	74	12	Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.	10
Psalms	74	13	You divided the sea by your strength.  You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.	10
Psalms	74	14	You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.  You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.	10
Psalms	74	15	You opened up spring and stream.  You dried up mighty rivers.	10
Psalms	74	16	The day is yours, the night is also yours.  You have prepared the light and the sun.	10
Psalms	74	17	You have set all the boundaries of the earth.  You have made summer and winter.	10
Psalms	74	18	Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.	10
Psalms	74	19	Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don't forget the life of your poor forever.	10
Psalms	74	20	Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.	10
Psalms	74	21	Don't let the oppressed return ashamed.  Let the poor and needy praise your name.	10
Psalms	74	22	Arise, God!  Plead your own cause.  Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.	10
Psalms	74	23	Don't forget the voice of your adversaries.  The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.	10
Psalms	75	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of Do Not Destroy. A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near.  Men tell about your wondrous works.	10

Psalms	75	3	The earth and all its inhabitants quake.  I firmly hold its pillars.  Selah.	10
Psalms	75	4	I said to the arrogant, Don't boast!  I said to the wicked, Don't lift up the horn.	10
Psalms	75	5	Don't lift up your horn on high.  Don't speak with a stiff neck.	10
Psalms	75	6	For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.	10
Psalms	75	7	But God is the judge.  He puts down one, and lifts up another.	10
Psalms	75	8	For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices.  He pours it out.  Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.	10
Psalms	75	9	But I will declare this forever:  I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.	10
Psalms	75	10	I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.	10
Psalms	76	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> In Judah, God is known. His name is great in Israel.	10
Psalms	76	2	His tent is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.	10
Psalms	76	3	There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war.  Selah.	10
Psalms	76	4	Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.	10
Psalms	76	5	Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.	10
Psalms	76	6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.	10
Psalms	76	7	You, even you, are to be feared.  Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?	10
Psalms	76	8	You pronounced judgment from heaven.  The earth feared, and was silent,	10
Psalms	76	9	when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth.  Selah.	10
Psalms	76	10	Surely the wrath of man praises you.  The survivors of your wrath are restrained.	10
Psalms	76	11	Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!  Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.	10
Psalms	76	12	He will cut off the spirit of princes.  He is feared by the kings of the earth.	10
Psalms	77	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthun.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> My cry goes to God!  Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.	10
Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.  My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.	10
Psalms	77	3	I remember God, and I groan.  I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.  Selah.	10
Psalms	77	4	You hold my eyelids open.  I am so troubled that I can't speak.	10
Psalms	77	5	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.	10
Psalms	77	6	I remember my song in the night.  I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:	10
Psalms	77	7	Will the Lord reject us forever?  Will he be favorable no more?	10
Psalms	77	8	Has his loving kindness vanished forever?  Does his promise fail for generations?	10
Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?  Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?  Selah.	10
Psalms	77	10	Then I thought, I will appeal to this:  the years of the right hand of the Most High.	10
Psalms	77	11	I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.	10
Psalms	77	12	I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.	10
Psalms	77	13	Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.  What god is great like God?	10
Psalms	77	14	You are the God who does wonders.  You have made your strength known among the peoples.	10
Psalms	77	15	You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.  Selah.	10
Psalms	77	16	The waters saw you, God.  The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.	10
Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured out water.  The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.	10
Psalms	77	18	The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.  The lightnings lit up the world.  The earth trembled and shook.	10
Psalms	77	19	Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.	10
Psalms	77	20	You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.	10
Psalms	78	1	<<A contemplation by Asaph.>> Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.	10
Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark sayings of old,	10
Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.	10
Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.	10
Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;	10
Psalms	78	6	that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,	10
Psalms	78	7	that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,	10
Psalms	78	8	and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.	10
Psalms	78	9	The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.	10
Psalms	78	10	They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.	10
Psalms	78	11	They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.	10
Psalms	78	12	He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.	10
Psalms	78	13	He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.	10
Psalms	78	14	In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.	10
Psalms	78	15	He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.	10
Psalms	78	16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.	10
Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.	10
Psalms	78	18	They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.	10
Psalms	78	19	Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?	10
Psalms	78	20	Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?	10
Psalms	78	21	Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,	10
Psalms	78	22	because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in his salvation.	10
Psalms	78	23	Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.	10
Psalms	78	24	He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.	10
Psalms	78	25	Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.	10
Psalms	78	26	He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power he guided the south wind.	10
Psalms	78	27	He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.	10
Psalms	78	28	He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.	10
Psalms	78	29	So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.	10
Psalms	78	30	They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet in their mouths,	10
Psalms	78	31	when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.	10
Psalms	78	32	For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in his wondrous works.	10
Psalms	78	33	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.	10
Psalms	78	34	When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.	10
Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.	10
Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.	10
Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.	10
Psalms	78	38	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up all his wrath.	10
Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.	10
Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!	10
Psalms	78	41	They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.	10
Psalms	78	42	They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;	10
Psalms	78	43	how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,	10
Psalms	78	44	he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.	10
Psalms	78	45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.	10
Psalms	78	46	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.	10
Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.	10
Psalms	78	48	He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.	10
Psalms	78	49	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.	10
Psalms	78	50	He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,	10
Psalms	78	51	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.	10
Psalms	78	52	But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.	10
Psalms	78	53	He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.	10
Psalms	78	54	He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.	10
Psalms	78	55	He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.	10
Psalms	78	56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep his testimonies;	10
Psalms	78	57	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.	10
Psalms	78	58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.	10
Psalms	78	59	When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;	10
Psalms	78	60	So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;	10
Psalms	78	61	and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary's hand.	10
Psalms	78	62	He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.	10
Psalms	78	63	Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.	10
Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.	10
Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.	10
Psalms	78	66	He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to a perpetual reproach.	10
Psalms	78	67	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,	10
Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.	10
Psalms	78	69	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.	10
Psalms	78	70	He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;	10
Psalms	78	71	from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.	10
Psalms	78	72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.	10
Psalms	79	1	<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.	10
Psalms	79	2	They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.	10
Psalms	79	3	Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.	10
Psalms	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.	10
Psalms	79	5	How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy burn like fire?	10
Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;	10
Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.	10
Psalms	79	8	Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.	10
Psalms	79	9	Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.	10
Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say, Where is their God?  Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out.	10
Psalms	79	11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.	10
Psalms	79	12	Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.	10
Psalms	79	13	So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.	10
Psalms	80	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of The Lilies of the Covenant.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.	10

Psalms	80	4	Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?	10
Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.	10
Psalms	80	6	You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.	10
Psalms	80	7	Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.	10
Psalms	80	8	You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations, and planted it.	10
Psalms	80	9	You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root, and filled the land.	10
Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were like God's cedars.	10
Psalms	80	11	It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.	10
Psalms	80	12	Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?	10
Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals of the field feed on it.	10
Psalms	80	14	Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,	10
Psalms	80	15	the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.	10
Psalms	80	16	It's burned with fire.  It's cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.	10
Psalms	80	17	Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.	10
Psalms	80	18	So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call on your name.	10
Psalms	80	19	Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.	10
Psalms	81	1	<<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength!  Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!	10
Psalms	81	2	Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.	10
Psalms	81	3	Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.	10
Psalms	81	4	For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.	10
Psalms	81	5	He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.	10
Psalms	81	6	I removed his shoulder from the burden.  His hands were freed from the basket.	10
Psalms	81	7	You called in trouble, and I delivered you.  I answered you in the secret place of thunder.  I tested you at the waters of Meribah.  Selah.	10
Psalms	81	8	Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me!	10
Psalms	81	9	There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god.	10
Psalms	81	10	I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.	10
Psalms	81	11	But my people didn't listen to my voice.  Israel desired none of me.	10
Psalms	81	12	So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.	10
Psalms	81	13	Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!	10
Psalms	81	14	I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.	10
Psalms	81	15	The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.	10
Psalms	81	16	But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.	10
Psalms	82	1	<<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.	10

Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.	10

Psalms	82	6	I said, You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.	10
Psalms	82	7	Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.	10

Psalms	83	1	<<A song.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent. Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.	10

Psalms	83	3	They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.	10
Psalms	83	4	Come, they say, and let's destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.	10
Psalms	83	5	For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.	10
Psalms	83	6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;	10
Psalms	83	7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;	10
Psalms	83	8	Assyria also is joined with them.  They have helped the children of Lot.  Selah.	10
Psalms	83	9	Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;	10
Psalms	83	10	who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.	10
Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;	10
Psalms	83	12	who said, Let us take possession of God's pasturelands.	10
Psalms	83	13	My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.	10
Psalms	83	14	As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,	10
Psalms	83	15	so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.	10
Psalms	83	16	Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh.	10
Psalms	83	17	Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.  Yes, let them be confounded and perish;	10
Psalms	83	18	that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.	10

Psalms	88	14	Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?  Why do you hide your face from me?	10
Psalms	88	15	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.	10
Psalms	88	16	Your fierce wrath has gone over me.  Your terrors have cut me off.	10
Psalms	88	17	They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.	10

Psalms	89	23	I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike those who hate him.	10

Psalms	89	25	I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.	10
Psalms	89	26	He will call to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation!'	10

Psalms	89	28	I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore. My covenant will stand firm with him.	10
Psalms	89	29	I will also make his seed endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.	10
Psalms	89	30	If his children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances;	10
Psalms	89	31	if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments;	10
Psalms	89	32	then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.	10
Psalms	89	33	But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.	10
Psalms	89	34	I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.	10
Psalms	89	35	Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David.	10
Psalms	89	36	His seed will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.	10
Psalms	89	37	It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.  Selah.	10
Psalms	89	38	But you have rejected and spurned.  You have been angry with your anointed.	10
Psalms	89	39	You have renounced the covenant of your servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust.	10
Psalms	89	40	You have broken down all his hedges.  You have brought his strongholds to ruin.	10
Psalms	89	41	All who pass by the way rob him.  He has become a reproach to his neighbors.	10
Psalms	89	42	You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice.	10
Psalms	89	43	Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven't supported him in battle.	10
Psalms	89	44	You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down to the ground.	10
Psalms	89	45	You have shortened the days of his youth.  You have covered him with shame.  Selah.	10
Psalms	89	46	How long, Yahweh?  Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?	10
Psalms	89	47	Remember how short my time is!  For what vanity have you created all the children of men!	10

Psalms	90	4	For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night.	10
Psalms	90	5	You sweep them away as they sleep.  In the morning they sprout like new grass.	10

Psalms	90	7	For we are consumed in your anger.  We are troubled in your wrath.	10
Psalms	90	8	You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.	10
Psalms	90	9	For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.	10
Psalms	90	10	The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.	10
Psalms	90	11	Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?	10
Psalms	90	12	So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.	10
Psalms	90	13	Relent, Yahweh!  How long?  Have compassion on your servants!	10
Psalms	90	14	Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.	10

Psalms	105	37	He brought them forth with silver and gold.  There was not one feeble person among his tribes.	10
Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.	10
Psalms	105	39	He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.	10
Psalms	105	40	They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.	10
Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.  They ran as a river in the dry places.	10
Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.	10
Psalms	105	43	He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.	10
Psalms	105	44	He gave them the lands of the nations.  They took the labor of the peoples in possession,	10

Psalms	106	6	We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.	10
Psalms	106	7	Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.	10
Psalms	106	8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power known.	10
Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.	10
Psalms	106	10	He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.	10
Psalms	106	11	The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one of them left.	10
Psalms	106	12	Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.	10
Psalms	106	13	They soon forgot his works.  They didn't wait for his counsel,	10
Psalms	106	14	but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.	10
Psalms	106	15	He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.	10
Psalms	106	16	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.	10
Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.	10
Psalms	106	18	A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned up the wicked.	10
Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.	10
Psalms	106	20	Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.	10
Psalms	106	21	They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,	10
Psalms	106	22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.	10
Psalms	106	23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.	10
Psalms	106	24	Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,	10
Psalms	106	25	but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.	10
Psalms	106	26	Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,	10
Psalms	106	27	that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.	10
Psalms	106	28	They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.	10
Psalms	106	29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.	10
Psalms	106	30	Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.	10
Psalms	106	31	That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.	10
Psalms	106	32	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;	10
Psalms	106	33	because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.	10
Psalms	106	34	They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,	10
Psalms	106	35	but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.	10
Psalms	106	36	They served their idols, which became a snare to them.	10
Psalms	106	37	Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.	10
Psalms	106	38	They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.	10
Psalms	106	39	Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.	10
Psalms	106	40	Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.	10
Psalms	106	41	He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated them ruled over them.	10
Psalms	106	42	Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into subjection under their hand.	10
Psalms	106	43	Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.	10
Psalms	106	44	Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.	10
Psalms	106	45	He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.	10
Psalms	106	46	He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.	10
Psalms	106	47	Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!	10

Psalms	107	3	And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.	10
Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.	10
Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.	10

Psalms	107	7	he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.	10
Psalms	107	8	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!	10
Psalms	107	9	For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry soul with good.	10
Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,	10
Psalms	107	11	because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High.	10
Psalms	107	12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.	10
Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.	10
Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds in sunder.	10
Psalms	107	15	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!	10
Psalms	107	16	For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.	10
Psalms	107	17	Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities.	10
Psalms	107	18	Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to the gates of death.	10

Psalms	107	20	He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.	10
Psalms	107	21	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works to the children of men!	10
Psalms	107	22	Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing.	10
Psalms	107	23	Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;	10
Psalms	107	24	These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.	10
Psalms	107	25	For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.	10
Psalms	107	26	They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.	10
Psalms	107	27	They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.	10
Psalms	107	28	Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.	10
Psalms	107	29	He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.	10
Psalms	107	30	Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their desired haven.	10
Psalms	107	31	Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful works for the children of men!	10
Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.	10
Psalms	107	33	He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,	10
Psalms	107	34	and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.	10
Psalms	107	35	He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.	10
Psalms	107	36	There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,	10
Psalms	107	37	sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.	10
Psalms	107	38	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.	10
Psalms	107	39	Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.	10
Psalms	107	40	He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.	10
Psalms	107	41	Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.	10
Psalms	107	42	The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will shut their mouths.	10

Psalms	109	15	Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;	10
Psalms	109	16	because he didn't remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.	10
Psalms	109	17	Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.  He didn't delight in blessing, and it was far from him.	10

Romans	28	31	preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.	11
Romans	1	1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,	11
Romans	1	2	which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,	11
Romans	1	3	concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,	11
Romans	1	4	who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,	11
Romans	1	5	through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;	11
Romans	1	6	among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;	11
Romans	1	7	to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	11
Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.	11
Romans	1	9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,	11
Romans	1	10	requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.	11
Romans	1	11	For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;	11
Romans	1	12	that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.	11
Romans	1	13	Now I don't desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.	11
Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.	11
Romans	1	15	So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.	11
Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.	11
Romans	1	17	For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}	11
Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,	11
Romans	1	19	because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.	11
Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.	11
Romans	1	21	Because, knowing God, they didn't glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.	11
Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,	11
Romans	1	23	and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.	11
Romans	1	24	Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,	11
Romans	1	25	who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.  Amen.	11
Romans	1	26	For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.	11
Romans	1	27	Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.	11
Romans	1	28	Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;	11
Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,	11
Romans	1	30	backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,	11
Romans	1	31	without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;	11
Romans	1	32	who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.	11
Romans	2	1	Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.	11
Romans	2	2	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.	11
Romans	2	3	Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?	11
Romans	2	4	Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?	11
Romans	2	5	But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;	11
Romans	2	6	who will pay back to everyone according to their works:{Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12}	11
Romans	2	7	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;	11
Romans	2	8	but to those who are self-seeking, and don't obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,	11
Romans	2	9	oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	11
Romans	2	10	But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	11
Romans	2	11	For there is no partiality with God.	11
Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law.  As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.	11
Romans	2	13	For it isn't the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified	11
Romans	2	14	(for when Gentiles who don't have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,	11
Romans	2	15	in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)	11
Romans	2	16	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.	11
Romans	2	17	Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,	11
Romans	2	18	and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,	11
Romans	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,	11
Romans	2	20	a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.	11
Romans	2	21	You therefore who teach another, don't you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn't steal, do you steal?	11
Romans	2	22	You who say a man shouldn't commit adultery.  Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?	11
Romans	2	23	You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?	11
Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,{Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22} just as it is written.	11
Romans	2	25	For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.	11
Romans	2	26	If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?	11
Romans	2	27	Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?	11
Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;	11
Romans	2	29	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.	11
Romans	3	1	Then what advantage does the Jew have?  Or what is the profit of circumcision?	11
Romans	3	2	Much in every way!  Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.	11
Romans	3	3	For what if some were without faith?  Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?	11
Romans	3	4	May it never be!  Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment.{Psalm 51:4}	11
Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say?  Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.	11
Romans	3	6	May it never be!  For then how will God judge the world?	11
Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?	11
Romans	3	8	Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Those who say so are justly condemned.	11
Romans	3	9	What then?  Are we better than they?  No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.	11
Romans	3	10	As it is written, There is no one righteous; no, not one.	11
Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands.  There is no one who seeks after God.	11
Romans	3	12	They have all turned aside.  They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one.{Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Ecclesiastes 7:20}	11
Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open tomb.  With their tongues they have used deceit.{Psalm 5:9} The poison of vipers is under their lips;{Psalm 140:3}	11
Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.{Psalm 10:7}	11
Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood.	11
Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways.	11
Romans	3	17	The way of peace, they haven't known.{Isaiah 59:7-8}	11
Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.{Psalm 36:1}	11
Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.	11
Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight.  For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.	11
Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;	11
Romans	3	22	even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe.  For there is no distinction,	11
Romans	3	23	for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;	11
Romans	3	24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;	11
Romans	3	25	whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice{or, a propitiation}, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;	11
Romans	3	26	to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.	11
Romans	3	27	Where then is the boasting?  It is excluded.  By what manner of law? Of works?  No, but by a law of faith.	11
Romans	3	28	We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.	11
Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only?  Isn't he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,	11
Romans	3	30	since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.	11
Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify the law through faith?  May it never be! No, we establish the law.	11
Romans	4	1	What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?	11
Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.	11
Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say?  Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}	11
Romans	4	4	Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt.	11
Romans	4	5	But to him who doesn't work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.	11
Romans	4	6	Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,	11
Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.	11
Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.{Psalm 32:1-2}	11
Romans	4	9	Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also?  For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.	11
Romans	4	10	How then was it counted?  When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?  Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	11
Romans	4	11	He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.	11
Romans	4	12	The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.	11
Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn't through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.	11
Romans	4	14	For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.	11
Romans	4	15	For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.	11
Romans	4	16	For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.	11
Romans	4	17	As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations.{Genesis 17:5} This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.	11
Romans	4	18	Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So will your seed be.{Genesis 15:5}	11
Romans	4	19	Without being weakened in faith, he didn't consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.	11
Romans	4	20	Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn't waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,	11
Romans	4	21	and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.	11
Romans	4	22	Therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness.{Genesis 15:6}	11
Romans	4	23	Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,	11
Romans	4	24	but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,	11
Romans	4	25	who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.	11
Romans	5	1	Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;	11
Romans	5	2	through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand.  We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.	11
Romans	5	3	Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;	11
Romans	5	4	and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:	11
Romans	5	5	and hope doesn't disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.	11
Romans	5	6	For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.	11
Romans	5	7	For one will hardly die for a righteous man.  Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.	11
Romans	5	8	But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	11
Romans	5	9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him.	11
Romans	5	10	For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.	11
Romans	5	11	Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.	11
Romans	5	12	Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.	11
Romans	5	13	For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.	11
Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.	11
Romans	5	15	But the free gift isn't like the trespass.  For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.	11
Romans	5	16	The gift is not as through one who sinned:  for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.	11
Romans	5	17	For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.	11
Romans	5	18	So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.	11
Romans	5	19	For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.	11
Romans	5	20	The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;	11
Romans	5	21	that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	11
Romans	6	1	What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	11
Romans	6	2	May it never be!  We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?	11
Romans	6	3	Or don't you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?	11
Romans	6	4	We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.	11
Romans	6	5	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;	11
Romans	6	6	knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.	11
Romans	6	7	For he who has died has been freed from sin.	11
Romans	6	8	But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;	11
Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!	11
Romans	6	10	For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.	11
Romans	6	11	Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.	11
Romans	6	12	Therefore don't let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.	11
Romans	6	13	Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.	11
Romans	6	14	For sin will not have dominion over you.  For you are not under law, but under grace.	11
Romans	6	15	What then?  Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace?  May it never be!	11
Romans	6	16	Don't you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?	11
Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.	11
Romans	6	18	Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.	11
Romans	6	19	I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.	11
Romans	6	20	For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.	11
Romans	6	21	What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed?  For the end of those things is death.	11
Romans	6	22	But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.	11
Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.	11
Romans	7	1	Or don't you know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?	11
Romans	7	2	For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.	11
Romans	7	3	So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress.  But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.	11
Romans	7	4	Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.	11
Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.	11
Romans	7	6	But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.	11
Romans	7	7	What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  May it never be! However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said, You shall not covet.{Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21}	11
Romans	7	8	But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting.  For apart from the law, sin is dead.	11
Romans	7	9	I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.	11
Romans	7	10	The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;	11
Romans	7	11	for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.	11
Romans	7	12	Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.	11
Romans	7	13	Did then that which is good become death to me?  May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.	11
Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.	11
Romans	7	15	For I don't know what I am doing.  For I don't practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.	11
Romans	7	16	But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.	11
Romans	7	17	So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.	11
Romans	7	18	For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing that which is good.	11
Romans	7	19	For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I don't desire, that I practice.	11
Romans	7	20	But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.	11
Romans	7	21	I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.	11
Romans	7	22	For I delight in God's law after the inward man,	11
Romans	7	23	but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.	11
Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am!  Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?	11
Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!  So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.	11
Romans	8	1	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.{NU omits who don't walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit}	11
Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.	11
Romans	8	3	For what the law couldn't do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;	11
Romans	8	4	that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	11
Romans	8	5	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.	11
Romans	8	6	For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;	11
Romans	8	7	because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be.	11
Romans	8	8	Those who are in the flesh can't please God.	11
Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you.  But if any man doesn't have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.	11
Romans	8	10	If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.	11
Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.	11
Romans	8	12	So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.	11
Romans	8	13	For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.	11
Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.	11
Romans	8	15	For you didn't receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba{Abba is an Aramaic word for father or daddy, often used affectionately and respectfully in prayer to our Father in heaven.}!  Father!	11
Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;	11
Romans	8	17	and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.	11
Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.	11
Romans	8	19	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.	11
Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope	11
Romans	8	21	that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.	11
Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.	11
Romans	8	23	Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.	11
Romans	8	24	For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?	11
Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for it with patience.	11
Romans	8	26	In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don't know how to pray as we ought.  But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.	11
Romans	8	27	He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.	11
Romans	8	28	We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.	11
Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}	11
Romans	8	30	Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified.  Whom he justified, those he also glorified.	11
Romans	8	31	What then shall we say about these things?  If God is for us, who can be against us?	11
Romans	8	32	He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?	11
Romans	8	33	Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.	11
Romans	8	34	Who is he who condemns?  It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.	11
Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	11
Romans	8	36	Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.{Psalm 44:22}	11
Romans	8	37	No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.	11
Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,	11
Romans	8	39	nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	11
Romans	9	1	I tell the truth in Christ.  I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,	11
Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.	11
Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,	11
Romans	9	4	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;	11
Romans	9	5	of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever.  Amen.	11
Romans	9	6	But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.	11
Romans	9	7	Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, In Isaac will your seed be called.{Genesis 21:12}	11
Romans	9	8	That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.	11
Romans	9	9	For this is a word of promise, At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.{Genesis 18:10,14}	11
Romans	9	10	Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.	11
Romans	9	11	For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,	11
Romans	9	12	it was said to her, The elder will serve the younger.{Genesis 25:23}	11
Romans	9	13	Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.{Malachi 1:2-3}	11
Romans	9	14	What shall we say then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  May it never be!	11
Romans	9	15	For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.{Exodus 33:19}	11
Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.	11
Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.{Exodus 9:16}	11
Romans	9	18	So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.	11
Romans	9	19	You will say then to me, Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?	11
Romans	9	20	But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God?  Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, Why did you make me like this?{Isaiah 29:16; 45:9}	11
Romans	9	21	Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?	11
Romans	9	22	What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,	11
Romans	9	23	and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,	11
Romans	9	24	us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?	11
Romans	9	25	As he says also in Hosea, I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people; and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved.{Hosea 2:23}	11
Romans	9	26	It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' There they will be called 'children of the living God.'{Hosea 1:10}	11
Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;	11
Romans	9	28	for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.{Isaiah 10:22-23}	11
Romans	9	29	As Isaiah has said before, Unless the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)} had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.{Isaiah 1:9}	11
Romans	9	30	What shall we say then?  That the Gentiles, who didn't follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;	11
Romans	9	31	but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive at the law of righteousness.	11
Romans	9	32	Why?  Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law.  They stumbled over the stumbling stone;	11
Romans	9	33	even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.{Isaiah 8:14; 28:16}	11
Romans	10	1	Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.	11
Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.	11
Romans	10	3	For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn't subject themselves to the righteousness of God.	11
Romans	10	4	For Christ is the fulfillment{or, completion, or end} of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.	11
Romans	10	5	For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, The one who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}	11
Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith says this, Don't say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'{Deuteronomy 30:12} (that is, to bring Christ down);	11
Romans	10	7	or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'{Deuteronomy 30:13} (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)	11
Romans	10	8	But what does it say?  The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;{Deuteronomy 30:14} that is, the word of faith, which we preach:	11
Romans	10	9	that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.	11
Romans	10	10	For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	11
Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says, Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.{Isaiah 28:16}	11
Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.	11
Romans	10	13	For, Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.{Joel 2:32}	11
Romans	10	14	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?	11
Romans	10	15	And how will they preach unless they are sent?  As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!{Isaiah 52:7}	11
Romans	10	16	But they didn't all listen to the glad news.  For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?{Isaiah 53:1}	11
Romans	10	17	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	11
Romans	10	18	But I say, didn't they hear?  Yes, most certainly, Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.{Psalm 19:4}	11
Romans	10	19	But I ask, didn't Israel know?  First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.{Deuteronomy 32:31}	11
Romans	10	20	Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found by those who didn't seek me.  I was revealed to those who didn't ask for me.{Isaiah 65:1}	11
Romans	10	21	But as to Israel he says, All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.{Isaiah 65:2}	11
Romans	11	1	I ask then, did God reject his people?  May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.	11
Romans	11	2	God didn't reject his people, which he foreknew.  Or don't you know what the Scripture says about Elijah?  How he pleads with God against Israel:	11
Romans	11	3	Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.{1 Kings 19:10,14}	11
Romans	11	4	But how does God answer him?  I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.{1 Kings 19:18}	11
Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.	11
Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.  But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.	11
Romans	11	7	What then?  That which Israel seeks for, that he didn't obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.	11
Romans	11	8	According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.{Deuteronomy 29:4; Isaiah 29:10}	11
Romans	11	9	David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.	11
Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always.{Psalm 69:22,23}	11
Romans	11	11	I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?  May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.	11
Romans	11	12	Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?	11
Romans	11	13	For I speak to you who are Gentiles.  Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;	11
Romans	11	14	if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.	11
Romans	11	15	For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?	11
Romans	11	16	If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump.  If the root is holy, so are the branches.	11
Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;	11
Romans	11	18	don't boast over the branches.  But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.	11
Romans	11	19	You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.	11
Romans	11	20	True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith.  Don't be conceited, but fear;	11
Romans	11	21	for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.	11
Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and severity of God.  Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.	11
Romans	11	23	They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.	11
Romans	11	24	For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?	11
Romans	11	25	For I don't desire you to be ignorant, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,	11
Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved.  Even as it is written, There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.	11
Romans	11	27	This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins.{Isaiah 59:20-21; 27:9; Jeremiah 31:33-34}	11
Romans	11	28	Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.	11
Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.	11
Romans	11	30	For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,	11
Romans	11	31	even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.	11
Romans	11	32	For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.	11
Romans	11	33	Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!  How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!	11
Romans	11	34	For who has known the mind of the Lord?  Or who has been his counselor?{Isaiah 40:13}	11
Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?{Job 41:11}	11
Romans	11	36	For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever!  Amen.	11
Romans	12	1	Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.	11
Romans	12	2	Don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.	11
Romans	12	3	For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.	11
Romans	12	4	For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don't have the same function,	11
Romans	12	5	so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.	11
Romans	12	6	Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;	11
Romans	12	7	or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;	11
Romans	12	8	or he who exhorts, to his exhorting:  he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.	11
Romans	12	9	Let love be without hypocrisy.  Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.	11
Romans	12	10	In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;	11
Romans	12	11	not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;	11
Romans	12	12	rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;	11
Romans	12	13	contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.	11
Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don't curse.	11
Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice.  Weep with those who weep.	11
Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another.  Don't set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don't be wise in your own conceits.	11
Romans	12	17	Repay no one evil for evil.  Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.	11
Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.	11
Romans	12	19	Don't seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath.  For it is written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.{Deuteronomy 32:35}	11
Romans	12	20	Therefore If your enemy is hungry, feed him.  If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.{Proverbs 25:21-22}	11
Romans	12	21	Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.	11
Romans	13	1	Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.	11
Romans	13	2	Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment.	11
Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,	11
Romans	13	4	for he is a servant of God to you for good.  But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn't bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil.	11
Romans	13	5	Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake.	11
Romans	13	6	For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.	11
Romans	13	7	Give therefore to everyone what you owe:  taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor.	11
Romans	13	8	Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.	11
Romans	13	9	For the commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not give false testimony, You shall not covet,{TR adds You shall not give false testimony,}{Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deuteronomy 5:17-19,21} and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}	11
Romans	13	10	Love doesn't harm a neighbor.  Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.	11
Romans	13	11	Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed.	11
Romans	13	12	The night is far gone, and the day is near.  Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.	11
Romans	13	13	Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy.	11
Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.	11
Romans	14	1	Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.	11
Romans	14	2	One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.	11
Romans	14	3	Don't let him who eats despise him who doesn't eat. Don't let him who doesn't eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.	11
Romans	14	4	Who are you who judge another's servant?  To his own lord he stands or falls.  Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.	11
Romans	14	5	One man esteems one day as more important.  Another esteems every day alike.  Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.	11
Romans	14	6	He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn't eat, to the Lord he doesn't eat, and gives God thanks.	11
Romans	14	7	For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.	11
Romans	14	8	For if we live, we live to the Lord.  Or if we die, we die to the Lord.  If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.	11
Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.	11
Romans	14	10	But you, why do you judge your brother?  Or you again, why do you despise your brother?  For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.	11
Romans	14	11	For it is written, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'to me every knee will bow.  Every tongue will confess to God.'{Isaiah 45:23}	11
Romans	14	12	So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.	11
Romans	14	13	Therefore let's not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling.	11
Romans	14	14	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.	11
Romans	14	15	Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love.  Don't destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.	11
Romans	14	16	Then don't let your good be slandered,	11
Romans	14	17	for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.	11
Romans	14	18	For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.	11
Romans	14	19	So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up.	11
Romans	14	20	Don't overthrow God's work for food's sake.  All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating.	11
Romans	14	21	It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak.	11
Romans	14	22	Do you have faith?  Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who doesn't judge himself in that which he approves.	11
Romans	14	23	But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn't of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. (14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.{TR places verses 24-26 after Romans 16:24 as verses 25-27.}	11
Romans	15	1	Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves.	11
Romans	15	2	Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up.	11
Romans	15	3	For even Christ didn't please himself.  But, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.{Psalm 69:9}	11
Romans	15	4	For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.	11
Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,	11
Romans	15	6	that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	11
Romans	15	7	Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,{TR reads us instead of you} to the glory of God.	11
Romans	15	8	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,	11
Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.{2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 18:49}	11
Romans	15	10	Again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.{Deuteronomy 32:43}	11
Romans	15	11	Again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!  Let all the peoples praise him.{Psalm 117:1}	11
Romans	15	12	Again, Isaiah says, There will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope.{Isaiah 11:10}	11
Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.	11
Romans	15	14	I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.}, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.	11
Romans	15	15	But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,	11
Romans	15	16	that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.	11
Romans	15	17	I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.	11
Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,	11
Romans	15	19	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God's Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;	11
Romans	15	20	yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation.	11
Romans	15	21	But, as it is written, They will see, to whom no news of him came. They who haven't heard will understand.{Isaiah 52:15}	11
Romans	15	22	Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,	11
Romans	15	23	but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,	11
Romans	15	24	whenever I journey to Spain, I will come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.	11
Romans	15	25	But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.	11
Romans	15	26	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.	11
Romans	15	27	Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.	11
Romans	15	28	When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.	11
Romans	15	29	I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.	11
Romans	15	30	Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,	11
Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;	11
Romans	15	32	that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.	11
Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all.  Amen.	11
Romans	16	1	I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant{or, deacon} of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,	11
Romans	16	2	that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.	11
Romans	16	3	Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,	11
Romans	16	4	who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles.	11
Romans	16	5	Greet the assembly that is in their house.  Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.	11
Romans	16	6	Greet Mary, who labored much for us.	11
Romans	16	7	Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.	11
Romans	16	8	Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.	11
Romans	16	9	Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.	11
Romans	16	10	Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ.  Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.	11
Romans	16	11	Greet Herodion, my kinsman.  Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.	11
Romans	16	12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.	11
Romans	16	13	Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.	11
Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who are with them.	11
Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.	11
Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss.  The assemblies of Christ greet you.	11
Romans	16	17	Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.	11
Romans	16	18	For those who are such don't serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.	11
Romans	16	19	For your obedience has become known to all.  I rejoice therefore over you.  But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil.	11
Romans	16	20	And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	11
Romans	16	21	Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.	11
Romans	16	22	I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.	11
Romans	16	23	Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother.	11
Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all!  Amen.	11
Romans	16	25	{See Romans 14:23}	11
Romans	16	26	{See Romans 14:23}	11
Titus	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be with you.  Amen.	12
Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,	12
Titus	1	2	in hope of eternal life, which God, who can't lie, promised before time began;	12
Titus	1	3	but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;	12
Titus	1	4	to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.	12
Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;	12
Titus	1	6	if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.	12
Titus	1	7	For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;	12
Titus	1	8	but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;	12
Titus	1	9	holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.	12
Titus	1	10	For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,	12
Titus	1	11	whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.	12
Titus	1	12	One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.	12
Titus	1	13	This testimony is true.  For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,	12
Titus	1	14	not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.	12
Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.	12
Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.	12
Titus	2	1	But say the things which fit sound doctrine,	12
Titus	2	2	that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:	12
Titus	2	3	and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;	12
Titus	2	4	that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,	12
Titus	2	5	to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.	12
Titus	2	6	Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;	12
Titus	2	7	in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,	12
Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that can't be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.	12
Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;	12
Titus	2	10	not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.	12
Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,	12
Titus	2	12	instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;	12
Titus	2	13	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;	12
Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.	12
Titus	2	15	Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.	12
Titus	3	1	Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,	12
Titus	3	2	to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.	12
Titus	3	3	For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.	12
Titus	3	4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,	12
Titus	3	5	not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,	12
Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;	12
Titus	3	7	that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	12
Titus	3	8	This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;	12
Titus	3	9	but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.	12
Titus	3	10	Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;	12
Titus	3	11	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.	12
Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.	12
Titus	3	13	Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.	12
Titus	3	14	Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.	12
Mark	28	20	teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.  Amen.	13
Mark	1	1	The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.	13
Mark	1	2	As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.{Malachi 3:1}	13
Mark	1	3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord!  Make his paths straight!'{Isaiah 40:3}	13
Mark	1	4	John came baptizing{or, immersing} in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.	13
Mark	1	5	All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him.  They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.	13
Mark	1	6	John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist.  He ate locusts and wild honey.	13
Mark	1	7	He preached, saying, After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.	13
Mark	1	8	I baptized you in{The Greek word (en) translated here as in could also be translated as with in some contexts.} water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.	13
Mark	1	9	It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.	13
Mark	1	10	Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.	13
Mark	1	11	A voice came out of the sky, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.	13
Mark	1	12	Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.	13
Mark	1	13	He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.	13
Mark	1	14	Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,	13
Mark	1	15	and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand!  Repent, and believe in the Good News.	13
Mark	1	16	Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.	13
Mark	1	17	Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.	13
Mark	1	18	Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.	13
Mark	1	19	Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.	13
Mark	1	20	Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.	13
Mark	1	21	They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.	13
Mark	1	22	They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.	13
Mark	1	23	Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,	13
Mark	1	24	saying, Ha!  What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene?  Have you come to destroy us?  I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!	13
Mark	1	25	Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!	13
Mark	1	26	The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.	13
Mark	1	27	They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this?  A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!	13
Mark	1	28	The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.	13
Mark	1	29	Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.	13
Mark	1	30	Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.	13
Mark	1	31	He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.	13
Mark	1	32	At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.	13
Mark	1	33	All the city was gathered together at the door.	13
Mark	1	34	He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons.  He didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.	13
Mark	1	35	Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.	13
Mark	1	36	Simon and those who were with him followed after him;	13
Mark	1	37	and they found him, and told him, Everyone is looking for you.	13
Mark	1	38	He said to them, Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.	13
Mark	1	39	He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.	13
Mark	1	40	A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you want to, you can make me clean.	13
Mark	1	41	Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I want to.  Be made clean.	13
Mark	1	42	When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.	13
Mark	1	43	He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,	13
Mark	1	44	and said to him, See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.	13
Mark	1	45	But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.	13
Mark	2	1	When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.	13
Mark	2	2	Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.	13
Mark	2	3	Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.	13
Mark	2	4	When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was.  When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.	13
Mark	2	5	Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you.	13
Mark	2	6	But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,	13
Mark	2	7	Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?	13
Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?	13
Mark	2	9	Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?'	13
Mark	2	10	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to the paralytic--	13
Mark	2	11	I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.	13
Mark	2	12	He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this!	13
Mark	2	13	He went out again by the seaside.  All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.	13
Mark	2	14	As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.	13
Mark	2	15	It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.	13
Mark	2	16	The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?	13
Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.	13
Mark	2	18	John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?	13
Mark	2	19	Jesus said to them, Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?  As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.	13
Mark	2	20	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.	13
Mark	2	21	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.	13
Mark	2	22	No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.	13
Mark	2	23	It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.	13
Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?	13
Mark	2	25	He said to them, Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?	13
Mark	2	26	How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?	13
Mark	2	27	He said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.	13
Mark	2	28	Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.	13
Mark	3	1	He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.	13
Mark	3	2	They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.	13
Mark	3	3	He said to the man who had his hand withered, Stand up.	13
Mark	3	4	He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm?  To save a life, or to kill? But they were silent.	13
Mark	3	5	When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand.  He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.	13
Mark	3	6	The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.	13
Mark	3	7	Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,	13
Mark	3	8	from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon.  A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.	13
Mark	3	9	He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him.	13
Mark	3	10	For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.	13
Mark	3	11	The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, You are the Son of God!	13
Mark	3	12	He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.	13
Mark	3	13	He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.	13
Mark	3	14	He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,	13
Mark	3	15	and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:	13
Mark	3	16	Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;	13
Mark	3	17	James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;	13
Mark	3	18	Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;	13
Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  He came into a house.	13
Mark	3	20	The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.	13
Mark	3	21	When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, He is insane.	13
Mark	3	22	The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.	13
Mark	3	23	He summoned them, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?	13
Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.	13
Mark	3	25	If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.	13
Mark	3	26	If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.	13
Mark	3	27	But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.	13
Mark	3	28	Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;	13
Mark	3	29	but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin	13
Mark	3	30	--because they said, He has an unclean spirit.	13
Mark	3	31	His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.	13
Mark	3	32	A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters{TR omits your sisters} are outside looking for you.	13
Mark	3	33	He answered them, Who are my mother and my brothers?	13
Mark	3	34	Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!	13
Mark	3	35	For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.	13
Mark	4	1	Again he began to teach by the seaside.  A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down.  All the multitude were on the land by the sea.	13
Mark	4	2	He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,	13
Mark	4	3	Listen!  Behold, the farmer went out to sow,	13
Mark	4	4	and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds{TR adds of the air} came and devoured it.	13
Mark	4	5	Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.	13
Mark	4	6	When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.	13
Mark	4	7	Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.	13
Mark	4	8	Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing.  Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.	13
Mark	4	9	He said, Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.	13
Mark	4	10	When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.	13
Mark	4	11	He said to them, To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,	13
Mark	4	12	that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'{Isaiah 6:9-10}	13
Mark	4	13	He said to them, Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?	13
Mark	4	14	The farmer sows the word.	13
Mark	4	15	The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.	13
Mark	4	16	These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.	13
Mark	4	17	They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.	13
Mark	4	18	Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,	13
Mark	4	19	and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.	13
Mark	4	20	Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.	13
Mark	4	21	He said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket{literally, a modion, a dry measuring basket containing about a peck (about 9 litres)} or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand?	13
Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.	13
Mark	4	23	If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.	13
Mark	4	24	He said to them, Take heed what you hear.  With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.	13
Mark	4	25	For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.	13
Mark	4	26	He said, The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,	13
Mark	4	27	and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.	13
Mark	4	28	For the earth bears fruit:  first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.	13
Mark	4	29	But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.	13
Mark	4	30	He said, How will we liken the Kingdom of God?  Or with what parable will we illustrate it?	13
Mark	4	31	It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,	13
Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.	13
Mark	4	33	With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.	13
Mark	4	34	Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.	13
Mark	4	35	On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let's go over to the other side.	13
Mark	4	36	Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat.  Other small boats were also with him.	13
Mark	4	37	A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.	13
Mark	4	38	He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?	13
Mark	4	39	He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still!  The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.	13
Mark	4	40	He said to them, Why are you so afraid?  How is it that you have no faith?	13
Mark	4	41	They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?	13
Mark	5	1	They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.	13
Mark	5	2	When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,	13
Mark	5	3	who had his dwelling in the tombs.  Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,	13
Mark	5	4	because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces.  Nobody had the strength to tame him.	13
Mark	5	5	Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.	13
Mark	5	6	When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,	13
Mark	5	7	and crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God?  I adjure you by God, don't torment me.	13
Mark	5	8	For he said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!	13
Mark	5	9	He asked him, What is your name?  He said to him, My name is Legion, for we are many.	13
Mark	5	10	He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.	13
Mark	5	11	Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding.	13
Mark	5	12	All the demons begged him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.	13
Mark	5	13	At once Jesus gave them permission.  The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs.  The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.	13
Mark	5	14	Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened.	13
Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.	13
Mark	5	16	Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.	13
Mark	5	17	They began to beg him to depart from their region.	13
Mark	5	18	As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.	13
Mark	5	19	He didn't allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.	13
Mark	5	20	He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.	13
Mark	5	21	When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.	13
Mark	5	22	Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,	13
Mark	5	23	and begged him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death.  Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.	13
Mark	5	24	He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.	13
Mark	5	25	A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,	13
Mark	5	26	and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,	13
Mark	5	27	having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.	13
Mark	5	28	For she said, If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.	13
Mark	5	29	Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.	13
Mark	5	30	Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, Who touched my clothes?	13
Mark	5	31	His disciples said to him, You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'	13
Mark	5	32	He looked around to see her who had done this thing.	13
Mark	5	33	But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.	13
Mark	5	34	He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.	13
Mark	5	35	While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, Your daughter is dead.  Why bother the Teacher any more?	13
Mark	5	36	But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, Don't be afraid, only believe.	13
Mark	5	37	He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.	13
Mark	5	38	He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.	13
Mark	5	39	When he had entered in, he said to them, Why do you make an uproar and weep?  The child is not dead, but is asleep.	13
Mark	5	40	They ridiculed him.  But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.	13
Mark	5	41	Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi; which means, being interpreted, Girl, I tell you, get up.	13
Mark	5	42	Immediately the girl rose up, and walked, for she was twelve years old.  They were amazed with great amazement.	13
Mark	5	43	He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.	13
Mark	6	1	He went out from there.  He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.	13
Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?	13
Mark	6	3	Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon?  Aren't his sisters here with us? They were offended at him.	13
Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.	13
Mark	6	5	He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them.	13
Mark	6	6	He marveled because of their unbelief.  He went around the villages teaching.	13
Mark	6	7	He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.	13
Mark	6	8	He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only:  no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,	13
Mark	6	9	but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.	13
Mark	6	10	He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.	13
Mark	6	11	Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them.  Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!	13
Mark	6	12	They went out and preached that people should repent.	13
Mark	6	13	They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.	13
Mark	6	14	King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.	13
Mark	6	15	But others said, It is Elijah.  Others said, It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets.	13
Mark	6	16	But Herod, when he heard this, said, This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.	13
Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.	13
Mark	6	18	For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.	13
Mark	6	19	Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't,	13
Mark	6	20	for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe.  When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.	13
Mark	6	21	Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.	13
Mark	6	22	When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.	13
Mark	6	23	He swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.	13
Mark	6	24	She went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? She said, The head of John the Baptizer.	13
Mark	6	25	She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.	13
Mark	6	26	The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her.	13
Mark	6	27	Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,	13
Mark	6	28	and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.	13
Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.	13
Mark	6	30	The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.	13
Mark	6	31	He said to them, You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.  For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.	13
Mark	6	32	They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.	13
Mark	6	33	They{TR reads The multitudes instead of They} saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.	13
Mark	6	34	Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.	13
Mark	6	35	When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.	13
Mark	6	36	Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.	13
Mark	6	37	But he answered them, You give them something to eat. They asked him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii{200 denarii was about 7 or 8 months wages for an agricultural laborer.} worth of bread, and give them something to eat?	13
Mark	6	38	He said to them, How many loaves do you have?  Go see. When they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.	13
Mark	6	39	He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.	13
Mark	6	40	They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.	13
Mark	6	41	He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.	13
Mark	6	42	They all ate, and were filled.	13
Mark	6	43	They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.	13
Mark	6	44	Those who ate the loaves were{TR adds about} five thousand men.	13
Mark	6	45	Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.	13
Mark	6	46	After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.	13
Mark	6	47	When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.	13
Mark	6	48	Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,	13
Mark	6	49	but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;	13
Mark	6	50	for they all saw him, and were troubled.  But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, Cheer up! It is I!{or, I AM!} Don't be afraid.	13
Mark	6	51	He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;	13
Mark	6	52	for they hadn't understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.	13
Mark	6	53	When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.	13
Mark	6	54	When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,	13
Mark	6	55	and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.	13
Mark	6	56	Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe{or, tassel} of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.	13
Mark	7	1	Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.	13
Mark	7	2	Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.	13
Mark	7	3	(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.	13
Mark	7	4	They don't eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to:  washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)	13
Mark	7	5	The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?	13
Mark	7	6	He answered them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.	13
Mark	7	7	But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'{Isaiah 29:13}	13
Mark	7	8	For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.	13
Mark	7	9	He said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.	13
Mark	7	10	For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;'{Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16} and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'{Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9}	13
Mark	7	11	But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban{Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.}, that is to say, given to God;'	13
Mark	7	12	then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,	13
Mark	7	13	making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down.  You do many things like this.	13
Mark	7	14	He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand.	13
Mark	7	15	There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.	13
Mark	7	16	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!	13
Mark	7	17	When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.	13
Mark	7	18	He said to them, Are you thus without understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can't defile him,	13
Mark	7	19	because it doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?	13
Mark	7	20	He said, That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.	13
Mark	7	21	For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,	13
Mark	7	22	covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.	13
Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.	13
Mark	7	24	From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon.  He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice.	13
Mark	7	25	For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.	13
Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.	13
Mark	7	27	But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.	13
Mark	7	28	But she answered him, Yes, Lord.  Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.	13
Mark	7	29	He said to her, For this saying, go your way.  The demon has gone out of your daughter.	13
Mark	7	30	She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.	13
Mark	7	31	Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.	13
Mark	7	32	They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech.  They begged him to lay his hand on him.	13
Mark	7	33	He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.	13
Mark	7	34	Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!	13
Mark	7	35	Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.	13
Mark	7	36	He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.	13
Mark	7	37	They were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well.  He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!	13
Mark	8	1	In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,	13
Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.	13
Mark	8	3	If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.	13
Mark	8	4	His disciples answered him, From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?	13
Mark	8	5	He asked them, How many loaves do you have?  They said, Seven.	13
Mark	8	6	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves.  Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.	13
Mark	8	7	They had a few small fish.  Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.	13
Mark	8	8	They ate, and were filled.  They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.	13
Mark	8	9	Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.	13
Mark	8	10	Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.	13
Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.	13
Mark	8	12	He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation{The word translated generation here (genea) could also be translated people, race, or family.} seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.	13
Mark	8	13	He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.	13
Mark	8	14	They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them.	13
Mark	8	15	He charged them, saying, Take heed:  beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.	13
Mark	8	16	They reasoned with one another, saying, It's because we have no bread.	13
Mark	8	17	Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread?  Don't you perceive yet, neither understand?  Is your heart still hardened?	13
Mark	8	18	Having eyes, don't you see?  Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember?	13
Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They told him, Twelve.	13
Mark	8	20	When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They told him, Seven.	13
Mark	8	21	He asked them, Don't you understand, yet?	13
Mark	8	22	He came to Bethsaida.  They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.	13
Mark	8	23	He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village.  When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.	13
Mark	8	24	He looked up, and said, I see men; for I see them like trees walking.	13
Mark	8	25	Then again he laid his hands on his eyes.  He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.	13
Mark	8	26	He sent him away to his house, saying, Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.	13
Mark	8	27	Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi.  On the way he asked his disciples, Who do men say that I am?	13
Mark	8	28	They told him, John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.	13
Mark	8	29	He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ.	13
Mark	8	30	He charged them that they should tell no one about him.	13
Mark	8	31	He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.	13
Mark	8	32	He spoke to them openly.  Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.	13
Mark	8	33	But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, Get behind me, Satan!  For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.	13
Mark	8	34	He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.	13
Mark	8	35	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.	13
Mark	8	36	For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?	13
Mark	8	37	For what will a man give in exchange for his life?	13
Mark	8	38	For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.	13
Mark	9	1	He said to them, Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power.	13
Mark	9	2	After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.	13
Mark	9	3	His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.	13
Mark	9	4	Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.	13
Mark	9	5	Peter answered Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents:  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.	13
Mark	9	6	For he didn't know what to say, for they were very afraid.	13
Mark	9	7	A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son.  Listen to him.	13
Mark	9	8	Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.	13
Mark	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.	13
Mark	9	10	They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.	13
Mark	9	11	They asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?	13
Mark	9	12	He said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?	13
Mark	9	13	But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.	13
Mark	9	14	Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.	13
Mark	9	15	Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.	13
Mark	9	16	He asked the scribes, What are you asking them?	13
Mark	9	17	One of the multitude answered, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;	13
Mark	9	18	and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able.	13
Mark	9	19	He answered him, Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you?  How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.	13
Mark	9	20	They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.	13
Mark	9	21	He asked his father, How long has it been since this has come to him?  He said, From childhood.	13
Mark	9	22	Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him.  But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.	13
Mark	9	23	Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.	13
Mark	9	24	Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, I believe. Help my unbelief!	13
Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!	13
Mark	9	26	Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, He is dead.	13
Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.	13
Mark	9	28	When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why couldn't we cast it out?	13
Mark	9	29	He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.	13
Mark	9	30	They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn't want anyone to know it.	13
Mark	9	31	For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.	13
Mark	9	32	But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.	13
Mark	9	33	He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?	13
Mark	9	34	But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.	13
Mark	9	35	He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.	13
Mark	9	36	He took a little child, and set him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,	13
Mark	9	37	Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't receive me, but him who sent me.	13
Mark	9	38	John said to him, Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow us.	13
Mark	9	39	But Jesus said, Don't forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.	13
Mark	9	40	For whoever is not against us is on our side.	13
Mark	9	41	For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.	13
Mark	9	42	Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.	13
Mark	9	43	If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna,{or, Hell} into the unquenchable fire,	13
Mark	9	44	'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'	13
Mark	9	45	If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna,{or, Hell} into the fire that will never be quenched--	13
Mark	9	46	'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'	13
Mark	9	47	If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna{or, Hell} of fire,	13
Mark	9	48	'where their worm doesn't die, and the fire is not quenched.'{Isaiah 66:24}	13
Mark	9	49	For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.	13
Mark	9	50	Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it?  Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.	13
Mark	10	1	He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan.  Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.	13
Mark	10	2	Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?	13
Mark	10	3	He answered, What did Moses command you?	13
Mark	10	4	They said, Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.	13
Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them, For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.	13
Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.{Genesis 1:27}	13
Mark	10	7	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,	13
Mark	10	8	and the two will become one flesh,{Genesis 2:24} so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.	13
Mark	10	9	What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.	13
Mark	10	10	In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.	13
Mark	10	11	He said to them, Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her.	13
Mark	10	12	If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery.	13
Mark	10	13	They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.	13
Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, Allow the little children to come to me! Don't forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.	13
Mark	10	15	Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.	13
Mark	10	16	He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.	13
Mark	10	17	As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?	13
Mark	10	18	Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good?  No one is good except one--God.	13
Mark	10	19	You know the commandments:  'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'{Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20}	13
Mark	10	20	He said to him, Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.	13
Mark	10	21	Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack.  Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.	13
Mark	10	22	But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.	13
Mark	10	23	Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!	13
Mark	10	24	The disciples were amazed at his words.  But Jesus answered again, Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!	13
Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.	13
Mark	10	26	They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, Then who can be saved?	13
Mark	10	27	Jesus, looking at them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.	13
Mark	10	28	Peter began to tell him, Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.	13
Mark	10	29	Jesus said, Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,	13
Mark	10	30	but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.	13
Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last; and the last first.	13
Mark	10	32	They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid.  He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.	13
Mark	10	33	Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.  The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.	13
Mark	10	34	They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.	13
Mark	10	35	James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.	13
Mark	10	36	He said to them, What do you want me to do for you?	13
Mark	10	37	They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.	13
Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them, You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?	13
Mark	10	39	They said to him, We are able.  Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;	13
Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.	13
Mark	10	41	When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.	13
Mark	10	42	Jesus summoned them, and said to them, You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.	13
Mark	10	43	But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.	13
Mark	10	44	Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all.	13
Mark	10	45	For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.	13
Mark	10	46	They came to Jericho.  As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.	13
Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!	13
Mark	10	48	Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, You son of David, have mercy on me!	13
Mark	10	49	Jesus stood still, and said, Call him.  They called the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up!  Get up. He is calling you!	13
Mark	10	50	He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.	13
Mark	10	51	Jesus asked him, What do you want me to do for you? The blind man said to him, Rhabboni,{Rhabboni is a transliteration of the Hebrew word for great teacher.} that I may see again.	13
Mark	10	52	Jesus said to him, Go your way.  Your faith has made you well. Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.	13
Mark	11	1	When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage{TR & NU read Bethphage instead of Bethsphage} and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,	13
Mark	11	2	and said to them, Go your way into the village that is opposite you.  Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.	13
Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here.	13
Mark	11	4	They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.	13
Mark	11	5	Some of those who stood there asked them, What are you doing, untying the young donkey?	13
Mark	11	6	They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.	13
Mark	11	7	They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.	13
Mark	11	8	Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road.	13
Mark	11	9	Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, Hosanna{Hosanna means save us or help us, we pray.}! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!{Psalm 118:25-26}	13
Mark	11	10	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord!  Hosanna in the highest!	13
Mark	11	11	Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem.  When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.	13
Mark	11	12	The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry.	13
Mark	11	13	Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it.  When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.	13
Mark	11	14	Jesus told it, May no one ever eat fruit from you again! and his disciples heard it.	13
Mark	11	15	They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.	13
Mark	11	16	He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.	13
Mark	11	17	He taught, saying to them, Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?'{Isaiah 56:7} But you have made it a den of robbers!{Jeremiah 7:11}	13
Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him.  For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.	13
Mark	11	19	When evening came, he went out of the city.	13
Mark	11	20	As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.	13
Mark	11	21	Peter, remembering, said to him, Rabbi, look!  The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.	13
Mark	11	22	Jesus answered them, Have faith in God.	13
Mark	11	23	For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.	13
Mark	11	24	Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.	13
Mark	11	25	Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.	13
Mark	11	26	But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.	13
Mark	11	27	They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,	13
Mark	11	28	and they began saying to him, By what authority do you do these things?  Or who gave you this authority to do these things?	13
Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them, I will ask you one question.  Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.	13
Mark	11	30	The baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.	13
Mark	11	31	They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'	13
Mark	11	32	If we should say, 'From men'--they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet.	13
Mark	11	33	They answered Jesus, We don't know.  Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.	13
Mark	12	1	He began to speak to them in parables.  A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.	13
Mark	12	2	When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.	13
Mark	12	3	They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.	13
Mark	12	4	Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.	13
Mark	12	5	Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.	13
Mark	12	6	Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'	13
Mark	12	7	But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'	13
Mark	12	8	They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.	13
Mark	12	9	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?  He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.	13
Mark	12	10	Haven't you even read this Scripture:  'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner.	13
Mark	12	11	This was from the Lord, it is marvelous in our eyes'?{Psalm 118:22-23}	13
Mark	12	12	They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.	13
Mark	12	13	They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.	13
Mark	12	14	When they had come, they asked him, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?	13
Mark	12	15	Shall we give, or shall we not give?  But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.	13
Mark	12	16	They brought it.  He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription?  They said to him, Caesar's.	13
Mark	12	17	Jesus answered them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. They marveled greatly at him.	13
Mark	12	18	There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,	13
Mark	12	19	Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.'	13
Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers.  The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.	13
Mark	12	21	The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;	13
Mark	12	22	and the seven took her and left no children.  Last of all the woman also died.	13
Mark	12	23	In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.	13
Mark	12	24	Jesus answered them, Isn't this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?	13
Mark	12	25	For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.	13
Mark	12	26	But about the dead, that they are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'{Exodus 3:6}?	13
Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.	13
Mark	12	28	One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is the greatest of all?	13
Mark	12	29	Jesus answered, The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:	13
Mark	12	30	you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.'{Deuteronomy 6:4-5} This is the first commandment.	13
Mark	12	31	The second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'{Leviticus 19:18} There is no other commandment greater than these.	13
Mark	12	32	The scribe said to him, Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,	13
Mark	12	33	and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.	13
Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the Kingdom of God.  No one dared ask him any question after that.	13
Mark	12	35	Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?	13
Mark	12	36	For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.'{Psalm 110:1}	13
Mark	12	37	Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son? The common people heard him gladly.	13
Mark	12	38	In his teaching he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,	13
Mark	12	39	and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:	13
Mark	12	40	those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers.  These will receive greater condemnation.	13
Mark	12	41	Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury.  Many who were rich cast in much.	13
Mark	12	42	A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins,{literally, lepta (or widow's mites).  Lepta are very small brass coins worth half a quadrans each, which is a quarter of the copper assarion. Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural worker's daily wages.} which equal a quadrans coin.{A quadrans is a coin worth about 1/64 of a denarius.  A denarius is about one day's wages for an agricultural laborer.}	13
Mark	12	43	He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,	13
Mark	12	44	for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.	13
Mark	13	1	As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!	13
Mark	13	2	Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.	13
Mark	13	3	As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,	13
Mark	13	4	Tell us, when will these things be?  What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?	13
Mark	13	5	Jesus, answering, began to tell them, Be careful that no one leads you astray.	13
Mark	13	6	For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!{or, I AM!}' and will lead many astray.	13
Mark	13	7	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.	13
Mark	13	8	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places.  There will be famines and troubles.  These things are the beginning of birth pains.	13
Mark	13	9	But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues.  You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.	13
Mark	13	10	The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.	13
Mark	13	11	When they lead you away and deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.	13
Mark	13	12	Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.	13
Mark	13	13	You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.	13
Mark	13	14	But when you see the abomination of desolation,{Daniel 9:17; 11:31; 12:11} spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,	13
Mark	13	15	and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.	13
Mark	13	16	Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.	13
Mark	13	17	But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!	13
Mark	13	18	Pray that your flight won't be in the winter.	13
Mark	13	19	For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.	13
Mark	13	20	Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.	13
Mark	13	21	Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it.	13
Mark	13	22	For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.	13
Mark	13	23	But you watch.  Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.	13
Mark	13	24	But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,	13
Mark	13	25	the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.{Isaiah 13:10; 34:4}	13
Mark	13	26	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.	13
Mark	13	27	Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.	13
Mark	13	28	Now from the fig tree, learn this parable.  When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;	13
Mark	13	29	even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.	13
Mark	13	30	Most certainly I say to you, this generation{The word translated generation (genea) could also be translated race, family, or people.} will not pass away until all these things happen.	13
Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.	13
Mark	13	32	But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.	13
Mark	13	33	Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don't know when the time is.	13
Mark	13	34	It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.	13
Mark	13	35	Watch therefore, for you don't know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;	13
Mark	13	36	lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.	13
Mark	13	37	What I tell you, I tell all:  Watch.	13
Mark	14	1	It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.	13
Mark	14	2	For they said, Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.	13
Mark	14	3	While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly.  She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.	13
Mark	14	4	But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, Why has this ointment been wasted?	13
Mark	14	5	For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,{300 denarii was about a years wages for an agricultural laborer.} and given to the poor.  They grumbled against her.	13
Mark	14	6	But Jesus said, Leave her alone.  Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.	13
Mark	14	7	For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.	13
Mark	14	8	She has done what she could.  She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.	13
Mark	14	9	Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.	13
Mark	14	10	Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.	13
Mark	14	11	They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.	13
Mark	14	12	On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?	13
Mark	14	13	He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,	13
Mark	14	14	and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'	13
Mark	14	15	He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there.	13
Mark	14	16	His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.	13
Mark	14	17	When it was evening he came with the twelve.	13
Mark	14	18	As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me.	13
Mark	14	19	They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, Surely not I?  And another said, Surely not I?	13
Mark	14	20	He answered them, It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.	13
Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.	13
Mark	14	22	As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat. This is my body.	13
Mark	14	23	He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.	13
Mark	14	24	He said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.	13
Mark	14	25	Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God.	13
Mark	14	26	When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.	13
Mark	14	27	Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'{Zechariah 13:7}	13
Mark	14	28	However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.	13
Mark	14	29	But Peter said to him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not.	13
Mark	14	30	Jesus said to him, Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.	13
Mark	14	31	But he spoke all the more, If I must die with you, I will not deny you.  They all said the same thing.	13
Mark	14	32	They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray.	13
Mark	14	33	He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.	13
Mark	14	34	He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.	13
Mark	14	35	He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.	13
Mark	14	36	He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me.  However, not what I desire, but what you desire.	13
Mark	14	37	He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping?  Couldn't you watch one hour?	13
Mark	14	38	Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.	13
Mark	14	39	Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.	13
Mark	14	40	Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him.	13
Mark	14	41	He came the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest.  It is enough.  The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.	13
Mark	14	42	Arise, let us be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.	13
Mark	14	43	Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.	13
Mark	14	44	Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whoever I will kiss, that is he.  Seize him, and lead him away safely.	13
Mark	14	45	When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, Rabbi!  Rabbi! and kissed him.	13
Mark	14	46	They laid their hands on him, and seized him.	13
Mark	14	47	But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.	13
Mark	14	48	Jesus answered them, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?	13
Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.  But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.	13
Mark	14	50	They all left him, and fled.	13
Mark	14	51	A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body.  The young men grabbed him,	13
Mark	14	52	but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.	13
Mark	14	53	They led Jesus away to the high priest.  All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.	13
Mark	14	54	Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest.  He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.	13
Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.	13
Mark	14	56	For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other.	13
Mark	14	57	Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,	13
Mark	14	58	We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'	13
Mark	14	59	Even so, their testimony did not agree.	13
Mark	14	60	The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer?  What is it which these testify against you?	13
Mark	14	61	But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing.  Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?	13
Mark	14	62	Jesus said, I am.  You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.	13
Mark	14	63	The high priest tore his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses?	13
Mark	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy!  What do you think? They all condemned him to be worthy of death.	13
Mark	14	65	Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, Prophesy!  The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.	13
Mark	14	66	As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,	13
Mark	14	67	and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!	13
Mark	14	68	But he denied it, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.  He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.	13
Mark	14	69	The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, This is one of them.	13
Mark	14	70	But he again denied it.  After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.	13
Mark	14	71	But he began to curse, and to swear, I don't know this man of whom you speak!	13
Mark	14	72	The rooster crowed the second time.  Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.  When he thought about that, he wept.	13
Mark	15	1	Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.	13
Mark	15	2	Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?  He answered, So you say.	13
Mark	15	3	The chief priests accused him of many things.	13
Mark	15	4	Pilate again asked him, Have you no answer?  See how many things they testify against you!	13
Mark	15	5	But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.	13
Mark	15	6	Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.	13
Mark	15	7	There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.	13
Mark	15	8	The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.	13
Mark	15	9	Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?	13
Mark	15	10	For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.	13
Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.	13
Mark	15	12	Pilate again asked them, What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?	13
Mark	15	13	They cried out again, Crucify him!	13
Mark	15	14	Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him!	13
Mark	15	15	Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.	13
Mark	15	16	The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.	13
Mark	15	17	They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.	13
Mark	15	18	They began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!	13
Mark	15	19	They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.	13
Mark	15	20	When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him.  They led him out to crucify him.	13
Mark	15	21	They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.	13
Mark	15	22	They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.	13
Mark	15	23	They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it.	13
Mark	15	24	Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.	13
Mark	15	25	It was the third hour,{9:00 A. M.} and they crucified him.	13
Mark	15	26	The superscription of his accusation was written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.	13
Mark	15	27	With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.	13
Mark	15	28	The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, He was numbered with transgressors.	13
Mark	15	29	Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha!  You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,	13
Mark	15	30	save yourself, and come down from the cross!	13
Mark	15	31	Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others.  He can't save himself.	13
Mark	15	32	Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.{TR omits him} Those who were crucified with him insulted him.	13
Mark	15	33	When the sixth hour{or, noon} had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.{3:00 PM}	13
Mark	15	34	At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?{Psalm 22:1}	13
Mark	15	35	Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah.	13
Mark	15	36	One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down.	13
Mark	15	37	Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.	13
Mark	15	38	The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.	13
Mark	15	39	When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God!	13
Mark	15	40	There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;	13
Mark	15	41	who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.	13
Mark	15	42	When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,	13
Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came.  He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.	13
Mark	15	44	Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.	13
Mark	15	45	When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.	13
Mark	15	46	He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.	13
Mark	15	47	Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.	13
Mark	16	1	When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.	13
Mark	16	2	Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.	13
Mark	16	3	They were saying among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?	13
Mark	16	4	for it was very big.  Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.	13
Mark	16	5	Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.	13
Mark	16	6	He said to them, Don't be amazed.  You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified.  He has risen. He is not here.  Behold, the place where they laid him!	13
Mark	16	7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee.  There you will see him, as he said to you.'	13
Mark	16	8	They went out,{TR adds quickly} and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.	13
Mark	16	9	Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.	13
Mark	16	10	She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.	13
Mark	16	11	When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.	13
Mark	16	12	After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.	13
Mark	16	13	They went away and told it to the rest.  They didn't believe them, either.	13
Mark	16	14	Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen.	13
Mark	16	15	He said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.	13
Mark	16	16	He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.	13
Mark	16	17	These signs will accompany those who believe:  in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;	13
Mark	16	18	they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.	13
Mark	16	19	So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.	13
Colossians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.	14
Colossians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,	14
Colossians	1	2	to the saints and faithful brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} in Christ at Colossae:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	14
Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	14
Colossians	1	4	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,	14
Colossians	1	5	because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,	14
Colossians	1	6	which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;	14
Colossians	1	7	even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,	14
Colossians	1	8	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.	14
Colossians	1	9	For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,	14
Colossians	1	10	that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;	14
Colossians	1	11	strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;	14
Colossians	1	12	giving thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;	14
Colossians	1	13	who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;	14
Colossians	1	14	in whom we have our redemption,{TR adds through his blood,} the forgiveness of our sins;	14
Colossians	1	15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.	14
Colossians	1	16	For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.	14
Colossians	1	17	He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.	14
Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.	14
Colossians	1	19	For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;	14
Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.	14
Colossians	1	21	You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,	14
Colossians	1	22	yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,	14
Colossians	1	23	if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.	14
Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the assembly;	14
Colossians	1	25	of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,	14
Colossians	1	26	the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,	14
Colossians	1	27	to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;	14
Colossians	1	28	whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;	14
Colossians	1	29	for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.	14
Colossians	2	1	For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;	14
Colossians	2	2	that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,	14
Colossians	2	3	in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.	14
Colossians	2	4	Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.	14
Colossians	2	5	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.	14
Colossians	2	6	As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,	14
Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.	14
Colossians	2	8	Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.	14
Colossians	2	9	For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,	14
Colossians	2	10	and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;	14
Colossians	2	11	in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;	14
Colossians	2	12	having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.	14
Colossians	2	13	You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh.  He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,	14
Colossians	2	14	wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;	14
Colossians	2	15	having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.	14
Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,	14
Colossians	2	17	which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.	14
Colossians	2	18	Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,	14
Colossians	2	19	and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.	14
Colossians	2	20	If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,	14
Colossians	2	21	Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch	14
Colossians	2	22	(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?	14
Colossians	2	23	Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.	14
Colossians	3	1	If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.	14
Colossians	3	2	Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.	14
Colossians	3	3	For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.	14
Colossians	3	4	When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.	14
Colossians	3	5	Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;	14
Colossians	3	6	for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.	14
Colossians	3	7	You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;	14
Colossians	3	8	but now you also put them all away:  anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.	14
Colossians	3	9	Don't lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,	14
Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,	14
Colossians	3	11	where there can't be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.	14
Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;	14
Colossians	3	13	bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.	14
Colossians	3	14	Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.	14
Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.	14
Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.	14
Colossians	3	17	Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.	14
Colossians	3	18	Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.	14
Colossians	3	19	Husbands, love your wives, and don't be bitter against them.	14
Colossians	3	20	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.	14
Colossians	3	21	Fathers, don't provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged.	14
Colossians	3	22	Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.	14
Colossians	3	23	And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,	14
Colossians	3	24	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.	14
Colossians	3	25	But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.	14
Colossians	4	1	Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.	14
Colossians	4	2	Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;	14
Colossians	4	3	praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;	14
Colossians	4	4	that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.	14
Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.	14
Colossians	4	6	Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.	14
Colossians	4	7	All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.	14
Colossians	4	8	I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,	14
Colossians	4	9	together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.  They will make known to you everything that is going on here.	14
Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, if he comes to you, receive him),	14
Colossians	4	11	and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.	14
Colossians	4	12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.	14
Colossians	4	13	For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.	14
Colossians	4	14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.	14
Colossians	4	15	Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.	14
Colossians	4	16	When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.	14
Colossians	4	17	Tell Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.	14
1 Corinthians	16	27	{See Romans 14:23} {TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27.}	15
1 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,	15
1 Corinthians	1	2	to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:	15
1 Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;	15
1 Corinthians	1	5	that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;	15
1 Corinthians	1	6	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:	15
1 Corinthians	1	7	so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;	15
1 Corinthians	1	8	who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	1	10	Now I beg you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	15
1 Corinthians	1	11	For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are contentions among you.	15
1 Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow Cephas, and, I follow Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided?  Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?	15
1 Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,	15
1 Corinthians	1	15	so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.	15
1 Corinthians	1	16	(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether I baptized any other.)	15
1 Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News-- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void.	15
1 Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.	15
1 Corinthians	1	19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.{Isaiah 29:14}	15
1 Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where is the lawyer of this world?  Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	15
1 Corinthians	1	21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.	15
1 Corinthians	1	22	For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,	15
1 Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,	15
1 Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.	15
1 Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	15
1 Corinthians	1	26	For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;	15
1 Corinthians	1	27	but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise.  God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;	15
1 Corinthians	1	28	and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:	15
1 Corinthians	1	29	that no flesh should boast before God.	15
1 Corinthians	1	30	But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:	15
1 Corinthians	1	31	that, according as it is written, He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}	15
1 Corinthians	2	1	When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.	15
1 Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	15
1 Corinthians	2	3	I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.	15
1 Corinthians	2	4	My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,	15
1 Corinthians	2	5	that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.	15
1 Corinthians	2	6	We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.	15
1 Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,	15
1 Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this world has known.  For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory.	15
1 Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written, Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear, which didn't enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him.{Isaiah 64:4}	15
1 Corinthians	2	10	But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.	15
1 Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him?  Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	2	12	But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.	15
1 Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.	15
1 Corinthians	2	14	Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are spiritually discerned.	15
1 Corinthians	2	15	But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.	15
1 Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?{Isaiah 40:13} But we have Christ's mind.	15
1 Corinthians	3	1	Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,	15
1 Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly.  For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk in the ways of men?	15
1 Corinthians	3	4	For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, aren't you fleshly?	15
1 Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?	15
1 Corinthians	3	6	I planted.  Apollos watered.  But God gave the increase.	15
1 Corinthians	3	7	So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.	15
1 Corinthians	3	8	Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.	15
1 Corinthians	3	9	For we are God's fellow workers.  You are God's farming, God's building.	15
1 Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.	15
1 Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	3	12	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;	15
1 Corinthians	3	13	each man's work will be revealed.  For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is.	15
1 Corinthians	3	14	If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.	15
1 Corinthians	3	15	If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.	15
1 Corinthians	3	16	Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?	15
1 Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.	15
1 Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself.  If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.	15
1 Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written, He has taken the wise in their craftiness.{Job 5:13}	15
1 Corinthians	3	20	And again, The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.{Psalm 94:11}	15
1 Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no one boast in men.  For all things are yours,	15
1 Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,	15
1 Corinthians	3	23	and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.	15
1 Corinthians	4	1	So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries.	15
1 Corinthians	4	2	Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.	15
1 Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment.  Yes, I don't judge my own self.	15
1 Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing against myself.  Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts.  Then each man will get his praise from God.	15
1 Corinthians	4	6	Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.	15
1 Corinthians	4	7	For who makes you different?  And what do you have that you didn't receive?  But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?	15
1 Corinthians	4	8	You are already filled.  You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us.  Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.	15
1 Corinthians	4	9	For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death.  For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.	15
1 Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong.  You have honor, but we have dishonor.	15
1 Corinthians	4	11	Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.	15
1 Corinthians	4	12	We toil, working with our own hands.  When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.	15
1 Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed, we entreat.  We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.	15
1 Corinthians	4	14	I don't write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.	15
1 Corinthians	4	15	For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.	15
1 Corinthians	4	16	I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.	15
1 Corinthians	4	17	Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.	15
1 Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.	15
1 Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.	15
1 Corinthians	4	20	For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.	15
1 Corinthians	4	21	What do you want?  Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?	15
1 Corinthians	5	1	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife.	15
1 Corinthians	5	2	You are puffed up, and didn't rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.	15
1 Corinthians	5	3	For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.	15
1 Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,	15
1 Corinthians	5	5	are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	15
1 Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good.  Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?	15
1 Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened.  For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.	15
1 Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.	15
1 Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;	15
1 Corinthians	5	10	yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.	15
1 Corinthians	5	11	But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don't even eat with such a person.	15
1 Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don't you judge those who are within?	15
1 Corinthians	5	13	But those who are outside, God judges.  Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.{Deuteronomy 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21; 24:7}	15
1 Corinthians	6	1	Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?	15
1 Corinthians	6	2	Don't you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	15
1 Corinthians	6	3	Don't you know that we will judge angels?  How much more, things that pertain to this life?	15
1 Corinthians	6	4	If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?	15
1 Corinthians	6	5	I say this to move you to shame.  Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?	15
1 Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!	15
1 Corinthians	6	7	Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another.  Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?	15
1 Corinthians	6	8	No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.	15
1 Corinthians	6	9	Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God?  Don't be deceived.  Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,	15
1 Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.	15
1 Corinthians	6	11	Such were some of you, but you were washed.  But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.	15
1 Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.	15
1 Corinthians	6	13	Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.	15
1 Corinthians	6	14	Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.	15
1 Corinthians	6	15	Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!	15
1 Corinthians	6	16	Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, The two, says he, will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}	15
1 Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	6	18	Flee sexual immorality!  Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.	15
1 Corinthians	6	19	Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God?  You are not your own,	15
1 Corinthians	6	20	for you were bought with a price.  Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.	15
1 Corinthians	7	1	Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.	15
1 Corinthians	7	2	But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.	15
1 Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.	15
1 Corinthians	7	4	The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but the wife.	15
1 Corinthians	7	5	Don't deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self-control.	15
1 Corinthians	7	6	But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.	15
1 Corinthians	7	7	Yet I wish that all men were like me.  However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.	15
1 Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.	15
1 Corinthians	7	9	But if they don't have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn.	15
1 Corinthians	7	10	But to the married I command--not I, but the Lord--that the wife not leave her husband	15
1 Corinthians	7	11	(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.	15
1 Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest I--not the Lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.	15
1 Corinthians	7	13	The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.	15
1 Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.	15
1 Corinthians	7	15	Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.	15
1 Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?	15
1 Corinthians	7	17	Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk.  So I command in all the assemblies.	15
1 Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called having been circumcised?  Let him not become uncircumcised.  Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.	15
1 Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.	15
1 Corinthians	7	20	Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.	15
1 Corinthians	7	21	Were you called being a bondservant?  Don't let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.	15
1 Corinthians	7	22	For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man.  Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant.	15
1 Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price.  Don't become bondservants of men.	15
1 Corinthians	7	24	Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.	15
1 Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.	15
1 Corinthians	7	26	I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.	15
1 Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife?  Don't seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife?  Don't seek a wife.	15
1 Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry, you have not sinned.  If a virgin marries, she has not sinned.  Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.	15
1 Corinthians	7	29	But I say this, brothers:  the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;	15
1 Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;	15
1 Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.	15
1 Corinthians	7	32	But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;	15
1 Corinthians	7	33	but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.	15
1 Corinthians	7	34	There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world-- how she may please her husband.	15
1 Corinthians	7	35	This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.	15
1 Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn't sin.  Let them marry.	15
1 Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.	15
1 Corinthians	7	38	So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.	15
1 Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever she desires, only in the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	8	1	Now concerning things sacrificed to idols:  We know that we all have knowledge.  Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.	15
1 Corinthians	8	2	But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn't yet know as he ought to know.	15
1 Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.	15
1 Corinthians	8	4	Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.	15
1 Corinthians	8	5	For though there are things that are called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many gods and many lords;	15
1 Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.	15
1 Corinthians	8	7	However, that knowledge isn't in all men.  But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.	15
1 Corinthians	8	8	But food will not commend us to God.  For neither, if we don't eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.	15
1 Corinthians	8	9	But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.	15
1 Corinthians	8	10	For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?	15
1 Corinthians	8	11	And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.	15
1 Corinthians	8	12	Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	8	13	Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don't cause my brother to stumble.	15
1 Corinthians	9	1	Am I not free?  Am I not an apostle?  Haven't I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord?  Aren't you my work in the Lord?	15
1 Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this.	15
1 Corinthians	9	4	Have we no right to eat and to drink?	15
1 Corinthians	9	5	Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?	15
1 Corinthians	9	6	Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?	15
1 Corinthians	9	7	What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn't eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn't drink from the flock's milk?	15
1 Corinthians	9	8	Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing?	15
1 Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} Is it for the oxen that God cares,	15
1 Corinthians	9	10	or does he say it assuredly for our sake?  Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.	15
1 Corinthians	9	11	If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?	15
1 Corinthians	9	12	If others partake of this right over you, don't we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	9	13	Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?	15
1 Corinthians	9	14	Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.	15
1 Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things, and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.	15
1 Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don't preach the Good News.	15
1 Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.	15
1 Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward?  That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.	15
1 Corinthians	9	19	For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.	15
1 Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;	15
1 Corinthians	9	21	to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.	15
1 Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.	15
1 Corinthians	9	23	Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.	15
1 Corinthians	9	24	Don't you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize?  Run like that, that you may win.	15
1 Corinthians	9	25	Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things.  Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.	15
1 Corinthians	9	26	I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly.  I fight like that, as not beating the air,	15
1 Corinthians	9	27	but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.	15
1 Corinthians	10	1	Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	15
1 Corinthians	10	2	and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	15
1 Corinthians	10	3	and all ate the same spiritual food;	15
1 Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink.  For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	10	5	However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.	15
1 Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.	15
1 Corinthians	10	7	Neither be idolaters, as some of them were.  As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.{Exodus 32:6}	15
1 Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.	15
1 Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.	15
1 Corinthians	10	10	Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.	15
1 Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.	15
1 Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall.	15
1 Corinthians	10	13	No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.	15
1 Corinthians	10	14	Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.	15
1 Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men.  Judge what I say.	15
1 Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless, isn't it a communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, isn't it a communion of the body of Christ?	15
1 Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.	15
1 Corinthians	10	18	Consider Israel according to the flesh.  Don't those who eat the sacrifices have communion with the altar?	15
1 Corinthians	10	19	What am I saying then?  That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?	15
1 Corinthians	10	20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don't desire that you would have communion with demons.	15
1 Corinthians	10	21	You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can't both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.	15
1 Corinthians	10	22	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  Are we stronger than he?	15
1 Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.	15
1 Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor's good.	15
1 Corinthians	10	25	Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,	15
1 Corinthians	10	26	for the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness.{Psalm 24:1}	15
1 Corinthians	10	27	But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.	15
1 Corinthians	10	28	But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience.  For the earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness.	15
1 Corinthians	10	29	Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?	15
1 Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?	15
1 Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.	15
1 Corinthians	10	32	Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;	15
1 Corinthians	10	33	even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.	15
1 Corinthians	11	1	Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.	15
1 Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.	15
1 Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.	15
1 Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head.  For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.	15
1 Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.	15
1 Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.	15
1 Corinthians	11	8	For man is not from woman, but woman from man;	15
1 Corinthians	11	9	for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.	15
1 Corinthians	11	10	For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.	15
1 Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	11	12	For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.	15
1 Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves.  Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?	15
1 Corinthians	11	14	Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?	15
1 Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.	15
1 Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's assemblies.	15
1 Corinthians	11	17	But in giving you this command, I don't praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.	15
1 Corinthians	11	18	For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.	15
1 Corinthians	11	19	For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.	15
1 Corinthians	11	20	When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.	15
1 Corinthians	11	21	For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.	15
1 Corinthians	11	22	What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have?  What shall I tell you?  Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.	15
1 Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.	15
1 Corinthians	11	24	When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you.  Do this in memory of me.	15
1 Corinthians	11	25	In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.	15
1 Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.	15
1 Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.	15
1 Corinthians	11	29	For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn't discern the Lord's body.	15
1 Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.	15
1 Corinthians	11	31	For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.	15
1 Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.	15
1 Corinthians	11	33	Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.	15
1 Corinthians	11	34	But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment.  The rest I will set in order whenever I come.	15
1 Corinthians	12	1	Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.	15
1 Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathen{or Gentiles}, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.	15
1 Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, Jesus is accursed.  No one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	12	4	Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	12	5	There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	12	6	There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.	15
1 Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.	15
1 Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;	15
1 Corinthians	12	9	to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;	15
1 Corinthians	12	10	and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.	15
1 Corinthians	12	11	But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.	15
1 Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member, but many.	15
1 Corinthians	12	15	If the foot would say, Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body, it is not therefore not part of the body.	15
1 Corinthians	12	16	If the ear would say, Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body, it's not therefore not part of the body.	15
1 Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?	15
1 Corinthians	12	18	But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.	15
1 Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one member, where would the body be?	15
1 Corinthians	12	20	But now they are many members, but one body.	15
1 Corinthians	12	21	The eye can't tell the hand, I have no need for you, or again the head to the feet, I have no need for you.	15
1 Corinthians	12	22	No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.	15
1 Corinthians	12	23	Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;	15
1 Corinthians	12	24	whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,	15
1 Corinthians	12	25	that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.	15
1 Corinthians	12	26	When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.	15
1 Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.	15
1 Corinthians	12	28	God has set some in the assembly:  first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.	15
1 Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles?  Are all prophets?  Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?	15
1 Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healings?  Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?	15
1 Corinthians	12	31	But earnestly desire the best gifts.  Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.	15
1 Corinthians	13	1	If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don't have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.	15
1 Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don't have love, I am nothing.	15
1 Corinthians	13	3	If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don't have love, it profits me nothing.	15
1 Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and is kind; love doesn't envy. Love doesn't brag, is not proud,	15
1 Corinthians	13	5	doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;	15
1 Corinthians	13	6	doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;	15
1 Corinthians	13	7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.	15
1 Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails.  But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with.  Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.	15
1 Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;	15
1 Corinthians	13	10	but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.	15
1 Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child.  Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.	15
1 Corinthians	13	12	For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.	15
1 Corinthians	13	13	But now faith, hope, and love remain--these three. The greatest of these is love.	15
1 Corinthians	14	1	Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.	15
1 Corinthians	14	2	For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.	15
1 Corinthians	14	3	But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.	15
1 Corinthians	14	4	He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.	15
1 Corinthians	14	5	Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy.  For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.	15
1 Corinthians	14	6	But now, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?	15
1 Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?	15
1 Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?	15
1 Corinthians	14	9	So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.	15
1 Corinthians	14	10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.	15
1 Corinthians	14	11	If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.	15
1 Corinthians	14	12	So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.	15
1 Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.	15
1 Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.	15
1 Corinthians	14	15	What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.  I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.	15
1 Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?	15
1 Corinthians	14	17	For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.	15
1 Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.	15
1 Corinthians	14	19	However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.	15
1 Corinthians	14	20	Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.	15
1 Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written, By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.{Isaiah 28:11-12}	15
1 Corinthians	14	22	Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.	15
1 Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?	15
1 Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.	15
1 Corinthians	14	25	And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.  So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.	15
1 Corinthians	14	26	What is it then, brothers?  When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation.  Let all things be done to build each other up.	15
1 Corinthians	14	27	If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.	15
1 Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.	15
1 Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.	15
1 Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.	15
1 Corinthians	14	31	For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.	15
1 Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,	15
1 Corinthians	14	33	for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,	15
1 Corinthians	14	34	let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.	15
1 Corinthians	14	35	If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.	15
1 Corinthians	14	36	What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?	15
1 Corinthians	14	37	If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.	15
1 Corinthians	14	39	Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking with other languages.	15
1 Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order.	15
1 Corinthians	15	1	Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,	15
1 Corinthians	15	2	by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.	15
1 Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,	15
1 Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,	15
1 Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.	15
1 Corinthians	15	6	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.	15
1 Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,	15
1 Corinthians	15	8	and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.	15
1 Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.	15
1 Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am.  His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.	15
1 Corinthians	15	11	Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.	15
1 Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?	15
1 Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.	15
1 Corinthians	15	14	If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.	15
1 Corinthians	15	15	Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.	15
1 Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.	15
1 Corinthians	15	17	If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.	15
1 Corinthians	15	18	Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.	15
1 Corinthians	15	19	If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.	15
1 Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead.  He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.	15
1 Corinthians	15	21	For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.	15
1 Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.	15
1 Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order:  Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.	15
1 Corinthians	15	24	Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.	15
1 Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.	15
1 Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be abolished is death.	15
1 Corinthians	15	27	For, He put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:6} But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.	15
1 Corinthians	15	28	When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.	15
1 Corinthians	15	29	Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?	15
1 Corinthians	15	30	Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?	15
1 Corinthians	15	31	I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.	15
1 Corinthians	15	32	If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me?  If the dead are not raised, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.{Isaiah 22:13}	15
1 Corinthians	15	33	Don't be deceived!  Evil companionships corrupt good morals.	15
1 Corinthians	15	34	Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge of God.  I say this to your shame.	15
1 Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say, How are the dead raised? and, With what kind of body do they come?	15
1 Corinthians	15	36	You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.	15
1 Corinthians	15	37	That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.	15
1 Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.	15
1 Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.	15
1 Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.	15
1 Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.	15
1 Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.	15
1 Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.  It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.	15
1 Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.	15
1 Corinthians	15	45	So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul.{Genesis 2:7} The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.	15
1 Corinthians	15	46	However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.	15
1 Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth, made of dust.  The second man is the Lord from heaven.	15
1 Corinthians	15	48	As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.	15
1 Corinthians	15	49	As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's{NU, TR read we will instead of let's} also bear the image of the heavenly.	15
1 Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.	15
1 Corinthians	15	51	Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,	15
1 Corinthians	15	52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.	15
1 Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.	15
1 Corinthians	15	54	But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen:  Death is swallowed up in victory.{Isaiah 25:8}	15
1 Corinthians	15	55	Death, where is your sting?  Hades{or, Hell}, where is your victory?{Hosea 13:14}	15
1 Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.	15
1 Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	15
1 Corinthians	15	58	Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.	15
1 Corinthians	16	1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.	15
1 Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.	15
1 Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.	15
1 Corinthians	16	4	If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.	15
1 Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.	15
1 Corinthians	16	6	But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.	15
1 Corinthians	16	7	For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.	15
1 Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,	15
1 Corinthians	16	9	for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.	15
1 Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.	15
1 Corinthians	16	11	Therefore let no one despise him.  But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.	15
1 Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.	15
1 Corinthians	16	13	Watch!  Stand firm in the faith!  Be courageous!  Be strong!	15
1 Corinthians	16	14	Let all that you do be done in love.	15
1 Corinthians	16	15	Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),	15
1 Corinthians	16	16	that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.	15
1 Corinthians	16	17	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.	15
1 Corinthians	16	18	For they refreshed my spirit and yours.  Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.	15
1 Corinthians	16	19	The assemblies of Asia greet you.  Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.	15
1 Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers greet you.  Greet one another with a holy kiss.	15
1 Corinthians	16	21	This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.	15
1 Corinthians	16	22	If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed{Greek: anathema.}. Come, Lord!{Aramaic: Maranatha!}	15
1 Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	15
2 Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.  Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.	16
2 Peter	1	1	Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:	16
2 Peter	1	2	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,	16
2 Peter	1	3	seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;	16
2 Peter	1	4	by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.	16
2 Peter	1	5	Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;	16
2 Peter	1	6	and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;	16
2 Peter	1	7	and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love.	16
2 Peter	1	8	For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	16
2 Peter	1	9	For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.	16
2 Peter	1	10	Therefore, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} be more diligent to make your calling and election sure.  For if you do these things, you will never stumble.	16
2 Peter	1	11	For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.	16
2 Peter	1	12	Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth.	16
2 Peter	1	13	I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;	16
2 Peter	1	14	knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.	16
2 Peter	1	15	Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure.	16
2 Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	16
2 Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.{Matthew 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35}	16
2 Peter	1	18	We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.	16
2 Peter	1	19	We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:	16
2 Peter	1	20	knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.	16
2 Peter	1	21	For no prophecy ever came by the will of man:  but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.	16
2 Peter	2	1	But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.	16
2 Peter	2	2	Many will follow their immoral{TR reads destructive instead of immoral} ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned.	16
2 Peter	2	3	In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old doesn't linger, and their destruction will not slumber.	16
2 Peter	2	4	For if God didn't spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus{Tartarus is another name for Hell}, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;	16
2 Peter	2	5	and didn't spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;	16
2 Peter	2	6	and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;	16
2 Peter	2	7	and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked	16
2 Peter	2	8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds):	16
2 Peter	2	9	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;	16
2 Peter	2	10	but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority.  Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;	16
2 Peter	2	11	whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don't bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.	16
2 Peter	2	12	But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,	16
2 Peter	2	13	receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;	16
2 Peter	2	14	having eyes full of adultery, and who can't cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;	16
2 Peter	2	15	forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrong-doing;	16
2 Peter	2	16	but he was rebuked for his own disobedience.  A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.	16
2 Peter	2	17	These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.	16
2 Peter	2	18	For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;	16
2 Peter	2	19	promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him.	16
2 Peter	2	20	For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.	16
2 Peter	2	21	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.	16
2 Peter	2	22	But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns to his own vomit again,{Proverbs 26:11} and the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire.	16
2 Peter	3	1	This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;	16
2 Peter	3	2	that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior:	16
2 Peter	3	3	knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,	16
2 Peter	3	4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming?  For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.	16
2 Peter	3	5	For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;	16
2 Peter	3	6	by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.	16
2 Peter	3	7	But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.	16
2 Peter	3	8	But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	16
2 Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	16
2 Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.	16
2 Peter	3	11	Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,	16
2 Peter	3	12	looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?	16
2 Peter	3	13	But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.	16
2 Peter	3	14	Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight.	16
2 Peter	3	15	Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;	16
2 Peter	3	16	as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.	16
2 Peter	3	17	You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness.	16
1 Timothy	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.	17
1 Timothy	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;	17
1 Timothy	1	2	to Timothy, my true child in faith:  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	17
1 Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,	17
1 Timothy	1	4	neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith--	17
1 Timothy	1	5	but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;	17
1 Timothy	1	6	from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;	17
1 Timothy	1	7	desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.	17
1 Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,	17
1 Timothy	1	9	as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	17
1 Timothy	1	10	for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;	17
1 Timothy	1	11	according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.	17
1 Timothy	1	12	And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;	17
1 Timothy	1	13	although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.	17
1 Timothy	1	14	The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	17
1 Timothy	1	15	The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	17
1 Timothy	1	16	However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.	17
1 Timothy	1	17	Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever.  Amen.	17
1 Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;	17
1 Timothy	1	19	holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;	17
1 Timothy	1	20	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.	17
1 Timothy	2	1	I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:	17
1 Timothy	2	2	for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.	17
1 Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;	17
1 Timothy	2	4	who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.	17
1 Timothy	2	5	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,	17
1 Timothy	2	6	who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;	17
1 Timothy	2	7	to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.	17
1 Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.	17
1 Timothy	2	9	In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;	17
1 Timothy	2	10	but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.	17
1 Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.	17
1 Timothy	2	12	But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.	17
1 Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.	17
1 Timothy	2	14	Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;	17
1 Timothy	2	15	but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.	17
1 Timothy	3	1	This is a faithful saying:  if a man seeks the office of an overseer{or, superintendents, or bishops}, he desires a good work.	17
1 Timothy	3	2	The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;	17
1 Timothy	3	3	not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;	17
1 Timothy	3	4	one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;	17
1 Timothy	3	5	(but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)	17
1 Timothy	3	6	not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.	17
1 Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.	17
1 Timothy	3	8	Servants{or, Deacons.}, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;	17
1 Timothy	3	9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.	17
1 Timothy	3	10	Let them also first be tested; then let them serve{or, serve as deacons} if they are blameless.	17
1 Timothy	3	11	Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.	17
1 Timothy	3	12	Let servants{or, deacons} be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.	17
1 Timothy	3	13	For those who have served well{or, served well as deacons} gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	17
1 Timothy	3	14	These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;	17
1 Timothy	3	15	but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.	17
1 Timothy	3	16	Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.	17
1 Timothy	4	1	But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,	17
1 Timothy	4	2	through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;	17
1 Timothy	4	3	forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.	17
1 Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.	17
1 Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.	17
1 Timothy	4	6	If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.	17
1 Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives' fables.  Exercise yourself toward godliness.	17
1 Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.	17
1 Timothy	4	9	This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.	17
1 Timothy	4	10	For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.	17
1 Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things.	17
1 Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.	17
1 Timothy	4	13	Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.	17
1 Timothy	4	14	Don't neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.	17
1 Timothy	4	15	Be diligent in these things.  Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.	17
1 Timothy	4	16	Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.	17
1 Timothy	5	1	Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;	17
1 Timothy	5	2	the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.	17
1 Timothy	5	3	Honor widows who are widows indeed.	17
1 Timothy	5	4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is{TR adds good and} acceptable in the sight of God.	17
1 Timothy	5	5	Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.	17
1 Timothy	5	6	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.	17
1 Timothy	5	7	Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.	17
1 Timothy	5	8	But if anyone doesn't provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.	17
1 Timothy	5	9	Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,	17
1 Timothy	5	10	being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.	17
1 Timothy	5	11	But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;	17
1 Timothy	5	12	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.	17
1 Timothy	5	13	Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.	17
1 Timothy	5	14	I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.	17
1 Timothy	5	15	For already some have turned aside after Satan.	17
1 Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.	17
1 Timothy	5	17	Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.	17
1 Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.{Deuteronomy 25:4} And, The laborer is worthy of his wages.{Luke 10:7; Leviticus 19:13}	17
1 Timothy	5	19	Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.	17
1 Timothy	5	20	Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.	17
1 Timothy	5	21	I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.	17
1 Timothy	5	22	Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins.  Keep yourself pure.	17
1 Timothy	5	23	Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.	17
1 Timothy	5	24	Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.	17
1 Timothy	5	25	In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.	17
1 Timothy	6	1	Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.	17
1 Timothy	6	2	Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.	17
1 Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn't consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,	17
1 Timothy	6	4	he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,	17
1 Timothy	6	5	constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.{NU omits Withdraw yourself from such.}	17
1 Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	17
1 Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can't carry anything out.	17
1 Timothy	6	8	But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.	17
1 Timothy	6	9	But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.	17
1 Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	17
1 Timothy	6	11	But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.	17
1 Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith.  Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.	17
1 Timothy	6	13	I charge you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,	17
1 Timothy	6	14	that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;	17
1 Timothy	6	15	which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;	17
1 Timothy	6	16	who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see:  to whom be honor and eternal power.  Amen.	17
1 Timothy	6	17	Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;	17
1 Timothy	6	18	that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;	17
1 Timothy	6	19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.	17
1 Timothy	6	20	Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;	17
1 Thessalonians	4	18	The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand:  remember my bonds. Grace be with you.  Amen.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	2	We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,	18
1 Thessalonians	1	3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	4	We know, brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} loved by God, that you are chosen,	18
1 Thessalonians	1	5	and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	6	You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,	18
1 Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	8	For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.	18
1 Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,	18
1 Thessalonians	1	10	and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	1	For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasn't in vain,	18
1 Thessalonians	2	2	but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	4	But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	5	For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),	18
1 Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	8	Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	11	As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children,	18
1 Thessalonians	2	12	to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	14	For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;	18
1 Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and didn't please God, and are contrary to all men;	18
1 Thessalonians	2	16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always.  But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	17	But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,	18
1 Thessalonians	2	18	because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paul, once and again-- but Satan hindered us.	18
1 Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn't it even you, before our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} at his coming?	18
1 Thessalonians	2	20	For you are our glory and our joy.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	1	Therefore, when we couldn't stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,	18
1 Thessalonians	3	2	and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;	18
1 Thessalonians	3	3	that no one be moved by these afflictions.  For you know that we are appointed to this task.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	4	For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause I also, when I couldn't stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	6	But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;	18
1 Thessalonians	3	7	for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.	18
1 Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;	18
1 Thessalonians	3	10	night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	18
1 Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;	18
1 Thessalonians	3	12	and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,	18
1 Thessalonians	3	13	to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	1	Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God:  your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,	18
1 Thessalonians	4	4	that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,	18
1 Thessalonians	4	5	not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don't know God;	18
1 Thessalonians	4	6	that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	7	For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you.  For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,	18
1 Thessalonians	4	10	for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia.  But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;	18
1 Thessalonians	4	11	and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we charged you;	18
1 Thessalonians	4	12	that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	13	But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you don't grieve like the rest, who have no hope.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	15	For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,	18
1 Thessalonians	4	17	then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.	18
1 Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	1	But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	3	For when they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	4	But you, brothers, aren't in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	5	You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don't belong to the night, nor to darkness,	18
1 Thessalonians	5	6	so then let's not sleep, as the rest do, but let's watch and be sober.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	8	But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	9	For God didn't appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,	18
1 Thessalonians	5	10	who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	12	But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,	18
1 Thessalonians	5	13	and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	14	We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	15	See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice always.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	18	In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	19	Don't quench the Spirit.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	20	Don't despise prophesies.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	21	Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from every form of evil.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	23	May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	24	He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	25	Brothers, pray for us.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.	18
1 Thessalonians	5	27	I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.	18
Esther	13	31	and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.  Remember me, my God, for good.	19
Esther	1	1	Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),	19
Esther	1	2	that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,	19
Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.	19
Esther	1	4	He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.	19
Esther	1	5	When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.	19
Esther	1	6	There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars.  The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.	19
Esther	1	7	They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.	19
Esther	1	8	In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.	19
Esther	1	9	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.	19
Esther	1	10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,	19
Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.	19
Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the eunuchs.  Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.	19
Esther	1	13	Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;	19
Esther	1	14	and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),	19
Esther	1	15	What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?	19
Esther	1	16	Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.	19
Esther	1	17	For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.'	19
Esther	1	18	Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.	19
Esther	1	19	If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.	19
Esther	1	20	When the king's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.	19
Esther	1	21	This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:	19
Esther	1	22	for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.	19
Esther	2	1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.	19
Esther	2	2	Then the king's servants who served him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.	19
Esther	2	3	Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;	19
Esther	2	4	and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king, and he did so.	19
Esther	2	5	There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,	19
Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.	19
Esther	2	7	He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother.  The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.	19
Esther	2	8	So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.	19
Esther	2	9	The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house.  He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house.	19
Esther	2	10	Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.	19
Esther	2	11	Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.	19
Esther	2	12	Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).	19
Esther	2	13	The young woman then came to the king like this:  whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house.	19
Esther	2	14	In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines.  She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.	19
Esther	2	15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised.  Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.	19
Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.	19
Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.	19
Esther	2	18	Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.	19
Esther	2	19	When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.	19
Esther	2	20	Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.	19
Esther	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.	19
Esther	2	22	This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.	19
Esther	2	23	When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence.	19
Esther	3	1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.	19
Esther	3	2	All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him.  But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.	19
Esther	3	3	Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you disobey the king's commandment?	19
Esther	3	4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.	19
Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.	19
Esther	3	6	But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.	19
Esther	3	7	In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	19
Esther	3	8	Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.	19
Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.	19
Esther	3	10	The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.	19
Esther	3	11	The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.	19
Esther	3	12	Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language.  It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring.	19
Esther	3	13	Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.	19
Esther	3	14	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.	19
Esther	3	15	The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.	19
Esther	4	1	Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.	19
Esther	4	2	He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.	19
Esther	4	3	In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.	19
Esther	4	4	Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved.  She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.	19
Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.	19
Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate.	19
Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.	19
Esther	4	8	He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people.	19
Esther	4	9	Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.	19
Esther	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:	19
Esther	4	11	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.	19
Esther	4	12	They told to Mordecai Esther's words.	19
Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, Don't think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.	19
Esther	4	14	For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish.  Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?	19
Esther	4	15	Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,	19
Esther	4	16	Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day.  I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.	19
Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.	19
Esther	5	1	Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house.  The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.	19
Esther	5	2	When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.	19
Esther	5	3	Then the king asked her, What would you like, queen Esther?  What is your request?  It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.	19
Esther	5	4	Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.	19
Esther	5	5	Then the king said, Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.  So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	19
Esther	5	6	The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	19
Esther	5	7	Then Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is this.	19
Esther	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.	19
Esther	5	9	Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.	19
Esther	5	10	Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.	19
Esther	5	11	Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.	19
Esther	5	12	Haman also said, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.	19
Esther	5	13	Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.	19
Esther	5	14	Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.	19
Esther	6	1	On that night, the king couldn't sleep.  He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.	19
Esther	6	2	It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.	19
Esther	6	3	The king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?  Then the king's servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him.	19
Esther	6	4	The king said, Who is in the court?  Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.	19
Esther	6	5	The king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. The king said, Let him come in.	19
Esther	6	6	So Haman came in.  The king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?	19
Esther	6	7	Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,	19
Esther	6	8	let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set.	19
Esther	6	9	Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!'	19
Esther	6	10	Then the king said to Haman, Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate.  Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.	19
Esther	6	11	Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!	19
Esther	6	12	Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.	19
Esther	6	13	Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.  Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.	19
Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.	19
Esther	7	1	So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.	19
Esther	7	2	The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request?  Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.	19
Esther	7	3	Then Esther the queen answered, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.	19
Esther	7	4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.  But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's loss.	19
Esther	7	5	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?	19
Esther	7	6	Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!  Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.	19
Esther	7	7	The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden.  Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.	19
Esther	7	8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was.  Then the king said, Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?  As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.	19
Esther	7	9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman's house.  The king said, Hang him on it!	19
Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.  Then was the king's wrath pacified.	19
Esther	8	1	On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen.  Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.	19
Esther	8	2	The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.  Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.	19
Esther	8	3	Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.	19
Esther	8	4	Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.	19
Esther	8	5	She said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.	19
Esther	8	6	For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?	19
Esther	8	7	Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews.	19
Esther	8	8	Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may not be reversed by any man.	19
Esther	8	9	Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.	19
Esther	8	10	He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds.	19
Esther	8	11	In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,	19
Esther	8	12	on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.	19
Esther	8	13	A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.	19
Esther	8	14	So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.	19
Esther	8	15	Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.	19
Esther	8	16	The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.	19
Esther	8	17	In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day.  Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.	19
Esther	9	1	Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),	19
Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them.  No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.	19
Esther	9	3	All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.	19
Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.	19
Esther	9	5	The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.	19
Esther	9	6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.	19
Esther	9	7	They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,	19
Esther	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,	19
Esther	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,	19
Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.	19
Esther	9	11	On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.	19
Esther	9	12	The king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!  Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you.  What is your further request? It shall be done.	19
Esther	9	13	Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.	19
Esther	9	14	The king commanded this to be done.  A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.	19
Esther	9	15	The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn't lay their hand on the spoil.	19
Esther	9	16	The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.	19
Esther	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	19
Esther	9	18	But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.	19
Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.	19
Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,	19
Esther	9	21	to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,	19
Esther	9	22	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.	19
Esther	9	23	The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;	19
Esther	9	24	because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;	19
Esther	9	25	but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.	19
Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim,{Purim is the Hebrew plural for pur, which means lot.} from the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,	19
Esther	9	27	the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;	19
Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their seed.	19
Esther	9	29	Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.	19
Esther	9	30	He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,	19
Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.	19
Esther	9	32	The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.	19
Esther	10	1	King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.	19
Esther	10	2	All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?	19
Ruth	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did that which was right in his own eyes.	20
Ruth	1	1	It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.	20
Ruth	1	2	The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab, and continued there.	20
Ruth	1	3	Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.	20
Ruth	1	4	They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years.	20
Ruth	1	5	Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.	20
Ruth	1	6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.	20
Ruth	1	7	She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.	20
Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.	20
Ruth	1	9	Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.	20
Ruth	1	10	They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.	20
Ruth	1	11	Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?	20
Ruth	1	12	Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;	20
Ruth	1	13	would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh is gone forth against me.	20
Ruth	1	14	They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.	20
Ruth	1	15	She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.	20
Ruth	1	16	Ruth said, Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;	20
Ruth	1	17	where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part you and me.	20
Ruth	1	18	When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.	20
Ruth	1	19	So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?	20
Ruth	1	20	She said to them, Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.	20
Ruth	1	21	I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?	20
Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.	20
Ruth	2	1	Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.	20
Ruth	2	2	Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.	20
Ruth	2	3	She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.	20
Ruth	2	4	Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.	20
Ruth	2	5	Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?	20
Ruth	2	6	The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:	20
Ruth	2	7	She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.	20
Ruth	2	8	Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.	20
Ruth	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.	20
Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?	20
Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn't know before.	20
Ruth	2	12	Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.	20
Ruth	2	13	Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.	20
Ruth	2	14	At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.	20
Ruth	2	15	When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her.	20
Ruth	2	16	Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.	20
Ruth	2	17	So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.	20
Ruth	2	18	She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.	20
Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.	20
Ruth	2	20	Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.	20
Ruth	2	21	Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.	20
Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.	20
Ruth	2	23	So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.	20
Ruth	3	1	Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?	20
Ruth	3	2	Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.	20
Ruth	3	3	Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.	20
Ruth	3	4	It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.	20
Ruth	3	5	She said to her, All that you say I will do.	20
Ruth	3	6	She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her.	20
Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.	20
Ruth	3	8	It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.	20
Ruth	3	9	He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.	20
Ruth	3	10	He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich.	20
Ruth	3	11	Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.	20
Ruth	3	12	Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.	20
Ruth	3	13	Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.	20
Ruth	3	14	She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.	20
Ruth	3	15	He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.	20
Ruth	3	16	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.	20
Ruth	3	17	She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said, Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.	20
Ruth	3	18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.	20
Ruth	4	1	Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.	20
Ruth	4	2	He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you down here.  They sat down.	20
Ruth	4	3	He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:	20
Ruth	4	4	I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. He said, I will redeem it.	20
Ruth	4	5	Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.	20
Ruth	4	6	The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you; for I can't redeem it.	20
Ruth	4	7	Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.	20
Ruth	4	8	So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He drew off his shoe.	20
Ruth	4	9	Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.	20
Ruth	4	10	Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.	20
Ruth	4	11	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:	20
Ruth	4	12	and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.	20
Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.	20
Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.	20
Ruth	4	15	He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.	20
Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.	20
Ruth	4	17	The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.	20
Ruth	4	18	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became the father of Hezron,	20
Ruth	4	19	and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,	20
Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,	20
Ruth	4	21	and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,	20
Hebrews	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.	21
Hebrews	1	1	God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,	21
Hebrews	1	2	has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds.	21
Hebrews	1	3	His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;	21
Hebrews	1	4	having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have.	21
Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did he say at any time, You are my Son. Today have I become your father?{Psalm 2:7} and again, I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?{2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13}	21
Hebrews	1	6	Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, Let all the angels of God worship him.	21
Hebrews	1	7	Of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire.{Psalm 104:4}	21
Hebrews	1	8	But of the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.	21
Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.{Psalm 45:6-7}	21
Hebrews	1	10	And, You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands.	21
Hebrews	1	11	They will perish, but you continue.  They all will grow old like a garment does.	21
Hebrews	1	12	As a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same.  Your years will not fail.{Psalm 102:25-27}	21
Hebrews	1	13	But which of the angels has he told at any time, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?{Psalm 110:1}	21
Hebrews	1	14	Aren't they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?	21
Hebrews	2	1	Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.	21
Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;	21
Hebrews	2	3	how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation-- which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;	21
Hebrews	2	4	God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?	21
Hebrews	2	5	For he didn't subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.	21
Hebrews	2	6	But one has somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that you think of him?  Or the son of man, that you care for him?	21
Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels.  You crowned him with glory and honor.{TR adds and set him over the works of your hands}	21
Hebrews	2	8	You have put all things in subjection under his feet.{Psalm 8:4-6} For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him.  But now we don't see all things subjected to him, yet.	21
Hebrews	2	9	But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.	21
Hebrews	2	10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	21
Hebrews	2	11	For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.},	21
Hebrews	2	12	saying, I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.{Psalm 22:22}	21
Hebrews	2	13	Again, I will put my trust in him.{Isaiah 8:17} Again, Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me.{Isaiah 8:18}	21
Hebrews	2	14	Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,	21
Hebrews	2	15	and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	21
Hebrews	2	16	For most certainly, he doesn't give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.	21
Hebrews	2	17	Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.	21
Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.	21
Hebrews	3	1	Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;	21
Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.	21
Hebrews	3	3	For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.	21
Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.	21
Hebrews	3	5	Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,	21
Hebrews	3	6	but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.	21
Hebrews	3	7	Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear his voice,	21
Hebrews	3	8	don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,	21
Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years.	21
Hebrews	3	10	Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, 'They always err in their heart, but they didn't know my ways;'	21
Hebrews	3	11	as I swore in my wrath, 'They will not enter into my rest.'{Psalm 95:7-11}	21
Hebrews	3	12	Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;	21
Hebrews	3	13	but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.	21
Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:	21
Hebrews	3	15	while it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.{Psalm 95:7-8}	21
Hebrews	3	16	For who, when they heard, rebelled?  No, didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?	21
Hebrews	3	17	With whom was he displeased forty years?  Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?	21
Hebrews	3	18	To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?	21
Hebrews	3	19	We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.	21
Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.	21
Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.	21
Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;{Psalm 95:11} although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	21
Hebrews	4	4	For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, God rested on the seventh day from all his works;{Genesis 2:2}	21
Hebrews	4	5	and in this place again, They will not enter into my rest.{Psalm 95:11}	21
Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,	21
Hebrews	4	7	he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), Today if you will hear his voice, don't harden your hearts.{Psalm 95:7-8}	21
Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.	21
Hebrews	4	9	There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.	21
Hebrews	4	10	For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.	21
Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.	21
Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.	21
Hebrews	4	13	There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	21
Hebrews	4	14	Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.	21
Hebrews	4	15	For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.	21
Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.	21
Hebrews	5	1	For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.	21
Hebrews	5	2	The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.	21
Hebrews	5	3	Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.	21
Hebrews	5	4	Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.	21
Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, You are my Son. Today I have become your father.{Psalm 2:7}	21
Hebrews	5	6	As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}	21
Hebrews	5	7	He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,	21
Hebrews	5	8	though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.	21
Hebrews	5	9	Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,	21
Hebrews	5	10	named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.	21
Hebrews	5	11	About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.	21
Hebrews	5	12	For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.	21
Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.	21
Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.	21
Hebrews	6	1	Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,	21
Hebrews	6	2	of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	21
Hebrews	6	3	This will we do, if God permits.	21
Hebrews	6	4	For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,	21
Hebrews	6	5	and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,	21
Hebrews	6	6	and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.	21
Hebrews	6	7	For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;	21
Hebrews	6	8	but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.	21
Hebrews	6	9	But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.	21
Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.	21
Hebrews	6	11	We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,	21
Hebrews	6	12	that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises.	21
Hebrews	6	13	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,	21
Hebrews	6	14	saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.{Genesis 22:17}	21
Hebrews	6	15	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	21
Hebrews	6	16	For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.	21
Hebrews	6	17	In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;	21
Hebrews	6	18	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.	21
Hebrews	6	19	This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;	21
Hebrews	6	20	where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.	21
Hebrews	7	1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,	21
Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;	21
Hebrews	7	3	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.	21
Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.	21
Hebrews	7	5	They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,	21
Hebrews	7	6	but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.	21
Hebrews	7	7	But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.	21
Hebrews	7	8	Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.	21
Hebrews	7	9	We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,	21
Hebrews	7	10	for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.	21
Hebrews	7	11	Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	21
Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.	21
Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.	21
Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.	21
Hebrews	7	15	This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,	21
Hebrews	7	16	who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:	21
Hebrews	7	17	for it is testified, You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.{Psalm 110:4}	21
Hebrews	7	18	For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness	21
Hebrews	7	19	(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.	21
Hebrews	7	20	Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath	21
Hebrews	7	21	(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him, The Lord swore and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.'{Psalm 110:4}	21
Hebrews	7	22	By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.	21
Hebrews	7	23	Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.	21
Hebrews	7	24	But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.	21
Hebrews	7	25	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.	21
Hebrews	7	26	For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	21
Hebrews	7	27	who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.	21
Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected.	21
Hebrews	8	1	Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,	21
Hebrews	8	2	a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.	21
Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices.  Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.	21
Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;	21
Hebrews	8	5	who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.{Exodus 25:40}	21
Hebrews	8	6	But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.	21
Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.	21
Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;	21
Hebrews	8	9	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn't continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.	21
Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.	21
Hebrews	8	11	They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,{TR reads neighbor instead of fellow citizen} and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.	21
Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.  I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.{Jeremiah 31:31-34}	21
Hebrews	8	13	In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.	21
Hebrews	9	1	Now indeed even the first{TR adds tabernacle} covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary.	21
Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was prepared.  In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.	21
Hebrews	9	3	After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,	21
Hebrews	9	4	having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;	21
Hebrews	9	5	and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can't speak now in detail.	21
Hebrews	9	6	Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,	21
Hebrews	9	7	but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.	21
Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;	21
Hebrews	9	9	which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;	21
Hebrews	9	10	being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.	21
Hebrews	9	11	But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,	21
Hebrews	9	12	nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.	21
Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:	21
Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	21
Hebrews	9	15	For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.	21
Hebrews	9	16	For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.	21
Hebrews	9	17	For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.	21
Hebrews	9	18	Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.	21
Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,	21
Hebrews	9	20	saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.{Exodus 24:8}	21
Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood.	21
Hebrews	9	22	According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.	21
Hebrews	9	23	It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	21
Hebrews	9	24	For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;	21
Hebrews	9	25	nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,	21
Hebrews	9	26	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world.  But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	21
Hebrews	9	27	Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,	21
Hebrews	9	28	so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.	21
Hebrews	10	1	For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.	21
Hebrews	10	2	Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?	21
Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins.	21
Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.	21
Hebrews	10	5	Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire, but you prepared a body for me;	21
Hebrews	10	6	You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.	21
Hebrews	10	7	Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.'{Psalm 40:6-8}	21
Hebrews	10	8	Previously saying, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had pleasure in them (those which are offered according to the law),	21
Hebrews	10	9	then he has said, Behold, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,	21
Hebrews	10	10	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.	21
Hebrews	10	11	Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,	21
Hebrews	10	12	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;	21
Hebrews	10	13	from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.	21
Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.	21
Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,	21
Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them: 'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'{Jeremiah 31:33} then he says,	21
Hebrews	10	17	I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.{Jeremiah 31:34}	21
Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.	21
Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,	21
Hebrews	10	20	by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	21
Hebrews	10	21	and having a great priest over the house of God,	21
Hebrews	10	22	let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,	21
Hebrews	10	23	let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.	21
Hebrews	10	24	Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,	21
Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.	21
Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,	21
Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.	21
Hebrews	10	28	A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.	21
Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?	21
Hebrews	10	30	For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, says the Lord, I will repay.{Deuteronomy 32:35} Again, The Lord will judge his people.{Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14}	21
Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	21
Hebrews	10	32	But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;	21
Hebrews	10	33	partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.	21
Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.	21
Hebrews	10	35	Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.	21
Hebrews	10	36	For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.	21
Hebrews	10	37	In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.	21
Hebrews	10	38	But the righteous will live by faith.  If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.{Habakkuk 2:3-4}	21
Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.	21
Hebrews	11	1	Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.	21
Hebrews	11	2	For by this, the elders obtained testimony.	21
Hebrews	11	3	By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.	21
Hebrews	11	4	By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.	21
Hebrews	11	5	By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn't see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.	21
Hebrews	11	6	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.	21
Hebrews	11	7	By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.	21
Hebrews	11	8	By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.	21
Hebrews	11	9	By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.	21
Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.	21
Hebrews	11	11	By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.	21
Hebrews	11	12	Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.	21
Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen{TR adds and being convinced of} them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	21
Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.	21
Hebrews	11	15	If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.	21
Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.	21
Hebrews	11	17	By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;	21
Hebrews	11	18	even he to whom it was said, In Isaac will your seed be called;{Genesis 21:12}	21
Hebrews	11	19	concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.	21
Hebrews	11	20	By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.	21
Hebrews	11	21	By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.	21
Hebrews	11	22	By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones.	21
Hebrews	11	23	By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.	21
Hebrews	11	24	By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,	21
Hebrews	11	25	choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;	21
Hebrews	11	26	accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.	21
Hebrews	11	27	By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	21
Hebrews	11	28	By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.	21
Hebrews	11	29	By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.	21
Hebrews	11	30	By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.	21
Hebrews	11	31	By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.	21
Hebrews	11	32	What more shall I say?  For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;	21
Hebrews	11	33	who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,{Daniel 6:22-23}	21
Hebrews	11	34	quenched the power of fire,{Daniel 3:1-30} escaped the edge of the sword,{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.	21
Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead by resurrection.{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.	21
Hebrews	11	36	Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.	21
Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned.{2 Chronicles 24:20-21} They were sawn apart. They were tempted.  They were slain with the sword.{Jeremiah 26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10} They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated	21
Hebrews	11	38	(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.	21
Hebrews	11	39	These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn't receive the promise,	21
Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.	21
Hebrews	12	1	Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	21
Hebrews	12	2	looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.	21
Hebrews	12	3	For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.	21
Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;	21
Hebrews	12	5	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;	21
Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.{Proverbs 3:11-12}	21
Hebrews	12	7	It is for discipline that you endure.  God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?	21
Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children.	21
Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect.  Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?	21
Hebrews	12	10	For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.	21
Hebrews	12	11	All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.	21
Hebrews	12	12	Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,{Isaiah 35:3}	21
Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet,{Proverbs 4:26} so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.	21
Hebrews	12	14	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,	21
Hebrews	12	15	looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;	21
Hebrews	12	16	lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.	21
Hebrews	12	17	For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.	21
Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,	21
Hebrews	12	19	the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,	21
Hebrews	12	20	for they could not stand that which was commanded, If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned{TR adds or shot with an arrow [see Exodus 19:12-13]};{Exodus 19:12-13}	21
Hebrews	12	21	and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.{Deuteronomy 9:19}	21
Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,	21
Hebrews	12	23	to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,	21
Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,{Jeremiah 31:31} and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.	21
Hebrews	12	25	See that you don't refuse him who speaks.  For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,	21
Hebrews	12	26	whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.{Haggai 2:6}	21
Hebrews	12	27	This phrase, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.	21
Hebrews	12	28	Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,	21
Hebrews	12	29	for our God is a consuming fire.{Deuteronomy 4:24}	21
Hebrews	13	1	Let brotherly love continue.	21
Hebrews	13	2	Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.	21
Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.	21
Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled:  but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.	21
Hebrews	13	5	Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you.{Deuteronomy 31:6}	21
Hebrews	13	6	So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper. I will not fear.  What can man do to me?{Psalm 118:6-7}	21
Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.	21
Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.	21
Hebrews	13	9	Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.	21
Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.	21
Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp.{Leviticus 16:27}	21
Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.	21
Hebrews	13	13	Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.	21
Hebrews	13	14	For we don't have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.	21
Hebrews	13	15	Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God{Psalm 50:23} continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.	21
Hebrews	13	16	But don't forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.	21
Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.	21
Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.	21
Hebrews	13	19	I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.	21
Hebrews	13	20	Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,	21
Hebrews	13	21	make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	21
Hebrews	13	22	But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.	21
Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.	21
Hebrews	13	24	Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.	21
Ephesians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.  Amen.	22
Ephesians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:	22
Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;	22
Ephesians	1	4	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;	22
Ephesians	1	5	having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,	22
Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,	22
Ephesians	1	7	in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,	22
Ephesians	1	8	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,	22
Ephesians	1	9	making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him	22
Ephesians	1	10	to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;	22
Ephesians	1	11	in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;	22
Ephesians	1	12	to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:	22
Ephesians	1	13	in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,	22
Ephesians	1	14	who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.	22
Ephesians	1	15	For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,	22
Ephesians	1	16	don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,	22
Ephesians	1	17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;	22
Ephesians	1	18	having the eyes of your hearts{TR reads understanding instead of hearts} enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,	22
Ephesians	1	19	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might	22
Ephesians	1	20	which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,	22
Ephesians	1	21	far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.	22
Ephesians	1	22	He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,	22
Ephesians	1	23	which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.	22
Ephesians	2	1	You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,	22
Ephesians	2	2	in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;	22
Ephesians	2	3	among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.	22
Ephesians	2	4	But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,	22
Ephesians	2	5	even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),	22
Ephesians	2	6	and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,	22
Ephesians	2	7	that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;	22
Ephesians	2	8	for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,	22
Ephesians	2	9	not of works, that no one would boast.	22
Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.	22
Ephesians	2	11	Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, (in the flesh, made by hands);	22
Ephesians	2	12	that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.	22
Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.	22
Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,	22
Ephesians	2	15	having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;	22
Ephesians	2	16	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.	22
Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.	22
Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.	22
Ephesians	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,	22
Ephesians	2	20	being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;	22
Ephesians	2	21	in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;	22
Ephesians	2	22	in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.	22
Ephesians	3	1	For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,	22
Ephesians	3	2	if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;	22
Ephesians	3	3	how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,	22
Ephesians	3	4	by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;	22
Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;	22
Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,	22
Ephesians	3	7	of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.	22
Ephesians	3	8	To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,	22
Ephesians	3	9	and to make all men see what is the administration{TR reads fellowship instead of administration} of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;	22
Ephesians	3	10	to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,	22
Ephesians	3	11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;	22
Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.	22
Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.	22
Ephesians	3	14	For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	22
Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,	22
Ephesians	3	16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;	22
Ephesians	3	17	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,	22
Ephesians	3	18	may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,	22
Ephesians	3	19	and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.	22
Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,	22
Ephesians	3	21	to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever.  Amen.	22
Ephesians	4	1	I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,	22
Ephesians	4	2	with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;	22
Ephesians	4	3	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	22
Ephesians	4	4	There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;	22
Ephesians	4	5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,	22
Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.	22
Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.	22
Ephesians	4	8	Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.{Psalm 68:18}	22
Ephesians	4	9	Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?	22
Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.	22
Ephesians	4	11	He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds{or, pastors} and teachers;	22
Ephesians	4	12	for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;	22
Ephesians	4	13	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;	22
Ephesians	4	14	that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;	22
Ephesians	4	15	but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;	22
Ephesians	4	16	from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.	22
Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,	22
Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;	22
Ephesians	4	19	who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	22
Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ that way;	22
Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:	22
Ephesians	4	22	that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;	22
Ephesians	4	23	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,	22
Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.	22
Ephesians	4	25	Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor.  For we are members of one another.	22
Ephesians	4	26	Be angry, and don't sin.{Psalm 4:4} Don't let the sun go down on your wrath,	22
Ephesians	4	27	neither give place to the devil.	22
Ephesians	4	28	Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.	22
Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.	22
Ephesians	4	30	Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.	22
Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.	22
Ephesians	4	32	And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.	22
Ephesians	5	1	Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.	22
Ephesians	5	2	Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.	22
Ephesians	5	3	But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;	22
Ephesians	5	4	nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.	22
Ephesians	5	5	Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.	22
Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words.  For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.	22
Ephesians	5	7	Therefore don't be partakers with them.	22
Ephesians	5	8	For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,	22
Ephesians	5	9	for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,	22
Ephesians	5	10	proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.	22
Ephesians	5	11	Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.	22
Ephesians	5	12	For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.	22
Ephesians	5	13	But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.	22
Ephesians	5	14	Therefore he says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.	22
Ephesians	5	15	Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;	22
Ephesians	5	16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	22
Ephesians	5	17	Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.	22
Ephesians	5	18	Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,	22
Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;	22
Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;	22
Ephesians	5	21	subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.	22
Ephesians	5	22	Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.	22
Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.	22
Ephesians	5	24	But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.	22
Ephesians	5	25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;	22
Ephesians	5	26	that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,	22
Ephesians	5	27	that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	22
Ephesians	5	28	Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies.  He who loves his own wife loves himself.	22
Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;	22
Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.	22
Ephesians	5	31	For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife.  The two will become one flesh.{Genesis 2:24}	22
Ephesians	5	32	This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.	22
Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.	22
Ephesians	6	1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.	22
Ephesians	6	2	Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:	22
Ephesians	6	3	that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.{Deuteronomy 5:16}	22
Ephesians	6	4	You fathers, don't provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.	22
Ephesians	6	5	Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;	22
Ephesians	6	6	not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;	22
Ephesians	6	7	with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;	22
Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.	22
Ephesians	6	9	You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.	22
Ephesians	6	10	Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.	22
Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	22
Ephesians	6	12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.	22
Ephesians	6	13	Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.	22
Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,	22
Ephesians	6	15	and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;	22
Ephesians	6	16	above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.	22
Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;	22
Ephesians	6	18	with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:	22
Ephesians	6	19	on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,	22
Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	22
Ephesians	6	21	But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;	22
Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.	22
Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	22
2 Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.	23
2 Thessalonians	1	1	Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:	23
2 Thessalonians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	23
2 Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;	23
2 Thessalonians	1	4	so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.	23
2 Thessalonians	1	5	This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.	23
2 Thessalonians	1	6	Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,	23
2 Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,	23
2 Thessalonians	1	8	giving vengeance to those who don't know God, and to those who don't obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,	23
2 Thessalonians	1	9	who will pay the penalty:  eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,	23
2 Thessalonians	1	10	when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.	23
2 Thessalonians	1	11	To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;	23
2 Thessalonians	1	12	that the name of our Lord Jesus{TR adds Christ} may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	1	Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you	23
2 Thessalonians	2	2	not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ had come.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one deceive you in any way.  For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,	23
2 Thessalonians	2	4	he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	5	Don't you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?	23
2 Thessalonians	2	6	Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness already works.  Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;	23
2 Thessalonians	2	9	even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,	23
2 Thessalonians	2	10	and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn't receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	11	Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;	23
2 Thessalonians	2	12	that they all might be judged who didn't believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;	23
2 Thessalonians	2	14	to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	15	So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter.	23
2 Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,	23
2 Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	1	Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;	23
2 Thessalonians	3	2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	7	For you know how you ought to imitate us.  For we didn't behave ourselves rebelliously among you,	23
2 Thessalonians	3	8	neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;	23
2 Thessalonians	3	9	not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don't work at all, but are busybodies.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	12	Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	13	But you, brothers, don't be weary in doing well.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	14	If any man doesn't obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	15	Don't count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways.  The Lord be with you all.	23
2 Thessalonians	3	17	The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter:  this is how I write.	23
2 Corinthians	16	24	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.  Amen.	24
2 Corinthians	1	1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:	24
2 Corinthians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;	24
2 Corinthians	1	4	who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.	24
2 Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.	24
2 Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.	24
2 Corinthians	1	8	For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.	24
2 Corinthians	1	9	Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,	24
2 Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;	24
2 Corinthians	1	11	you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.	24
2 Corinthians	1	12	For our boasting is this:  the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.	24
2 Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;	24
2 Corinthians	1	14	as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.	24
2 Corinthians	1	15	In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;	24
2 Corinthians	1	16	and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.	24
2 Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the Yes, yes and the No, no?	24
2 Corinthians	1	18	But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not Yes and no.	24
2 Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and no, but in him is Yes.	24
2 Corinthians	1	20	For however many are the promises of God, in him is the Yes. Therefore also through him is the Amen, to the glory of God through us.	24
2 Corinthians	1	21	Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;	24
2 Corinthians	1	22	who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.	24
2 Corinthians	1	23	But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.	24
2 Corinthians	1	24	Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy.  For you stand firm in faith.	24
2 Corinthians	2	1	But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.	24
2 Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?	24
2 Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.	24
2 Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.	24
2 Corinthians	2	5	But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.	24
2 Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;	24
2 Corinthians	2	7	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.	24
2 Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.	24
2 Corinthians	2	9	For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.	24
2 Corinthians	2	10	Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,	24
2 Corinthians	2	11	that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.	24
2 Corinthians	2	12	Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,	24
2 Corinthians	2	13	I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.	24
2 Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.	24
2 Corinthians	2	15	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;	24
2 Corinthians	2	16	to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life.  Who is sufficient for these things?	24
2 Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	3	1	Are we beginning again to commend ourselves?  Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?	24
2 Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;	24
2 Corinthians	3	3	being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.	24
2 Corinthians	3	4	Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;	24
2 Corinthians	3	5	not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;	24
2 Corinthians	3	6	who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit.  For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.	24
2 Corinthians	3	7	But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:	24
2 Corinthians	3	8	won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?	24
2 Corinthians	3	9	For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.	24
2 Corinthians	3	10	For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.	24
2 Corinthians	3	11	For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.	24
2 Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,	24
2 Corinthians	3	13	and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.	24
2 Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.	24
2 Corinthians	3	15	But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.	24
2 Corinthians	3	16	But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.	24
2 Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.	24
2 Corinthians	3	18	But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.	24
2 Corinthians	4	1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don't faint.	24
2 Corinthians	4	2	But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.	24
2 Corinthians	4	3	Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;	24
2 Corinthians	4	4	in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.	24
2 Corinthians	4	5	For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;	24
2 Corinthians	4	6	seeing it is God who said, Light will shine out of darkness,{Genesis 1:3} who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.	24
2 Corinthians	4	8	We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;	24
2 Corinthians	4	9	pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;	24
2 Corinthians	4	10	always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.	24
2 Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.	24
2 Corinthians	4	12	So then death works in us, but life in you.	24
2 Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore I spoke.{Psalm 116:10} We also believe, and therefore also we speak;	24
2 Corinthians	4	14	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.	24
2 Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.	24
2 Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we don't faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.	24
2 Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;	24
2 Corinthians	4	18	while we don't look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.	24
2 Corinthians	5	1	For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.	24
2 Corinthians	5	2	For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;	24
2 Corinthians	5	3	if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.	24
2 Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.	24
2 Corinthians	5	5	Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.	24
2 Corinthians	5	6	Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;	24
2 Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith, not by sight.	24
2 Corinthians	5	8	We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.	24
2 Corinthians	5	9	Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.	24
2 Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.	24
2 Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.	24
2 Corinthians	5	12	For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.	24
2 Corinthians	5	13	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God.  Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.	24
2 Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.	24
2 Corinthians	5	15	He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.	24
2 Corinthians	5	16	Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.	24
2 Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away.  Behold, all things have become new.	24
2 Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;	24
2 Corinthians	5	19	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.	24
2 Corinthians	5	20	We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us.  We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.	24
2 Corinthians	5	21	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.	24
2 Corinthians	6	1	Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,	24
2 Corinthians	6	2	for he says, At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.{Isaiah 49:8} Behold, now is the acceptable time.  Behold, now is the day of salvation.	24
2 Corinthians	6	3	We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,	24
2 Corinthians	6	4	but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,	24
2 Corinthians	6	5	in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;	24
2 Corinthians	6	6	in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,	24
2 Corinthians	6	7	in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,	24
2 Corinthians	6	8	by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;	24
2 Corinthians	6	9	as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;	24
2 Corinthians	6	10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.	24
2 Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians.  Our heart is enlarged.	24
2 Corinthians	6	12	You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.	24
2 Corinthians	6	13	Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.	24
2 Corinthians	6	14	Don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity?  Or what communion has light with darkness?	24
2 Corinthians	6	15	What agreement has Christ with Belial?  Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?	24
2 Corinthians	6	16	What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God.  Even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.{Leviticus 26:12; Jeremiah 32:38; Ezekiel 37:27}	24
2 Corinthians	6	17	Therefore, 'Come out from among them, and be separate,' says the Lord.  'Touch no unclean thing.  I will receive you.{Isaiah 52:11; Ezekiel 20:34,41}	24
2 Corinthians	6	18	I will be to you a Father.  You will be to me sons and daughters,' says the Lord Almighty.{2 Samuel 7:14; 7:8}	24
2 Corinthians	7	1	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	24
2 Corinthians	7	2	Open your hearts to us.  We wronged no one.  We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.	24
2 Corinthians	7	3	I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.	24
2 Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you.  Great is my boasting on your behalf.  I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.	24
2 Corinthians	7	5	For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side.  Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.	24
2 Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	24
2 Corinthians	7	7	and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.	24
2 Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it.  For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.	24
2 Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance.  For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.	24
2 Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret.  But the sorrow of the world works death.	24
2 Corinthians	7	11	For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.	24
2 Corinthians	7	12	So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.	24
2 Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we have been comforted.  In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.	24
2 Corinthians	7	14	For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed.  But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.	24
2 Corinthians	7	15	His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.	24
2 Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.	24
2 Corinthians	8	1	Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;	24
2 Corinthians	8	2	how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.	24
2 Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,	24
2 Corinthians	8	4	begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.	24
2 Corinthians	8	5	This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.	24
2 Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.	24
2 Corinthians	8	7	But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.	24
2 Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.	24
2 Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.	24
2 Corinthians	8	10	I give a judgment in this:  for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.	24
2 Corinthians	8	11	But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.	24
2 Corinthians	8	12	For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don't have.	24
2 Corinthians	8	13	For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,	24
2 Corinthians	8	14	but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.	24
2 Corinthians	8	15	As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.{Exodus 16:8}	24
2 Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.	24
2 Corinthians	8	17	For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.	24
2 Corinthians	8	18	We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.	24
2 Corinthians	8	19	Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.	24
2 Corinthians	8	20	We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.	24
2 Corinthians	8	21	Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	24
2 Corinthians	8	22	We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.	24
2 Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.	24
2 Corinthians	9	1	It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,	24
2 Corinthians	9	2	for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.	24
2 Corinthians	9	3	But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,	24
2 Corinthians	9	4	so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.	24
2 Corinthians	9	5	I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.	24
2 Corinthians	9	6	Remember this:  he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.	24
2 Corinthians	9	7	Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.	24
2 Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.	24
2 Corinthians	9	9	As it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.{Psalm 112:9}	24
2 Corinthians	9	10	Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;	24
2 Corinthians	9	11	you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.	24
2 Corinthians	9	12	For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;	24
2 Corinthians	9	13	seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;	24
2 Corinthians	9	14	while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.	24
2 Corinthians	9	15	Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!	24
2 Corinthians	10	1	Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you.	24
2 Corinthians	10	2	Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.	24
2 Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according to the flesh;	24
2 Corinthians	10	4	for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,	24
2 Corinthians	10	5	throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;	24
2 Corinthians	10	6	and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.	24
2 Corinthians	10	7	Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's.	24
2 Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,	24
2 Corinthians	10	9	that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.	24
2 Corinthians	10	10	For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.	24
2 Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.	24
2 Corinthians	10	12	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves.  But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.	24
2 Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.	24
2 Corinthians	10	14	For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't reach to you.  For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,	24
2 Corinthians	10	15	not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,	24
2 Corinthians	10	16	so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.	24
2 Corinthians	10	17	But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.{Jeremiah 9:24}	24
2 Corinthians	10	18	For it isn't he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.	24
2 Corinthians	11	1	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.	24
2 Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.	24
2 Corinthians	11	4	For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.	24
2 Corinthians	11	5	For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.	24
2 Corinthians	11	6	But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge.  No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.	24
2 Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?	24
2 Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.	24
2 Corinthians	11	9	When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need.  In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.	24
2 Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.	24
2 Corinthians	11	11	Why?  Because I don't love you?  God knows.	24
2 Corinthians	11	12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.	24
2 Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles.	24
2 Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.	24
2 Corinthians	11	15	It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.	24
2 Corinthians	11	16	I say again, let no one think me foolish.  But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.	24
2 Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak, I don't speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.	24
2 Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.	24
2 Corinthians	11	19	For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.	24
2 Corinthians	11	20	For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.	24
2 Corinthians	11	21	I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.	24
2 Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews?  So am I. Are they Israelites?  So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham?  So am I.	24
2 Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ?  (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.	24
2 Corinthians	11	24	Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.	24
2 Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods.  Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck.  I have been a night and a day in the deep.	24
2 Corinthians	11	26	I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;	24
2 Corinthians	11	27	in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.	24
2 Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.	24
2 Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is caused to stumble, and I don't burn with indignation?	24
2 Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.	24
2 Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don't lie.	24
2 Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.	24
2 Corinthians	11	33	Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.	24
2 Corinthians	12	1	It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	24
2 Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don't know, or whether out of the body, I don't know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.	24
2 Corinthians	12	3	I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don't know; God knows),	24
2 Corinthians	12	4	how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.	24
2 Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.	24
2 Corinthians	12	6	For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth.  But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.	24
2 Corinthians	12	7	By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.	24
2 Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.	24
2 Corinthians	12	9	He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.	24
2 Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.	24
2 Corinthians	12	11	I have become foolish in boasting.  You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.	24
2 Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.	24
2 Corinthians	12	13	For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.	24
2 Corinthians	12	14	Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you.  For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	24
2 Corinthians	12	15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?	24
2 Corinthians	12	16	But be it so, I did not myself burden you.  But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.	24
2 Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?	24
2 Corinthians	12	18	I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.  Did Titus take any advantage of you?  Didn't we walk in the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps?	24
2 Corinthians	12	19	Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ.  But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.	24
2 Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don't desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;	24
2 Corinthians	12	21	that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.	24
2 Corinthians	13	1	This is the third time I am coming to you.  At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word established.{Deuteronomy 19:15}	24
2 Corinthians	13	2	I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;	24
2 Corinthians	13	3	seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.	24
2 Corinthians	13	4	For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God.  For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.	24
2 Corinthians	13	5	Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves.  Or don't you know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you are disqualified.	24
2 Corinthians	13	6	But I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.	24
2 Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.	24
2 Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.	24
2 Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.	24
2 Corinthians	13	10	For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.	24
2 Corinthians	13	11	Finally, brothers, rejoice.  Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.	24
2 Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.	24
2 Corinthians	13	13	All the saints greet you.	24
1 John	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To him be the glory both now and forever.  Amen.	25
1 John	1	1	That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life	25
1 John	1	2	(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);	25
1 John	1	3	that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us.  Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.	25
1 John	1	4	And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.	25
1 John	1	5	This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	25
1 John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth.	25
1 John	1	7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.	25
1 John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	25
1 John	1	9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	25
1 John	1	10	If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	25
1 John	2	1	My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin.  If anyone sins, we have a Counselor{Greek Parakleton: Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, and Comfortor.} with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.	25
1 John	2	2	And he is the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.	25
1 John	2	3	This is how we know that we know him:  if we keep his commandments.	25
1 John	2	4	One who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn't in him.	25
1 John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word, God's love has most certainly been perfected in him.  This is how we know that we are in him:	25
1 John	2	6	he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.	25
1 John	2	7	Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.	25
1 John	2	8	Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.	25
1 John	2	9	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.	25
1 John	2	10	He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.	25
1 John	2	11	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.	25
1 John	2	12	I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.	25
1 John	2	13	I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.  I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.	25
1 John	2	14	I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.  I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.	25
1 John	2	15	Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love isn't in him.	25
1 John	2	16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isn't the Father's, but is the world's.	25
1 John	2	17	The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.	25
1 John	2	18	Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.	25
1 John	2	19	They went out from us, but they didn't belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.	25
1 John	2	20	You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know the truth.	25
1 John	2	21	I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.	25
1 John	2	22	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.	25
1 John	2	23	Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.	25
1 John	2	24	Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning.  If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.	25
1 John	2	25	This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.	25
1 John	2	26	These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.	25
1 John	2	27	As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you don't need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him.	25
1 John	2	28	Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	25
1 John	2	29	If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him.	25
1 John	3	1	Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!  For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it didn't know him.	25
1 John	3	2	Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be.  But we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.	25
1 John	3	3	Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.	25
1 John	3	4	Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness.  Sin is lawlessness.	25
1 John	3	5	You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.	25
1 John	3	6	Whoever remains in him doesn't sin.  Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.	25
1 John	3	7	Little children, let no one lead you astray.  He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.	25
1 John	3	8	He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.  To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	25
1 John	3	9	Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he can't sin, because he is born of God.	25
1 John	3	10	In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil.  Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn't love his brother.	25
1 John	3	11	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;	25
1 John	3	12	unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him?  Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.	25
1 John	3	13	Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.	25
1 John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.  He who doesn't love his brother remains in death.	25
1 John	3	15	Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.	25
1 John	3	16	By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.	25
1 John	3	17	But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?	25
1 John	3	18	My little children, let's not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.	25
1 John	3	19	And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,	25
1 John	3	20	because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.	25
1 John	3	21	Beloved, if our hearts don't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;	25
1 John	3	22	and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.	25
1 John	3	23	This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded.	25
1 John	3	24	He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.	25
1 John	4	1	Beloved, don't believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.	25
1 John	4	2	By this you know the Spirit of God:  every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,	25
1 John	4	3	and every spirit who doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.	25
1 John	4	4	You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.	25
1 John	4	5	They are of the world.  Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.	25
1 John	4	6	We are of God.  He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn't listen to us.  By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	25
1 John	4	7	Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.	25
1 John	4	8	He who doesn't love doesn't know God, for God is love.	25
1 John	4	9	By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.	25
1 John	4	10	In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice{atoning sacrifice is from the Greek hilasmos, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation--the sacrifice that turns away God's wrath because of our sin.} for our sins.	25
1 John	4	11	Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.	25
1 John	4	12	No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.	25
1 John	4	13	By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.	25
1 John	4	14	We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.	25
1 John	4	15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.	25
1 John	4	16	We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.	25
1 John	4	17	In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.	25
1 John	4	18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made perfect in love.	25
1 John	4	19	We love Him, because he first loved us.	25
1 John	4	20	If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?	25
1 John	4	21	This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.	25
1 John	5	1	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him.	25
1 John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.	25
1 John	5	3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.	25
1 John	5	4	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world:  your faith.	25
1 John	5	5	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	25
1 John	5	6	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.	25
1 John	5	7	For there are three who testify{Only a few recent manuscripts add in heaven:  the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.  And there are three that testify on earth}:	25
1 John	5	8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.	25
1 John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony which he has testified concerning his Son.	25
1 John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn't believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.	25
1 John	5	11	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	25
1 John	5	12	He who has the Son has the life.  He who doesn't have God's Son doesn't have the life.	25
1 John	5	13	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.	25
1 John	5	14	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.	25
1 John	5	15	And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.	25
1 John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death. I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.	25
1 John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.	25
1 John	5	18	We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.	25
1 John	5	19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.	25
1 John	5	20	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	25
2 John	5	21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols.	26
2 John	1	1	The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;	26
2 John	1	2	for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:	26
2 John	1	3	Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	26
2 John	1	4	I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.	26
2 John	1	5	Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	26
2 John	1	6	This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.	26
2 John	1	7	For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.	26
2 John	1	8	Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.	26
2 John	1	9	Whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God.  He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.	26
2 John	1	10	If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,	26
2 John	1	11	for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.	26
2 John	1	12	Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.	26
Galatians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.  Amen.	27
Galatians	1	1	Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),	27
Galatians	1	2	and all the brothers{The word for brothers here and where context allows may also be correctly translated brothers and sisters or siblings.} who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:	27
Galatians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,	27
Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father--	27
Galatians	1	5	to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.	27
Galatians	1	6	I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different good news;	27
Galatians	1	7	and there isn't another good news.  Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.	27
Galatians	1	8	But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any good news other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.	27
Galatians	1	9	As we have said before, so I now say again:  if any man preaches to you any good news other than that which you received, let him be cursed.	27
Galatians	1	10	For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God?  Or am I striving to please men?  For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ.	27
Galatians	1	11	But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.	27
Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.	27
Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.	27
Galatians	1	14	I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.	27
Galatians	1	15	But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,	27
Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,	27
Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia.  Then I returned to Damascus.	27
Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.	27
Galatians	1	19	But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord's brother.	27
Galatians	1	20	Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying.	27
Galatians	1	21	Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	27
Galatians	1	22	I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,	27
Galatians	1	23	but they only heard:  He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.	27
Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me.	27
Galatians	2	1	Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.	27
Galatians	2	2	I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.	27
Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.	27
Galatians	2	4	This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;	27
Galatians	2	5	to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.	27
Galatians	2	6	But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn't show partiality to man)--they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,	27
Galatians	2	7	but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision	27
Galatians	2	8	(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);	27
Galatians	2	9	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.	27
Galatians	2	10	They only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing I was also zealous to do.	27
Galatians	2	11	But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.	27
Galatians	2	12	For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.	27
Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.	27
Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they didn't walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?	27
Galatians	2	15	We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,	27
Galatians	2	16	yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.	27
Galatians	2	17	But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!	27
Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.	27
Galatians	2	19	For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.	27
Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me.  That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.	27
Galatians	2	21	I don't make void the grace of God.  For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!	27
Galatians	3	1	Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?	27
Galatians	3	2	I just want to learn this from you.  Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?	27
Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish?  Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?	27
Galatians	3	4	Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?	27
Galatians	3	5	He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?	27
Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.	27
Galatians	3	7	Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.	27
Galatians	3	8	The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations will be blessed.{Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18}	27
Galatians	3	9	So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.	27
Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who doesn't continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.{Deuteronomy 27:26}	27
Galatians	3	11	Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, The righteous will live by faith.{Habakkuk 2:4}	27
Galatians	3	12	The law is not of faith, but, The man who does them will live by them.{Leviticus 18:5}	27
Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.  For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,{Deuteronomy 21:23}	27
Galatians	3	14	that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	27
Galatians	3	15	Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.	27
Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn't say, To seeds, as of many, but as of one, To your seed,{Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7} which is Christ.	27
Galatians	3	17	Now I say this.  A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.	27
Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.	27
Galatians	3	19	What then is the law?  It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.	27
Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.	27
Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.	27
Galatians	3	22	But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.	27
Galatians	3	23	But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	27
Galatians	3	24	So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	27
Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.	27
Galatians	3	26	For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.	27
Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	27
Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.	27
Galatians	3	29	If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.	27
Galatians	4	1	But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;	27
Galatians	4	2	but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.	27
Galatians	4	3	So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.	27
Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,	27
Galatians	4	5	that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.	27
Galatians	4	6	And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba,{Abba is a Greek spelling for the Aramaic word for Father or Daddy used in a familiar, respectful, and loving way.} Father!	27
Galatians	4	7	So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	27
Galatians	4	8	However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.	27
Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?	27
Galatians	4	10	You observe days, months, seasons, and years.	27
Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.	27
Galatians	4	12	I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are.  You did me no wrong,	27
Galatians	4	13	but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.	27
Galatians	4	14	That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.	27
Galatians	4	15	What was the blessing you enjoyed?  For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.	27
Galatians	4	16	So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?	27
Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek you in no good way.  No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.	27
Galatians	4	18	But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.	27
Galatians	4	19	My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--	27
Galatians	4	20	but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.	27
Galatians	4	21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?	27
Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.	27
Galatians	4	23	However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.	27
Galatians	4	24	These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.	27
Galatians	4	25	For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.	27
Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	27
Galatians	4	27	For it is written, Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband.{Isaiah 54:1}	27
Galatians	4	28	Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.	27
Galatians	4	29	But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.	27
Galatians	4	30	However what does the Scripture say?  Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman.{Genesis 21:10}	27
Galatians	4	31	So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.	27
Galatians	5	1	Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don't be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.	27
Galatians	5	2	Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.	27
Galatians	5	3	Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	27
Galatians	5	4	You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law.  You have fallen away from grace.	27
Galatians	5	5	For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.	27
Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.	27
Galatians	5	7	You were running well!  Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?	27
Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him who calls you.	27
Galatians	5	9	A little yeast grows through the whole lump.	27
Galatians	5	10	I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way.  But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.	27
Galatians	5	11	But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted?  Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.	27
Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.	27
Galatians	5	13	For you, brothers, were called for freedom.  Only don't use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.	27
Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.{Leviticus 19:18}	27
Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don't consume one another.	27
Galatians	5	16	But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh.	27
Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.	27
Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.	27
Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,	27
Galatians	5	20	idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,	27
Galatians	5	21	envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.	27
Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,{or, faithfulness}	27
Galatians	5	23	gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.	27
Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.	27
Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit, let's also walk by the Spirit.	27
Galatians	5	26	Let's not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.	27
Galatians	6	1	Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren't tempted.	27
Galatians	6	2	Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.	27
Galatians	6	3	For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.	27
Galatians	6	4	But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.	27
Galatians	6	5	For each man will bear his own burden.	27
Galatians	6	6	But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.	27
Galatians	6	7	Don't be deceived.  God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.	27
Galatians	6	8	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.	27
Galatians	6	9	Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don't give up.	27
Galatians	6	10	So then, as we have opportunity, let's do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.	27
Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.	27
Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.	27
Galatians	6	13	For even they who receive circumcision don't keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.	27
Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.	27
Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.	27
Galatians	6	16	As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel.	27
Galatians	6	17	From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.	27
